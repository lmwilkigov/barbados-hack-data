In 1625, the captain and crew of an English trading ship landed at Holetown (originally named James Town) and claimed possession of Barbados on behalf of James I, King of England (James VI of Scotland).
 
Barbados was colonised in 1627 in the name of Charles I (1625-49) by the Governor, Charles Wolferstone, as the representative of the Earl of Carlisle, after whom Carlisle Bay was named. The Governor appointed a Council comprising the main landowners to assist him in the government of the island. The island remained a British Colony until Independence was attained in 1966. However, Barbados was never grant-aided in any way during its colonial period. Barbados has always funded its own budget fully.
 
In 1629, Barbados was divided into six parishes. These were: Christ Church, Saint Michael, Saint James, Saint Thomas, Saint Peter and Saint Lucy.
 
Sixteen land-owners were chosen in 1639 to constitute the House of Burgesses, soon to become the House of Assembly. Candidates for the House of Burgesses were required to be property owners until the Representation of the People (Amendment) Act of 1950 gave to all persons aged 21 and over the right to vote without any income or property qualification and to contest elections also without any income or property qualification. The income and property qualifications were progressively lowered until the last modification in 1943.
 
Barbados was divided into the present 11 parishes in 1645. Each parish thereafter chose two representatives for the House of Assembly.
 
Col. Thomas Modyford was elected in 1652 as the first Speaker of the House of Assembly. Thereafter, the two Houses of Parliament, the Legislative Council and the House of Assembly, sat separately. Eventually the meetings of the Council were held for several years at the official residence of the Governor.
 
In 1813, John Brathwaite, Esquire, was elected by the Legislative Council as its first President.
 
In 1831, free coloured men who satisfied the property requirements became entitled to vote in elections for the House of Assembly. An Act was passed by which coloured men became eligible for election of the House of Assembly. In 1843, Samuel Jackman Prescod, the first coloured man to sit in the House, was one of two members elected to the House of Assembly for the new constituency of the City of Bridgetown. Thereafter, there were 24 members of the House of Assembly until 1981.
 
Sir Conrad Reeves, (member of the House of Assembly 1874-86 and Chief Justice of Barbados thereafter to 1902), the first black Knight, was among the first appointees to Executive Committee in 1881.
 
In 1884, the income qualification for the right to vote was fixed at £50 sterling ($240), a quite considerable sum at that time.
 
In 1885, an Act was passed "to require that all votes upon the taking of a poll at any election of Members to serve in the General Assembly, or in the several vestries of this island shall be given by ballot." Each parish elected a vestry annually to deal with local government matters affecting that parish.
 
In 1924, the Democratic League of Barbados, a pioneering black political group, was founded by Dr. Charles Duncan Oâ??Neal, its first President, who was also Founder and Patron of the Barbados Working Menâ??s Association. Dr. Oâ??Neal represented the City of Bridgetown in the House of Assembly during 1932-36.
 
The Barbados Progressive League, soon to become the Barbados Labour Party, was formed in April and launched in October 1938.
 
The House of Assembly was, from 1938, elected for two years.
 
In 1944, the income qualification for voters was reduced to sterling £20 from £50 where it had been set in 1884. Women acquired the right to vote and to become members of either House of Parliament but needed the same qualifications as men.
 
In the general election in November 1946, the Barbados Labour Party led by Sir Grantley Adams, won 9 seats, the West Indian National Congress Party led by Mr. Wynter A.

The year 1958 was a very busy year for Barbados. The Federation of The West Indies was formed with Sir Grantley Adams as Prime Minister. Dr. H. G. H. Cummins became the second Premier of Barbados in succession of Sir Grantley Adams. Cabinet Government began in Barbados. An Act was passed to make better provision for local Government in the island. It divided Barbados into (1) the City of Bridgetown with councillors elected for the separate wards or areas comprising (a) the City Ward (b) the Saint Michael Ward and (c) the Carlisle Ward, the City of Bridgetown becoming a corporation with a Mayor, Deputy Mayor, Aldermen (senior councillors) and Councillors, (2) the Northern District Council with a Chairman, Aldermen and Councillors and (3) the Southern District Council, with the same structure as in the North.
