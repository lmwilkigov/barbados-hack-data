may be significant, advise the Board that the applicant is required to
carry  out  an  initial  environmental  evaluation  in  relation  to  that
application;

in any case where the application is for proposed development of a
class listed in the Sixth Schedule to the Act, advise the Minister whether
the  application  may  be  exempted  from  the  requirement  that  an
environmental  impact  assessment  shall  be  carried  out,  pursuant  to
section 30(2) of the Act, in accordance with regulation 5; and

in the case of any other application, where the screening shows that the
adverse  impacts  of  the  proposed  development  are  likely  to  be
significant, advise the Director that an initial environmental evaluation

7

of the application before it is determined, pursuant to section 30(1) of
the Act.

The Director shall give the applicant notice of the decision to require, or
(5)
to dispense with the requirement, that an environmental impact assessment be
carried out with respect to the proposed development, as the case may be, no later
than 28 days after the date of the application, pursuant to section 27 of the Act.

Exemption from environmental impact assessment requirements

The Committee shall advise the Minister that an environmental impact
5.(1)
assessment is not required with respect to an application for a development of
any kind mentioned in the Sixth Schedule to the Act where

(a)

(b)

(c)

the application had been preceded by an application for approval in
principle;

an initial environmental evaluation was carried out with respect to the
conceptual plans for the development before approval in principle was
granted; and

the grant of approval in principle was not made subject to a condition
that  an  environmental  impact  assessment  be  carried  out  and  an
environmental impact statement submitted in relation to the application
for planning permission for the development.

Every direction given by the Minister pursuant to section 30(2) of the Act,
(2)
on the advice of the Committee, and published in accordance with section 2(3)
of the Act, shall contain a statement of reasons for the decision.

Publicity for applications

6.(1)
Where  an  applicant  is  notified  that  an  environmental  impact
assessment  is  required,  the  applicant  shall  publicize  the  application,  in
accordance to subsection 29(2)(a) of the Act, giving notice of the application to
the public in general, and particularly persons whose interests are likely to be
affected, directly or indirectly, by the proposed development.

8

Without prejudice to the generality of paragraph (1), within 14 days of

(2)
service of the notice, the applicant shall

(a)

(b)

cause a notice containing particulars of the application to be published
twice in at least one daily newspaper in general circulation in Barbados
or to be published electronically on the internet;

give copies of such notice to the owners or occupiers of every parcel
of land adjacent to the premises on which the proposed development
is to take place; and

(c)

object on the land where the proposed development is to take place.

(3)

Every such notice shall

(a)

(b)

include the name of the applicant, the reference number and date of the
application and a brief description of the proposed development; and

specify  that  an  environmental  impact  assessment  is  required  to  be
carried out with respect to the proposed development and that members
of  the  public  shall  be  afforded  the  opportunity  to  scrutinize  the
environmental
submit  objections  or
statement  and
representations with respect to the application in due course.

Initial Environmental Evaluation

7.(1)
evaluation

An  applicant  may  be  required  to  submit  an  initial  environment

(a)

(b)

in support of an application for approval in principle pursuant to section
25(3) of the Act; or

in  support  of  an  application  for  planning  permission  in  lieu  of  an
environmental  impact  assessment,  where  so  determined  by  the
Committee in accordance with the screening guidelines.

In every case where the Director requires an initial environment evaluation
(2)
in respect of an application for approval in principle, the applicant may submit

9

in  satisfaction  of  that  requirement  a  report  on  the  initial  environment
evaluation

(a)

(b)

(c)

predicting  the  main  impacts  of  the  proposed  development  and
evaluating the importance of those impacts;

indicating the key mitigating actions which would be required if the
development is permitted; and

identifying any significant gaps in knowledge and uncertainties about
environmental impacts which should be addressed by a more rigorous
environmental impact assessment before detailed plans are prepared
and submitted for planning permission.

An initial environment evaluation submitted pursuant to subsection (2),
(3)
shall assess the predicted environmental impacts of the proposed development
in sufficient detail to enable the Board to identify any conditions subject to which
approval in principle may be granted and any matters concerning which the Board
shall reserve planning permission until detailed plans have been submitted.

Where the Committee is of the opinion that the available information is
(4)
not adequate for the purposes of conducting an initial environment evaluation,
the Director may require any supplementary preliminary studies and information
that are reasonably necessary for those purposes to be undertaken or collected by
the applicant.

Scoping of environmental impact assessment

In  every  case  where  the  Board  requires  an  environmental  impact
8.(1)
assessment with respect to an application, within 7 days of the date of notification
under regulation 3(5), the Committee shall consider the scope of works necessary
to assess the potential impacts of the proposed development on the environment,
prepare  a  draft  terms  of  reference  for  the  environmental  impact  assessment
required in respect of the proposed development and the Director shall issue the
draft terms of reference to the applicant.

10

(2)
In considering the scope of works to be undertaken for a development listed
in the Sixth Schedule to the Act, the Committee shall take into account the existing
class model for projects of the same class, adopted pursuant to regulation 9, if
any.

(3)
If the applicant wishes to have the draft terms of reference amended, the
applicant shall conduct consultations with any relevant governmental agencies,
non-governmental organisations and members of the public with respect to the
required scope of work for the environmental impact assessment and, within 14
days of the date of issue of the draft terms of reference under sub-regulation (1),
submit to the Director a report on the scoping exercise, inclusive of proposals for
the revision of the draft terms of reference, if any.

The  Committee  shall  consider  any  scoping  report  submitted  by  the
(4)
applicant pursuant to paragraph (2), if any, and issue final terms of reference for
the environmental impact assessment to the applicant within 7 days after the date
of submission of the scoping report or, if the applicant fails to submit a scoping
report, after the expiry of the period allowed by paragraph (3) for the submission
of a scoping report, whichever is earlier in time.

Class Model environmental impact assessment

Where  the  Committee  determines  that  an  environmental  impact
9.(1)
assessment  can  be  used  as  a  basis  for  carrying  out  environmental  impact
assessments for other projects of the same class specified in the Sixth Schedule
to the Act, it may declare the environmental impact statement to be a class model
report.

Any declaration made pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be published in the
(2)
Official Gazette and the environmental impact statement to which it relates shall
be made freely available to the public in electronic form on the Department’s
internet website.

Where a project is within a class in respect of which a class model report
(3)
has  been  declared,  the  Committee  may  permit  the  use  of  that  environmental
impact statement and the environmental impact assessment on which it is based

11

to whatever extent it considers appropriate for the purposes of complying with
the requirements of these Regulations.

Where the Committee permits the use of a class model report, it shall ensure
(4)
that such adjustments are made to the terms of reference of the environmental
impact assessment for the proposed development as are necessary to update the
baseline  environmental  information  and  take  into  account  the  site  specific
circumstances  of  the  development  to  which  the  application  for  planning
permission relates.

Where the Committee determines that an environmental impact statement
(5)
can no longer be used as a class model for carrying out environmental impact
assessments  for  projects  of  the  same  class,  it  may  declare  the  environmental
impact statement not to be a class model.

Any declaration made pursuant to paragraph (5) must be published in the
(6)
Official Gazette and the environmental impact statement to which it relates may
be removed from the internet.

Qualified persons to conduct environmental impact assessment

The applicant shall ensure that the environmental impact assessment
10.(1)
is  carried  out  by  independent  and  suitably  qualified  persons  with  recognised
expertise and experience in the specific areas with respect to which information
and analysis is required by the terms of reference.

The environmental impact statement shall include information outlining
(2)
the  relevant  qualifications  and  experience  of  the  experts  who  carried  out  the
environmental impact assessment.

For the avoidance of doubt, it is declared that the Board, on the advice of
(3)
the Committee, may reject an environmental impact statement on the grounds
that it is not satisfied that the environmental impact assessment to which it relates
has been carried out in accordance with the provisions of this regulation.

12

Public participation in environmental impact assessment

11.(1)
The applicant may be required to provide, during the course of the
environmental impact assessment, an opportunity for the interested members of
the  public  to  meet  with  the  person  carrying  out  the  environmental  impact
assessment on behalf of the applicant in order to

(a)

(b)

provide  information  concerning  the  proposed  development  to  the
persons whose environment may be affected by the development; and

record  the  concerns  of  the  community  regarding  the  potential
environmental impact of the proposed development and to include the
record of such concerns in the environmental impact statement.

The procedure for public contact and involvement with the applicant and
(2)
environmental

environmental impact assessment shall be prescribed by the Committee in the
terms of reference.

impact  assessment  prepared  during

the  course  of

Minimum contents of environmental impact statement

12.(1)

An environmental impact statement shall include at a minimum

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

a description of the proposed development;

a  description  of  the  potentially  affected  environment,  including
specific  information  necessary  for  identifying  and  assessing  the
environmental impacts of the proposed development;

a description of practical alternatives, as appropriate;

an assessment of the likely or potential environmental impacts of the
proposed  development  and  alternatives,  including  direct,  indirect,
cumulative, short-term and long-term impacts;

an identification and description of measures available to mitigate or
offset adverse environmental impacts of the proposed development and
alternatives, and an assessment of those measures;

13

(f)

(g)

an indication of gaps in knowledge and uncertainties which may be
encountered in compiling the required information;

an  indication  of  whether  the  environment  of  any  area  beyond  the
territorial  jurisdiction  of  Barbados  is  likely  to  be  affected  by  the
proposed development or alternatives; and

(h)

a  brief  non-technical  summary  of  the  information  provided  under
subparagraphs (a) to (g).

The environmental impacts in an environmental impacts statement should
(2)
be assessed in a degree of detail commensurate with their likely environmental
significance.

Submission of environmental impact statement

When the environmental impact assessment has been completed, the
13.(1)
applicant  shall  submit  the  environmental  impact  statement  to  the  Director,
accompanied by proof of payment of the applicable fee payable at the review
stage of the environmental impact assessment process.

(2)
The environmental impact statement shall be submitted within 3 years of
the date of the notice given in accordance with regulation 4(5), or such longer
period as may be agreed upon between the applicant and the Director, failing
which the application to which the environmental impact assessment relates may
be cancelled pursuant to section 27(4) of the Act.

Review of environmental impact statement

Within  28  days  after  submission  of  an  environmental  impact
14.(1)
statement, the Committee shall review it to determine whether the environmental
impact assessment substantially complies with the terms of reference and is of a
satisfactory standard.

Where the Committee considers this to be necessary, because expert advice
(2)
is required with respect to any aspect of an environmental impact assessment, the

14

Board  may  engage  an  independent  consultant  to  assist  the  Committee  in
reviewing the environmental impact statement.

Other than in a case to which regulation 15 applies, the Director on the
(3)
advice of the Committee shall notify the applicant that the environmental impact
statement is accepted, subject to its submission for public scrutiny in accordance
with regulation 16.

Procedure where environmental impact statement is deficient

Where  the  Committee  considers  that  the  environmental  impact
15.(1)
statement is deficient in any respect, the Director may require the applicant to
conduct  further  work  and  amend  the  environmental  impact  statement
accordingly.

Where the Committee considers that an environmental impact statement
(2)
is deficient in terms of paragraph (1) and advises the Director to refer it back for
further work, the Director shall indicate in writing to the applicant the nature of
the further work that is required to satisfy the terms of reference.

(3)
Where the Board refers an environmental impact statement back for further
work,  consideration  of  the  application  to  which  the  environmental  impact
assessment relates shall be deferred until after the amended environmental impact
statement is resubmitted by the applicant and the environmental impact statement
has been submitted for public scrutiny in accordance with regulation 16.

Where the Committee refers an environmental impact statement back to
(4)
the applicant for further work and the applicant fails to carry out the further work
which is required to the satisfaction of the Committee, the Committee may reject
the environmental impact statement and the Director may cancel the application
pursuant to section 27(4) of the Act.

15

Public scrutiny of environmental impact statement

16.(1)
When the Committee accepts an environmental impact statement, the
Director shall, in any manner which the Board considers appropriate to facilitate
public access to the report, publish a notice setting out the following information:

(a)

(b)

(c)

the date on which copies of the environmental impact statement will
be available for public scrutiny;

the places at which copies of the environmental impact statement may
be scrutinised; and

the deadline and address for the submission of public comments on the
findings  and  recommendations  of
impact
assessment.

the  environmental

Prior to the deadline set out in the notice published pursuant to paragraph
(2)
(1),  any  person  may  file  written  comments  with  the  Director  relating  to  the
findings and recommendations and any other aspect of the environmental impact
assessment.

The Director shall receive written comments for not less than 21 days and,
(3)
if the Committee determines that there is sufficient public interest in the matter,
the  Director  shall  cause  a  public  consultation  to  be  held  to  receive  verbal
comments on the matter, not later than 7 days after the end of the period allowed
for the submission of written comments.

In determining whether there is sufficient public interest to cause a public
(4)
hearing to be held on the application pursuant to paragraph (3), the Committee
may take into account

(a)

(b)

the number of written comments submitted within the period allowed
for the submission of public comments; and

the amount of public interest in the matter as evidenced by coverage
of the issue in the mass communications media.

16

(5)
Where  any  deficiencies  in  the  environmental  impact  assessment  are
identified as a result of the public scrutiny procedure, the Director may require
the  applicant  to  conduct  further  work  and  amend  the  environmental  impact
statement accordingly, provided always that such work is within the scope of the
terms of reference.

Decision following environmental impact assessment

After taking into consideration the environmental impact statement
17.(1)
and any public comments filed pursuant of regulation 16, the Committee, where
taking  into  account  the  implementation  of  any  mitigation  measures  that  it
considers appropriate,

(a)

(b)

(c)

concludes  that  the  development  is  not  likely  to  cause  significant
adverse  environmental  impacts,  shall  recommend  that  planning
permission  be  granted  subject  to  such  conditions  as  are  required  to
ensure that any adverse impacts of the development on the environment
are reduced and mitigated;

concludes that the development is likely to cause significant adverse
environmental impacts which cannot be offset to its satisfaction, shall
recommend that planning permission for the development be refused;
or

is  uncertain  whether  the  development  is  likely  to  cause  significant
environmental impacts or not, may advise that planning permission be
refused, based on the precautionary principle.

For the avoidance of doubt, it is declared that where the Board takes into
(2)
account the Committee’s conclusions and recommendations with respect to the
environmental  impact  statement  in  determining  an  application  for  planning
permission, the Board is deemed to be in compliance with section 32(8)(e) of the
Act.

Where an application for which an environmental impact assessment is
(3)
required is referred to the Minister for determination pursuant to section 33 of
the  Act,  the  provisions  of  paragraph  (1)  and  (2)  apply,  with  any  necessary

17

modifications, to the determination of the application by the Minister as they
apply to the determination of an application by the Board.

(4)
Where the Board or the Minister grants planning permission following an
environmental  impact  assessment  and  such  permission  is  granted  subject  to
conditions  intended  to  reduce,  mitigate  or  offset  the  adverse  impacts  of  the
development  on  the  environment,  the  Director  shall  make  provision  for
supervising compliance with those conditions and for monitoring the impacts of
the development on the environment after its completion, notwithstanding the
provisions of any other written law.

Made by the Minister this              day of                     , 2021.
