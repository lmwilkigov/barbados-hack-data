TOURISM DEVELOPMENT (AMENDMENT) ACT, 2014

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

The Tourism Development Act, Cap. 341 regulates the very dynamic tourism
industry and it is imperative that this legislative framework is able to respond
rapidly to the dynamism of the industry. The Tourism Development (Amendment)
Act, 2014 amends the Tourism Development Act, Cap. 341 to ensure that it would
be better able to respond to the changing needs of the tourism industry in a timely
manner.

Clause 1:

Clause 2:

Clause 3:

Clause 4:

This clause gives the short title of the amending Act. It may
be cited as Tourism Development (Amendment) Act, 2014.

This clause amends section 2 of the Tourism Development Act,
Cap.  341,  hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  principal  Act,  to
include  a  definition  of  “Authority”  and  to  expand  the
definition of “supplies” in order to improve the efficacy of the
Act.

This clause amends subsections (1) and (3) of section 3 of the
principal Act. It amends subsection (1) to provide for a wider
cross-section of entities to apply to be considered as tourism
products or tourism projects. Further, it amends subsection (3)
to provide for the Minister to declare by order any service,
facility,  company  or  entity  as  a  tourism  project  or  tourism
product.

This clause amends section 15 of the principal Act to provide
greater  flexibility  for  the  granting  of  exemptions  from
customs  duty  in  order  to  facilitate  the  rapid  changes  in  the
industry. Subsection (3) is amended to provide for hotels to
make  an  application  to  the  Minister  where  the  hotel  needs
supplies, items or food or beverages which are not listed in

i

Tourism Development (Amendment) Act,
2014

the  Second  Schedule  and  subsection  (4)  provides  for  the
Minister  to  grant  an  exemption  where  it  contributes  to  the
development  of  the  tourism  project  or  tourism  product  and
will contribute to sustainability and development of tourism
in Barbados. Subsection (5) clarifies the intended use of the
supplies listed in Part VI of the Second Schedule, as it makes
it clear that these supplies are to be used by qualified medical
practitioners who deal with infertility.

This clause amends section 17 to provide for stricter penalties
for  violation  of  section  15  or  the  misuse  of  the  supplies
purchased or imported free of custom duty under the Act.

This clause inserts a new section, section 19A into the Act.
This new section gives the Minister the power to suspend or
revoke the license issued to a tourism project. He may also
suspend the application of the Act for a violation of the Act.

This  clause  deletes  all  references  to  the  former  “Barbados
Tourism Authority” and replaces them with references to the
new “Barbados Tourism Product Authority”.

This  Clause  deletes  a  substantive  provision  inserted  in  the
Tourism  Development  Order,  2013,  as  better  provision  has
been made for the intent of this provision by the insertion of
a subsection (5) in the current amendment of section 15.
