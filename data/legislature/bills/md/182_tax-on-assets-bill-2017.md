of 7 days from the date on which it is filed and registered, the same force and
effect as a judgement of the court in which it is registered in favour of the Crown
against  the  deposit  taking  licensee  or  insurance  company,  named  in  the
certificate, for the amount specified in the certificate and also for

(a)

(b)

interest on that amount at the rate of 1.5 per cent per month calculated
for each month on the unpaid balance of the tax; and

the reasonable costs and charges attendant upon the registration of the
certificate.

All proceedings may be taken on an unpaid tax certificate and the certificate
(4)
may be enforced as if it were a judgement of the court in which it is registered.

Where an unpaid certificate is filed by the Commissioner in the High Court
or in a magistrates’ court for District “A”, the Commissioner shall immediately
deliver  a  copy  of  the  certificate  to  the  deposit  taking  licensee  or  insurance
company to which the certificate relates and if the copy of the certificate is not

shall cease to have effect in respect of the certificate.

Commissioner, in writing, for a refund of the excess,

the  Commissioner  shall  apply  the  amount  of  the  excess  for  meeting  any

this Act and then pay over to the deposit taking licensee or insurance company
the balance, if any.
