EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

SUMMARY

This  Bill  would  on  the  repeal  of  the  Transnational  Organized  Crime  (Prevention  and
Control) Act, 2011, provide for the continuation of the Criminal Assets Recovery Fund
which consists of the proceeds of crime which have been confiscated by order of a court
of law.

The  establishment  of  the  Fund  and  the  rules  governing  the  disposal  of  the  Funds  are
necessary for the purposes of good governance and proper administration. Secondly, the
Bill  implements  Articles  12,  13  and  14  of  the  Convention  Against  Transnational
Organized Crime by providing for a regime of forfeiture and the disposal of the funds so
forfeited. Providing for these matters in a separate Bill recognizes the fact that the Fund
relates to all proceeds of crime and not only to transnational organized crime.

Clause: 5 Administration of Fund
This clause provides that the Fund is to be administered by the Accountant-General.

Clause 7: Insufficient funds
This clause requires any short fall in the Fund to be supplemented from the Consolidated
Fund for the application of the purposes specified in clause 6.

Clause 8: Investment of funds
This clause permits the Attorney-General to invest the resources of the Fund.

Clause 9: Accounts
This  clause  requires  the  Accountant-General  to  keep  proper  records  with  respect  to  the
Fund. It also requires the Auditor-General for the purpose of accountability to audit the
Fund.

Clause 10: Reports
This clause requires the Accountant-General to prepare quarterly reports with respect to
the Fund for submission to the Attorney-General for the purposes of good administration.
It also requires the Attorney-General to lay the reports in Parliament as a matter of record
and for the purposes of transparency.
