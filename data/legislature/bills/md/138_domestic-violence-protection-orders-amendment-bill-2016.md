DOMESTIC VIOLENCE (PROTECTION ORDERS) (AMENDMENT) ACT, 2016

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

The Domestic Violence (Protection Orders) Act, Cap. 130A came into force on
13th February, 1992 to provide for, inter alia, the granting of protection orders in
circumstances surrounding domestic violence. However, certain deficiencies in
the law have become apparent. The amended legislation purports to enhance the
protection offered to victims of domestic violence and ensure that perpetrators
are held accountable. It will, inter alia, provide a comprehensive definition of
the term “domestic violence”, extend the categories of persons considered to be
in a domestic relationship, extend the categories of persons or agencies that may
intervene on behalf of a victim of domestic violence and extend the powers of
the Police Force when dealing with complaints alleging domestic violence.

Clause 1:

states the short title by which the Act may be cited.

Clause 2:

Clause 3:

Clause 4:

replaces the definitions of the terms “child”, “harassment” and
“spouse” used in the principal Act and sets out the definitions
of other terms used in the legislation.

amends  section  3  of  the  principal  Act  to  provide  for  the
circumstances  under  which  the  Court  will  issue  a  final
protection order. Provision is also made for the issuance of an
interim protection order including when such an order may be
issued, the criteria to be met by a complainant before such an
order is issued and how that type of order should be served on
the respondent.

amends section 4 of the principal Act to extend the class of
persons who may apply to the Court for a protection order. It
also provides for the procedure observed by the Court where
an application is made for a protection order, as well as the
options available to the Court in dealing with the application

i

Clause 5:

Clause 6:

Clause 7:

Domestic Violence (Protection Orders)
(Amendment) Act, 2016

when  either  the  complainant  or  his  representative  or  the
respondent failed to appear at the time and place appointed for
hearing.

amends section 5 of the principal Act to state that affidavit
evidence  in  accordance  with  Form  2A  as  set  out  in  the
Schedule,  may  be  given  in  support  of  an  application  for  a
protection order.

amends section 6 of the principal Act to expand the terms that
can be included by the Court when issuing a protection order.
Such  terms  include  making  an  order  for  the  payment  of
compensation for pecuniary loss suffered by a complainant,
payment  for  the  maintenance  of  a  dependant  of  the
complainant and respondent and, where no order is in force
under other legislation, making an order as to the maintenance
of the complainant or a child of the complainant, the custody
of or access to a child of the respondent and the enrolment of
male  perpetrators  of  domestic  violence  in  programmes
facilitated by the Ministry responsible for Social Care. The
Court may also make an order for a respondent to surrender
to the police, any ammunition, firearms or other weapons in
the  respondent’s  control,  whether  or  not  they  were  used  to
commit an act of domestic violence.

amends section 7 of the principal Act to remove the need for
the Court to consider the preservation and protection of the
institution of marriage or a union other than marriage and the
provision of protection and assistance to the family as a natural
and fundamental group unit in society, when determining an
application for a protection order.

Clause 8:

inserts sections 11A to 11E into the principal Act. Section 11A
provides a list of the duties of members of the Police Force

ii

Domestic Violence (Protection Orders)
(Amendment) Act, 2016

when  dealing  with  complaints  alleging  domestic  violence.
They have a duty to respond to every complaint, complete a
report in accordance with Form 6 as set out in the Schedule,
provide  the  complainant  with  a  copy  of  the  report,  render
assistance  to  the  victim,  inform  the  victim  of  the  victim’s
rights, provide a printed copy of those rights and, pursuant to
an emergency protection order or protection order issued by
the Court, seize ammunition, firearms or other weapons in the
control of the person against whom a complaint is made. It
also  states  that  the  Commissioner  of  Police  shall  keep  a
Domestic  Violence  Register  to  record  information  by
members  of  the  Police  Force  who  respond  to  complaints
alleging domestic violence. Section 11B vests in a member of
the Police Force at the rank of Sergeant, the power to issue
emergency protection orders in accordance with Form 8 as set
out in the Schedule, after an arrest is made by a member of
the  Police  Force  upon  reasonable  suspicion  that  an  act  of
domestic violence was committed or is about to be committed.
It  provides  that  the  Sergeant  must  consider  certain  factors
before issuing an emergency protection order, but may issue
such  an  order  without  the  consent  of  the  person  at  risk.
Sections  11C  to  11E  make  provision  for  the  service  of  an
emergency protection order, the responsibility of a perpetrator
after being served with an emergency protection order and the
penalty  for  breaching  an  emergency  protection  order
respectively.

amends  section  12  of  the  principal  Act  to  provide  for  the
power  of  a  member  of  the  Police  Force  to  arrest  without  a
warrant,  a  person  who  is  suspected  to  be  in  breach  of  a
protection order by reason of that person’s use of violence or
unauthorised entry into premises or areas referred to in section
6(1) of the Act. It also confirms that members of the Police

iii

Clause 9:

Clause 10:

Clause 11:

Clause 12:

Clause 13:

Domestic Violence (Protection Orders)
(Amendment) Act, 2016

Force  have  the  power  to  make  an  arrest  on  reasonable
suspicion that an act of domestic violence was committed or
is about to be committed. It states that where the power of
arrest is exercised, the subject of the arrest should be brought
before the Court within 24 hours from the time of his arrest or
as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter.

amends  section  14  of  the  principal  Act  to  provide  for  the
circumstances in which a member of the Police Force may
enter  premises  without  a  warrant  for  the  purpose  of  giving
assistance to any person on those premises. It also provides
that where such a power of entry is exercised, the member of
the Police Force who exercised that power must prepare and
submit a report to the Commissioner of Police.

amends section 16 of the principal Act by deleting subsections
(3) and (4).

inserts  section  19A  into  the  principal  Act.  Section  19A
imposes upon a certain group of individuals, namely, those
who examine or attend to a child (e.g. doctor, psychologist,
teacher) an obligation to report child abuse to the Child Care
Board  or  a  member  of  the  Police  Force  and  provides  the
penalty for a failure to report child abuse or knowingly and
maliciously making a false, inaccurate or misleading report.

amends the Schedule to the principal Act. Form I is a new
Application for Protection Order. Form 2A is the Affidavit in
support of an Application for Protection Order. Form 6 is the
Domestic Violence Police Report. Form 7 lists the Rights of
the Victim. Form 8 is the Emergency Protection Order.
