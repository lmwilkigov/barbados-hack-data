ADDENDUM

  On  the  4th  day  of April,  2019,  the  Cabinet  agreed  to  the  lease  to  The  Maria  Holder

Memorial Trust of a parcel of land known as Grand View situate at Government Hill in the parish

of Saint Michael in this Island containing by admeasurement 5957.1 square metres or thereabouts

for the construction of a nursery school.

  On  the  25th  day  of April,  2019,  the  Cabinet  approved  the  introduction  into  Parliament

of a Resolution seeking approval for the lease.

  By Resolution No. 11/2019 published in the Ofﬁ cial Gazette on the 10th day of June, 2019

Parliament resolved that the parcel of land be leased to The Maria Holder Memorial Trust for a

term of 30 years, subject to terms and conditions which included a lease back to the Crown.

  On  the  22nd  day  of  July,  2021,  the  Cabinet  agreed  to  rescind  its  decisions  of

4th  and  25th April,  2019  and  instead  agreed  to  lease  to  The  Maria  Holder  Memorial  Trust

the parcel of land situate at Government Hill in the parish of Saint Michael subject to terms

and conditions which include the grant of a licence to the Crown.

The approval of Parliament is therefore now sought for the rescission of the Resolution

passed in the House of Assembly on the 30th day of April, 2019 and in the Senate on the 31st day

of May, 2019 and assented to by the Governor-General on the 5th day of June, 2019 and published

in the Ofﬁ cial Gazette as Resolution No. 11/2019.
