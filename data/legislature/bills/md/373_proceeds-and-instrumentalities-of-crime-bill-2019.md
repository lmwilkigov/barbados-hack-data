a gift.

Where subsection (1) applies, the property given shall be treated as such

(2)
share in the property transferred as is represented by the fraction

transfer.

Tainted gifts

Where the Court determines that section 16 applies to a defendant or

(i)

(ii)

which  was  obtained  by  the  defendant  as  a  result  of,  or  in

(2)
the period of 6 years ending with

where  there  are  2  or  more  offences  and  proceedings  for  them  were
instituted against the defendant on different days, the earliest of those
days.

Where the Court determines that section 16 does not apply to a defendant,

(3)
a gift is tainted where it was made by the defendant at any time after

(a)

(b)

the date on which the offence concerned was committed; or

where his particular criminal conduct consists of 2 or more offences
and they were committed on different dates, the date of the earliest
offence.

(4)

For the purposes of subsection (3)

(a)

(b)

an  offence  which  is  a  continuing  offence  is  committed  on  the  first
occasion when it is committed; and

the  defendant’s  particular  conduct  includes  any  conduct  which

(5)
commencement date.

(6)
defendant has made the gift.

specified in this subsection is any property which directly or indirectly
represents, in his hands, the property given;

where  the  recipient  holds  part  of  the  property  given,  the  property
specified in this subsection is that part and any property which directly
or  indirectly  represents,  in  his  hands,  the  other  part  of  the  property
given.

General and particular criminal conduct

General criminal conduct, with respect to a defendant, means all his
11.(1)
criminal conduct and for the purposes of this definition, it is immaterial whether
the conduct occurred, or property constituting a benefit from the conduct was
obtained, before or after the commencement date.

(2)
criminal conduct which constitutes

to have been instituted at the earliest of those times.

(3)

Proceedings for an offence are concluded

(b)

(c)

(d)

is set aside or the defendant is pardoned before a confiscation order is
made, when the conviction is set aside or the defendant is pardoned;

where  a  confiscation  order  is  made  against  the  defendant  in  the
proceedings, when the order is satisfied or discharged or when the order
is set aside and the decision to set aside the order is no longer subject
to appeal;

where the defendant is convicted on one or more counts or charges but
the Court decides not to make a confiscation order against him, when
the Court’s decision is no longer subject to appeal by the prosecutor;

where the defendant is sentenced without the Court having considered
whether  or  not  to  proceed  under  section  24  in  his  case,  when  he  is
sentenced.

(4)

An application under section 29, 30, 31, 32, 37 or 38 is concluded where

(a)

(b)

the Court decides not to make or vary, as the case may be, any order
against the defendant on the application, when it makes the decision;

an order against the defendant is made or varied on the application,
when the order is

(i)

satisfied or discharged; or

29

(ii)

set aside and the decision to set the order aside is no longer subject
to appeal; and

(c)

the application is withdrawn, when the prosecutor notifies the Court of
the withdrawal of the application.

(5)

A confiscation order is satisfied when no amount is due under it.

An order is subject to appeal until, disregarding any power of a court to
(6)
grant leave to appeal out of time, there is no further possibility of an appeal on
which the order could be varied or set aside.

Application for confiscation order or forfeiture order on conviction

13.(1)

Where a defendant is

(a)

(b)

convicted by the Court of an offence or offences; or

committed  to  the  Court  by  a  magistrate  in  respect  of  an  offence  or
offences under section 68,

the Court may, on the application of the prosecutor or on its own motion, make
all or any of the orders specified in subsection (2).

(2)

The orders referred to in subsection (1) are:

(a)

(b)

(c)

an order confiscating any benefit that the defendant obtained as a result
of, or in connection with, the commission of the offence or offences;

an order forfeiting any property that is an instrumentality of the offence
or offences;

an order forfeiting any property that the defendant obtained as a result
of, or in connection with, the commission of the offence or offences,
including any tainted gift.

Where  an  application  is  made  to  the  Court  for  an  order  referred  to  in
(3)
subsection (2) in respect of a person’s conviction of an offence, the Court may,
in determining the application, have regard to the transcript of any proceedings
against the person for the offence.

30

(4)
Where an application is made for an order referred to in subsection (2) and
the Court has not, when the application is made, passed sentence on the person
for the offence, the Court may, where it is satisfied that it is reasonable to do so
in  all  the  circumstances,  defer  passing  sentence  until  it  has  determined  the
application for the order.

Division 2

Confiscation Orders

Application for confiscation order

Where the prosecutor intends to apply to the Court for a confiscation
14.(1)
order or the Court on its own motion determines that it is appropriate to proceed
under section 15 against a defendant

(a)

(b)

the prosecutor shall give the defendant no less than 14 days’ written
notice of the application; and

the defendant may appear and adduce evidence at the hearing of the
application.

The prosecutor may, before the final determination of an application for a
(2)
confiscation order, apply to the Court to amend the application to include any
other property, and the Court may so amend the application where it is satisfied
that

(a)

(b)

the  property  was  not  reasonably  capable  of  identification  when  the
application was originally made; or

necessary  evidence  became  available  only  after  the  application  was
originally made.

Where  the  prosecutor  intends  to  apply  to  amend  an  application  for  a
(3)
confiscation order against a defendant and the effect of the amendment would be
to include an additional benefit in the application for the confiscation order the

31

prosecutor shall give the defendant no less than 14 days’ written notice of the
application to amend.

Making of confiscation order

15.(1)
Where the prosecutor applies to the Court for a confiscation order or
the Court on its own motion determines that it is appropriate to proceed under
this  section,  the  Court  shall  determine  whether  section  16  applies  in  the
defendant’s case, and where it determines that section 16

(a)

(b)

applies, whether the defendant has benefited from his general criminal
conduct; or

does not apply, whether the defendant has benefited from his particular
criminal conduct.

Where  the  Court  determines  in  accordance  with  subsection  (1)  that  a
(2)
defendant has benefited from his general or particular criminal conduct, the Court
shall

(a)

determine  the  amount  to  be  recovered  from  him  (the  “recoverable
amount”) in accordance with section 17; and

(b)

make a confiscation order requiring him to pay that amount.

Where the Court is satisfied that any victim of the defendant’s criminal
(3)
conduct  has  instituted,  or  intends  to  institute,  civil  proceedings  against  the
defendant in respect of any loss, injury or damage sustained in connection with
the defendant’s conduct

(a)

(b)

the Court shall treat the duty in subsection (2) as a power; and

the recoverable amount is such amount as the Court considers just, but
the recoverable amount shall not exceed the amount that it would have
been if this subsection did not apply.

The Court shall determine any question arising under subsection (1) or (2)

(4)
on a balance of probabilities.

32

The Court may postpone the proceedings for a confiscation order under

(5)
the procedure set out in section 24.

(6)
Unless the Court postpones the proceedings for confiscation under section
24,  it  shall  proceed  under  this  section  before  sentencing  the  defendant  with
respect to the offence or offences referred to in section 13(1).

Application of section 16

16.(1)

This section applies to a defendant who is convicted of

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

a drug trafficking offence;

a money laundering offence;

an offence that constitutes conduct forming part of a course of criminal
activity within the meaning of subsection (2); or

an  offence  committed  over  a  period  of  at  least  6  months  and  has
benefited from the conduct which constitutes the offence.

For the purposes of subsection (1)(c), conduct forms part of a course of

(2)
criminal activity where the defendant benefited from the conduct and

(a)

(b)

in the proceedings in which he was convicted of an offence in relation
to the conduct, he was also convicted of at least one other qualifying
offence; or

he was convicted on at least one previous occasion in the period of 6
years prior to the commencement of the proceedings of at least one
qualifying offence.

Subsection (1)(b) and (c) do not apply to a defendant where the value of
(3)
the relevant benefit obtained is less than $10 000 or such other amount as may
be prescribed by the Minister by Order subject to negative Resolution.

(4)

In this section

“qualifying offence” means an offence which constitutes conduct from which the

defendant has benefited;

“relevant benefit” means the total benefit from

33

(a)

(b)

all offences comprising the course of criminal activity; and

conduct which constitutes an offence which has been or will be taken
into  consideration  by  the  Court  in  sentencing  the  defendant  for  any
offence specified in paragraph (a).

Recoverable amount

17.(1)
Subject to this subsections (2) to (6), the recoverable amount for the
purposes of section 15(2)(a) is an amount equal to the defendant’s benefit from
the conduct concerned.

Subsection (3) applies where the defendant proves that the value of the
(2)
benefit under subsection (1) is greater than the amount available to him, being
the aggregate of the total of the values, at the time the confiscation order is made,
of

(a)

all  the  realisable  property  then  held  by  the  defendant  less  the  total
amount payable pursuant to obligations which then have priority; and

(b)

all tainted gifts.

In the circumstances referred to in subsection (2), the recoverable amount

(3)
is

(a)

the amount the defendant proves is available to him in accordance with
that subsection; or

(b)

a nominal amount, where the amount referred to in paragraph (a) is nil.

For the purposes of subsection (2), an obligation has priority where it is an

(4)
obligation of the defendant to pay

(a)

an amount due in respect of a fine or other order of a court which was
imposed or made on conviction of an offence and at any time before
the time the confiscation order is made; or

34

(b)

a sum which would be included among the preferential debts of the
defendant if the defendant’s bankruptcy or, in the case of a company,
its liquidation, had commenced on the date of the confiscation order.

(5)
In subsection (4), “preferential debt” means a debt that, in the bankruptcy
of an individual or the liquidation of a company, is payable in priority to the debts
of other creditors.

In calculating the defendant’s benefit from the conduct concerned for the
(6)
purposes of subsection (1), any property in respect of which a recovery order, a
cash forfeiture order, a listed asset forfeiture order or a forfeiture order is in force
shall be ignored.

Defendant’s benefit

In determining, for the purposes of section 15, whether a defendant
18.(1)
has benefited from conduct, and, if so, his benefit from that conduct, the Court
shall take account of

(a)

(b)

conduct occurring up to the time it makes its determination; and

property obtained up to that time.

Subsections (3) to (5) apply where the conduct concerned, for the purposes

(2)
of section 15, is the defendant’s general criminal conduct.

Where a confiscation order has previously been made against the defendant
(3)
under this Act or any other enactment, and his benefit for the purposes of that
order was his benefit from his general criminal conduct

(a)

(b)

his benefit determined at the time the last confiscation order was made
against him shall be taken for the purposes of this section to be his
benefit from his general criminal conduct at that time; and

the Court shall deduct the aggregate of the amounts ordered to be paid
under each confiscation order previously made against the defendant
under

(i)

this Act; and

35

(ii)

any other enactment.

(4)
Subsection (3)(b) does not apply to an amount which has been taken into
account  for  the  purposes  of  a  deduction  under  that  subsection  on  any  earlier
occasion.

The  reference  to  general  criminal  conduct  in  the  case  of  a  confiscation
(5)
order made under any other enactment is a reference to conduct in respect of
which a court is required or entitled to make one or more assumptions for the
purpose of assessing a person’s benefit from the conduct.

Assumptions to be made where section 16 applies

Subject to subsection (3), where the Court determines under section
19.(1)
15(1)  that  section  16  applies  to  the  defendant,  the  Court  shall  make  the
assumptions specified in subsection (2) for the purposes of determining

(a)

whether the defendant has benefited from his general criminal conduct;
and

(b)

his benefit from the conduct.

(2)

The assumptions referred to in subsection (1) are that

(a)

any property transferred to the defendant at any time after the relevant
date was obtained by him

(i)

as a result of his general criminal conduct; and

(ii)

at the earliest time he appears to have held it;

(b)

any  property  held  by  the  defendant  at  any  time  after  the  date  of
conviction was obtained by him

(i)

as a result of his general criminal conduct; and

(ii)

at the earliest time he appears to have held it;

(c)

any expenditure incurred by the defendant at any time after the relevant
date was met from property obtained by him as a result of his general
criminal conduct; and

36

(d)

for the purpose of valuing any property obtained, or assumed to have
been obtained, by the defendant, he obtained the property free of any
other interests in it.

The Court shall not make an assumption under subsection (1) in relation

(3)
to particular property or expenditure where

(a)

(b)

the assumption is shown to be incorrect; or

there would be a serious risk of injustice if the assumption were made.

Where  the  Court  does  not  make  one  or  more  of  the  assumptions  under

(4)
subsection (1), the Court shall state its reasons.

For the purposes of this section, “the relevant date” is the first day of the

(5)
period of 6 years ending with

(a)

(b)

the date when proceedings for the offence concerned were instituted
against the defendant; or

where  there  are  2  or  more  offences  and  proceedings  for  them  were
instituted on different days, the earliest of those days.

Where a confiscation order has been made against the defendant under this
(6)
Act or any other enactment at any time during the period referred to in subsection
(5)

(a)

(b)

the relevant date is the date when the defendant’s benefit was calculated
for the purposes of the last such confiscation order;

the  assumption  specified  in  subsection  (2)(b)  does  not  apply  to  any
property which was held by him on or before the relevant date.

Time for payment under confiscation order

20.(1)
a confiscation order shall be paid on the making of the order.

Subject to subsections (2) to (5), the amount ordered to be paid under

37

(2)
Where the defendant shows that he needs time to pay the amount ordered
to be paid, the Court may make an order allowing payment to be made within a
period not exceeding 6 months after the date of the confiscation order.

(3)
Where, on the application of the defendant, the Court is satisfied that there
are  exceptional  circumstances,  the  Court  may  extend  the  period  specified  in
subsection (2).

An order under subsection (3) may be made after the end of the period
(4)
originally given for payment but shall not be made after the end of the period of
12 months starting with the date on which the confiscation order was made.

The Court shall not make an order under subsection (2) or (3) unless it

(5)
gives the prosecutor an opportunity to make representations to the Court.

This section and sections 21 and 23 apply where an external order for the
(6)
recovery of a specified sum of money is registered in Barbados subject to the
following modifications:

(a)

(b)

a reference to a confiscation order shall be treated as a reference to the
external order; and

a reference to the date of the confiscation order shall be treated as a
reference to the date that notice of the registration of the order is given
to the person affected by it.

Interest on sums unpaid under confiscation order

21.(1)
Where the amount required to be paid by a person under a confiscation
order is not paid when it is required to be paid, the person shall pay interest on
the amount unpaid for the period for which it remains unpaid at the rate for the
time being applicable to a civil judgment debt.

For the purposes of subsection (1), no amount is required to be paid under

(2)
a confiscation order where

(a)

(b)

an application has been made under section 20(3);

the application has not been determined by the Court; and

38

(c)

the period of 12 months starting with the date on which the confiscation
order was made has not ended.

The amount of interest payable under this section shall be treated as part

(3)
of the amount to be paid under the confiscation order.

Effect of confiscation order on Court’s other powers

Where the Court makes a confiscation order against a defendant, it
22.(1)
shall, in respect of any offence of which he is convicted in those proceedings,
take account of the confiscation order before

(a)

(b)

(c)

imposing a fine on him;

making  any  order  involving  any  payment  by  him,  other  than  a
compensation order; or

making any other order for confiscation, compensation or forfeiture
under this Act or any other enactment.

Subject to subsection (1), the Court shall leave the confiscation order out

(2)
of account in deciding the appropriate sentence for the defendant.

(3)

The Court shall make an order under subsection (4) where it

(a)

(b)

makes a confiscation order and a compensation order against the same
person in the same proceedings; and

believes that the person will not have sufficient means to satisfy both
orders in full.

Where subsection (3) applies, the Court shall order that such amount of the
(4)
compensation  order  that  it  believes  will  not  be  recoverable  because  of  the
insufficiency of the person’s means, be paid out of any sums recovered under the
confiscation order.

Court may order payment by financial institution

23.(1)
maintained by the person with a financial institution.

This section applies to money which is held by a person in an account

39

(2)

This section applies where the following conditions are satisfied:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

a restraining order has effect in relation to money to which this section
applies;

a confiscation order is made against the person by whom the money is
held;

an enforcement receiver has not been appointed; and

any period allowed under section 20 for payment of the amount ordered
to be paid under the confiscation order has ended.

Where subsection (2) applies, the Court may order the financial institution
(3)
to  pay  the  money  to  the  Court  on  account  of  the  amount  payable  under  the
confiscation order.

A financial institution that fails to comply with an order under subsection
(4)
(3) is guilty of an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine of $50,000.

(5)

For the purposes of this section, “financial institution” means

(a)

(b)

(c)

a commercial bank, trust company, finance company, merchant bank
and brokerage house or other deposit-taking institution;

a society registered under the Co-operative Societies Act, Cap. 378A;
and

a  building  society  registered  under  the  Building  Societies  Act,
Cap. 377.

Postponement of confiscation proceedings

24.(1)

Where the Court considers it appropriate to do so, the Court may

(a)

(b)

postpone  proceedings  under  section  15  for  a  specified  period  (“the
postponement period”); and

extend the postponement period for a specified period on one or more
occasions.

40

(2)
Unless the Court is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances, the
postponement  period,  whether  as  originally  ordered  or  as  extended,  shall  not
exceed a period of 2 years from the date of the conviction of the defendant.

Where the defendant appeals against his conviction, the Court may, on that

(3)
account

(a)

(b)

defer  making  any  determination  as  to  postponement  mentioned  in
subsection (1) for such period as it may specify; or

where it has already exercised its powers under this section to postpone,
extend the postponement period.

Unless the Court is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances, any
(4)
postponement or extension under subsection (3), shall not exceed a period of 3
months from the date on which the appeal is determined or otherwise disposed
of.

(5)

A postponement or extension under subsection (1) or (3) may be made

(a)

(b)

on the application of the defendant or the prosecutor; or

by the Court of its own motion.

An application to extend the postponement period may be granted after the
(6)
postponement period has ended, provided that the application is made before it
ends.

Effect of postponement

25.(1)
Subject  to  subsection  (2),  where  the  Court  exercises  its  power  to
postpone proceedings under section 24, it may nevertheless proceed to sentence
a defendant in respect of the offence or any of the offences concerned.

In sentencing the defendant in respect of the offence, or any of the offences,

(2)
concerned during the postponement period, the Court shall not

(a)

impose a fine on him;

41

(b)

(c)

make  any  order  involving  any  payment  by  him,  other  than  a
compensation order; or

make  any  other  order  for  confiscation,  compensation  or  forfeiture
under this Act or any other enactment.

Subject  to  subsection  (4),  where  the  Court  has  sentenced  the  defendant
(3)
under subsection (1) during the postponement period, the Court may, after the
end of that period, vary the sentence by

(a)

(b)

(c)

imposing a fine on him;

making  any  order  involving  any  payment  by  him,  including  a
compensation order; or

making any other order for confiscation, compensation or forfeiture
under this Act or any other enactment.

The Court may proceed under subsection (3) only within the period of 28

(4)
days commencing on the last day of the postponement period.

Where the Court proceeds to sentence the defendant under subsection (1),
(5)
section 15 has effect as if the defendant’s particular criminal conduct included
conduct which constitutes offences which the Court has taken into consideration
in deciding his sentence for the offence or offences concerned.

Statement of information

26.(1)
the period ordered by the Court where

The prosecutor shall give the Court a statement of information within

(a)

(b)

the prosecutor applies for a confiscation order; or

the Court on its own motion determines that it is appropriate to proceed
under section 15 and orders the prosecutor to give the statement.

42

(2)
Where  the  prosecutor  believes  that  section  16  applies  with  respect  to  a
defendant, the statement of information is a statement of matters the prosecutor
believes are relevant in connection with deciding

(a)

(b)

whether section 16 applies to the defendant;

whether the defendant has benefited from his general criminal conduct;
and

(c)

his benefit from the conduct.

A statement under subsection (2) shall include information the prosecutor

(3)
believes is relevant

(a)

(b)

in connection with the making by the Court of an assumption under
section 19; and

for  the  purpose  of  enabling  the  Court  to  determine  whether  the
circumstances are such that it shall not make such an assumption.

Where  the  prosecutor  does  not  believe  that  section  16  applies  to  a
(4)
defendant, the statement of information is a statement of matters the prosecutor
believes are relevant in connection with deciding

(a)

whether  the  defendant  has  benefited  from  his  particular  criminal
conduct; and

(b)

his benefit from the conduct.

Where  the  prosecutor  gives  the  Court  a  statement  of  information,  the

(5)
prosecutor

(a)

(b)

may at any time give the Court a further statement of information; and

shall give the Court a further statement of information where it orders
him to do so, within the period ordered by the Court.

(6)

The Court may, at any time, vary an order made under this section.

43

Defendant’s response to statement of information

27.(1)
a copy is served on the defendant, the Court may order the defendant

Where the prosecutor gives the Court a statement of information and

(a)

(b)

to indicate, within the period it orders, the extent to which he accepts
each allegation in the statement; and

so far as he does not accept such an allegation, to give particulars of
any matters he proposes to rely on.

Where the defendant accepts to any extent an allegation in a statement of
(2)
information, the Court may treat his acceptance as conclusive of the matters to
which  it  relates  for  the  purpose  of  deciding  the  issues  referred  to  in  section
26(2) or (4), as the case may be.

Where the defendant fails in any respect to comply with an order under
(3)
subsection (1), he may be treated for the purposes of subsection (2) as accepting
every allegation in the statement of information apart from an allegation

(a)

in respect of which he has complied with the requirement of the order;
and

(b)

that he has benefited from his general or particular criminal conduct.

For  the  purposes  of  this  section,  an  allegation  may  be  accepted  or

(4)
particulars may be given in a manner ordered by the Court.

(5)

The Court may, at any time, vary an order made under this section.

No acceptance under this section that the defendant has benefited from

(6)
conduct is admissible in evidence in proceedings for an offence.

Provision of information by defendant

28.(1)
The Court may, at any time, for the purpose of obtaining information
to help the Court in carrying out its functions under this Act, order a defendant
to provide it with such information as may be specified in the order.

44

An  order  under  this  section  may  require  all  or  a  specified  part  of  the

(2)
information to be given in a specified manner and before a specified date.

(3)
Where the defendant fails without reasonable excuse to comply with an
order  under  this  section  the  Court  may  draw  such  inference  as  it  believes  is
appropriate.

Subsection  (3)  does  not  affect  any  power  of  the  Court  to  deal  with  the

(4)
defendant in respect of a failure to comply with an order under this section.

Where  the  prosecutor  accepts  to  any  extent  an  allegation  made  by  the

(5)
defendant

(a)

(b)

in giving information required by an order under this section; or

in  any  other  statement  given  to  the  Court  in  relation  to  any  matter
relevant to determining the amount available to him for the purposes
of section 17,

the Court may treat the acceptance as conclusive of the matters to which it relates.

For the purposes of this section an allegation may be accepted in a manner

(6)
ordered by the Court.

(7)

The Court may, at any time, vary an order made under this section.

No information given under this section which amounts to an admission
(8)
by  a  defendant  that  he  has  benefited  from  criminal  conduct  is  admissible  in
evidence in proceedings for an offence.

Reconsideration of case where no confiscation order made

29.(1)

This section applies where

(a)

(b)

section 13(1) applies in respect of a defendant, but the Court has not
proceeded under section 15;

there  is  evidence  which  was  not  available  to  the  prosecutor  on  the
relevant date;

45

(c)

before  the  end  of  the  period  of  6  years  starting  with  the  date  of
conviction, the prosecutor applies to the Court to consider the evidence;
and

(d)

after considering the evidence the Court believes it is appropriate for
it to proceed under section 15.

Where subsection (1) applies, the Court shall proceed under section 15 and

(2)
subsections (3) to (8) apply for the purpose.

Where the Court has already sentenced the defendant for the offence (or
(3)
any of the offences) concerned, section 15 has effect as if his particular criminal
conduct included conduct which constitutes offences which the Court has taken
into consideration in deciding his sentence for the offence or offences concerned.

The Court shall, instead of taking account of the matters specified in section

(4)
18(1)(a) and (b), take account of

(a)

(b)

(c)

conduct occurring before the relevant date;

property obtained before the relevant date; and

property obtained on or after the relevant date where it was obtained
as  a  result  of,  or  in  connection  with,  conduct  occurring  before  the
relevant date.

(5)

For the purposes of this section

(a)

(b)

(c)

the assumptions specified in section 19(2)(a)and (b) do not apply with
regard to property first held by the defendant on or after the relevant
date;

the assumption specified in section 19(2)(c) does not apply with regard
to expenditure incurred by the defendant on or after the relevant date;
and

the assumption specified in section 19(2)(d) does not apply with regard
to  property  obtained,  or  assumed  to  have  been  obtained,  by  the
defendant on or after the relevant date.

46

(6)
The recoverable amount for the purposes of section 15 is such amount, not
exceeding the amount determined in accordance with section 17, as the Court
considers just.

(7)

In arriving at the just amount the Court shall have regard in particular to

(a)

(b)

(c)

the recoverable amount determined in accordance with section 17;

any fine imposed on the defendant in respect of the offence or any of
the offences concerned;

any order within section 22(1)(b) or (c) that has been made against the
defendant in respect of the offence, or any of the offences, concerned
and has not already been taken into account by the Court in determining
what is the realisable property held by him for the purposes of section
17; and

(d)

any compensation order that has been made against the defendant in
respect of the offence, or any of the offences, concerned.

Where  a  compensation  order  has  been  made  against  the  defendant  in
(8)
respect of the offence or offences concerned section 22(3) and (4) do not apply.

(9)

For the purposes of this section, “the relevant date” is, where the Court

(a)

made  a  decision  not  to  proceed  under  section  15,  the  date  of  the
decision; or

(b)

did not make such a decision, the date of conviction.

Reconsideration of benefit where no confiscation order made

30.(1)

This section applies where

(a)

in proceeding under section 15, the Court has determined that

(i)

(ii)

section 16 applies to the defendant but he has not benefited from
his general criminal conduct; or

section 16 does not apply to the defendant and he has not benefited
from his particular criminal conduct;

47

(b)

(c)

(d)

there is evidence which was not available to the prosecutor when the
Court determined that the defendant had not benefited from his general
or particular criminal conduct;

before  the  end  of  the  period  of  6  years  starting  with  the  date  of
conviction the prosecutor applies to the Court to consider the evidence;
and

after considering the evidence, the Court concludes that it would have
determined  that  the  defendant  had  benefited  from  his  general  or
particular criminal conduct, as the case may be, if the evidence had
been available to it.

(2)

Where this section applies, the Court

(a)

shall make a fresh determination under section 15(1)(a) or (b) as to
whether  the  defendant  has  benefited  from  his  general  or  particular
criminal conduct, as the case may be; and

(b)

may make a confiscation order under section 15.

Subsections (4) to (8) apply where the Court proceeds under section 15

(3)
pursuant to this section.

Where the Court has already sentenced the defendant for the offence, or
(4)
any of the offences concerned, section 15 has effect as if the defendant’s particular
criminal conduct included conduct which constitutes offences which the Court
has taken into consideration in deciding his sentence for the offence or offences
concerned.

The Court shall, instead of taking account of the matters specified in section

(5)
18(1)(a) and (b), take account of

(a)

conduct  occurring  before  the  date  of  the  original  decision  that  the
defendant  had  not  benefited  from  his  general  or  particular  criminal
conduct;

(b)

property obtained before that date; and

48

(c)

property obtained on or after that date where it was obtained as a result
of, or in connection with, conduct occurring before that date.

(6)

For the purposes of this section

(a)

(b)

(c)

the assumptions specified in section 19(2)(a) and (b) do not apply with
regard to property first held by the defendant on or after the date of the
original decision that the defendant had not benefited from his general
or particular criminal conduct;

the assumption specified in  section 19(2)(c) does not apply with regard
to expenditure incurred by him on or after that date; and

the assumption specified in  section 19(2)(d) does not apply with regard
to property obtained, or assumed to have been obtained, by him on or
after that date.

The recoverable amount for the purposes of section 17 is such amount as
(7)
the Court considers just, but that amount shall not exceed the amount that the
recoverable amount would have been under section 17 if this subsection did not
apply.

(8)

In arriving at the just amount the Court shall have regard in particular to

(a)

(b)

(c)

the recoverable amount determined in accordance with section 17;

any fine imposed on the defendant in respect of the offence, or any of
the offences, concerned;

any order within section 22(1)(b) or (c) that has been made against him
in respect of the offence, or any of the offences, concerned and has not
already been taken into account by the Court in determining what is
the realisable property held by him for the purposes of section 17; and

(d)

any compensation order that has been made against him.

49

Reconsideration of benefit where confiscation order made

31.(1)

This section applies where

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

the Court has made a confiscation order;

there  is  evidence  which  was  not  available  to  the  prosecutor  at  the
relevant time;

the prosecutor believes that if the Court were to determine the amount
of the defendant’s benefit pursuant to this section it would exceed the
relevant amount;

before  the  end  of  the  period  of  6  years  starting  with  the  date  of
conviction the prosecutor applies to the Court to consider the evidence;
and

(e)

after considering the evidence the Court believes it is appropriate for
it to proceed under this section.

Where this section applies, the Court shall make a new calculation of the
(2)
defendant’s benefit from the conduct concerned, and subsections (3) to (11) apply
for this purpose.

Where the Court has already sentenced the defendant for the offence, or
(3)
any of the offences concerned, section 15 has effect as if his particular criminal
conduct included conduct which constitutes offences which the Court has taken
into consideration in deciding his sentence for the offence or offences concerned.

The Court shall, instead of taking account of the matters specified in section

(4)
18(1)(a) and (b), take account of

(a)

conduct occurring up to the time it determined the defendant’s benefit
for the purposes of the confiscation order;

(b)

property obtained up to that time; and

(c)

property obtained after that time where it was obtained as a result of,
or in connection with, conduct occurring before that time.

50

(5)

(6)

In applying section 18(3)(b), the confiscation order shall be ignored.

For the purposes of this section

(a)

(b)

(c)

the assumptions specified in section 19(2)(a) and (b) do not apply with
regard to property first held by the defendant after the time the Court
determined his benefit for the purposes of the confiscation order;

the assumption specified in section 19(2)(c) does not apply with regard
to expenditure incurred by him after that time; and

the assumption specified in section 19(2)(d) does not apply with regard
to property obtained, or assumed to have been obtained, by him after
that time.

Where the amount determined under the new calculation of the defendant’s

(7)
benefit exceeds the relevant amount, the Court

(a)

(b)

shall  make  a  new  calculation  of  the  recoverable  amount  for  the
purposes of section 15; and

where it exceeds the amount required to be paid under the confiscation
order, may vary the order by substituting for the amount required to be
paid, such amount as it believes is just.

(8)

In applying subsection (7)(a) the Court shall

(a)

(b)

take the new calculation of the defendant’s benefit; and

apply section 17 as if references to the time the confiscation order is
made were to the time of the new calculation of the recoverable amount
and as if references to the date of the confiscation order were to the
date of that new calculation.

(9)

In applying subsection (7)(b) the Court

(a)

shall have regard in particular to

(i)

any fine imposed on the defendant for the offence, or any of the
offences, concerned;

51

(ii)

any  order  within  section  22(1)(b)  or  (c)  that  has  been  made
against  the  defendant  in  respect  of  the  offence,  or  any  of  the
offences, concerned and has not already been taken into account
by the Court in determining what is the realisable property held
by him for the purposes of section 17; and

(iii)

any compensation order that has been made against the defendant
in respect of the offence, or any of the offences, concerned; but

(b)

shall not have regard to an order falling within paragraph (a)(iii) where
an order has been made under section 22(4).

In determining under this section whether one amount exceeds another, the

(10)
Court shall take account of any change in the value of money.

(11)

For the purposes of this section,

“the relevant time” is

(a)

when the Court calculated the defendant’s benefit for the purposes of
the confiscation order, where this section has not applied previously;
or

(b)

when the Court last calculated the defendant’s benefit pursuant to this
section, where this section has applied previously;

“the relevant amount” is

(a)

the amount determined as the defendant’s benefit for the purposes of
the confiscation order, where this section has not applied previously;
or

(b)

the amount last determined as the defendant’s benefit pursuant to this
section, where this section has applied previously.

52

Reconsideration of amount available to defendant where confiscation
order made

32.(1)

This section applies where

(a)

(b)

(c)

the Court has made a confiscation order;

the  amount  required  to  be  paid  was  the  amount  determined  in
accordance with section 17(3); and

the prosecutor or an enforcement receiver appointed in relation to the
order applies to the Court to make a new calculation of the amount
available to the defendant.

Where this section applies, the Court shall make the new calculation and,
(2)
in doing so, it shall apply section 17 as if references to the time the confiscation
order is made were to the time of the new calculation and as if references to the
date of the confiscation order were to the date of the new calculation.

Where  the  amount  determined  under  the  new  calculation  exceeds  the
(3)
relevant amount, the Court may vary the order by substituting for the amount
required to be paid such amount as the Court considers just, but that amount shall
not exceed the amount determined as the defendant’s benefit from the conduct
concerned.

(4)

In deciding what is just the Court

(a)

shall have regard, in particular to

(i)

(ii)

any fine imposed on the defendant for the offence, or any of the
offences, concerned;

any  order  within  section  22(1)(b)  or  (c)  that  has  been  made
against  the  defendant  in  respect  of  the  offence,  or  any  of  the
offences, concerned and has not already been taken into account
by the Court in determining what is the realisable property held
by him for the purposes of section 17; and

53

(iii)

any compensation order that has been made against him in respect
of the offence, or any of the offences, concerned; but

(b)

shall not have regard to an order falling within paragraph (a)(iii) where
an order has been made under section 22(4).

In determining under this section whether one amount exceeds another, the

(5)
Court shall take account of any change in the value of money.

(6)

In this section (3), “the relevant amount” is

(a)

the amount determined as the amount available to the defendant for the
purposes of the confiscation order, where this section has not applied
previously; or

(b)

the amount last determined as the amount available to the defendant
pursuant to this section, where this section has applied previously.

In this section, the amount determined as the defendant’s benefit from the

(7)
conduct concerned is

(a)

(b)

the amount determined when the confiscation order was made; or

where one or more new calculations of the defendant’s benefit have
been made under section 31 the amount determined on the occasion of
the last such calculation.

Variation of order where amount available to defendant is inadequate

33.(1)

This section applies where

(a)

(b)

the Court has made a confiscation order; and

the defendant, the prosecutor or an enforcement receiver appointed in
relation to the order applies to the Court to vary the order under this
section.

Where this section applies, the Court shall calculate the amount available
(2)
to the defendant and, in doing so, it shall apply section 17 as if references to the

54

time the confiscation order is made were to the time of the calculation and as if
references to the date of the confiscation order were to the date of the calculation.

Where the Court determines that the amount available to the defendant
(3)
calculated in accordance with subsection (2) is inadequate for the payment of any
amount remaining to be paid under the confiscation order, the Court may vary
the order by substituting for the amount required to be paid, such smaller amount
as it considers just.

Where  a  person  has  been  adjudged  bankrupt  or  his  estate  has  been
(4)
sequestrated, or where an order for the liquidation of a company has been made,
the Court shall take into account the extent to which realisable property held by
the person or company may be distributed among creditors.

The Court may disregard any inadequacy which it believes is attributable,
(5)
wholly or partly, to anything done by the defendant for the purpose of preserving
property held by the recipient of a tainted gift from any risk of realisation under
this Act.

Discharge of order for inadequacy of amount available to defendant

34.(1)

This section applies where

(a)

(b)

(c)

the Court has made a confiscation order;

the Registrar applies to the Court for the discharge of the order; and

the amount remaining to be paid under the order is less than such sum
as may be prescribed by the Minister by Order.

Where this section applies, the Court shall calculate the amount available
(2)
to the defendant and, in doing so, it shall apply section 17 as if references to the
time the confiscation order is made were to the time of the calculation and as if
references to the date of the confiscation order were to the date of the calculation.

(3)

Where the Court

55

(a)

determines  that  the  amount  available  to  the  defendant  calculated  in
accordance  with  subsection  (2)  is  inadequate  to  meet  the  amount
remaining to be paid; and

(b)

is satisfied that the inadequacy is due wholly to one or more of the
reasons specified in subsection (4),

it may discharge the confiscation order.

(4)

The reasons referred to in subsection (3) are

(a)

in a case where any of the realisable property consists of money in a
currency other than dollars, that fluctuations in currency exchange rates
have occurred; and

(b)

such other reasons as may be prescribed by the Minister by Order.

The discharge of a confiscation order under this section does not prevent
(5)
the making of an application in respect of the order under section 31(1)(d) or 32(1)
(c).

Where on such an application the Court determines that the order should
(6)
be varied under section 31(7) or 32(3), as the case may be, the court may provide
that its discharge under this section is revoked.

Discharge of order where small amount outstanding

35.(1)
The  Court  may,  on  its  own  motion  or  upon  the  application  of  the
person against whom a confiscation order is made, discharge a confiscation order
where the amount remaining to be paid under the order is less than such sum as
may be prescribed by the Minister by Order.

The discharge of a confiscation order under this section does not prevent
(2)
the making of an application in respect of the order under section 31(1)(d) or 32(1)
(c).

56

(3)
Where on such an application the Court determines that the order should
be varied under section 31(7) or 32(3), as the case may be, the court may provide
that its discharge under this section is revoked.

Additional cases where statement of information to be submitted

36.
30 or the prosecutor applies under section 31

Where the Court proceeds under section 15 pursuant to section 29 or

(a)

(b)

the prosecutor shall give the Court a statement of information within
such period as the Court orders;

section 26 applies, with such modifications as may be necessary, where
the prosecutor applies under section 31; and

(c)

sections 27 and 28 apply.

Making of confiscation order where defendant absconds after
conviction or committal

37.(1)

This section applies where

(a)

a defendant absconds

(i)

(ii)

before  or  after  he  is  convicted  of  an  offence  or  offences  in
proceedings before the Court; or

after he is committed to the Court by a magistrate in respect of an
offence or offences under section 68;

(b)

the prosecutor applies to the Court to proceed under this section; and

(c)

the Court believes it is appropriate for it to do so.

Where this section applies, subject to subsections (3) and (4), the Court

(2)
may proceed under section 15.

57

Where the Court proceeds under section 15 pursuant to subsection (1), this

(3)
Part has effect with the following modifications:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

any person the Court believes is likely to be affected by an order under
section  15  is  entitled  to  appear  before  the  Court  and  make
representations;

the Court shall not make an order under section 15 unless the prosecutor
has taken reasonable steps to contact the defendant;

sections 19, 26(3), 27 and 28 shall be ignored; and

sections 29, 30 and 31 shall be ignored while the defendant is still an
absconder.

Where a defendant ceases to be an absconder, section 29 applies instead

(4)
of subsection (3).

Making of confiscation order where defendant absconds and is neither
convicted nor acquitted

38.(1)

This section applies where

(a)

proceedings  for  an  offence  or  offences  are  instituted  against  a
defendant but are not concluded;

(b)

the defendant absconds;

(c)

a  period  of  2  years,  starting  with  the  date  the  Court  believes  the
defendant absconded, has ended;

(d)

the prosecutor applies to the Court to proceed under this section; and

(e)

the Court believes it is appropriate for it to do so.

Where  subsection  (1)  applies,  subject  to  subsection  (3),  the  Court  shall

(2)
proceed under section 15.

58

Where the Court proceeds under section 15 pursuant to this section, this

(3)
Part has effect with the following modifications:

(a)

any person the Court believes is likely to be affected by an order under
section  15  is  entitled  to  appear  before  the  Court  and  make
representations;

(b)

the Court shall not make an order under section 15 unless the prosecutor
has taken reasonable steps to contact the defendant;

(c)

sections 19, 26(3) and 27 to 30 shall be ignored; and

(d)

section 31 shall be ignored while the defendant is still an absconder.

Where the defendant ceases to be an absconder, section 31 has effect as if

(4)
references to the date of conviction were to

(a)

(b)

the day when proceedings for the offence concerned were instituted
against the defendant; or

where  there  are  2  or  more  offences  and  proceedings  for  them  were
instituted on different days, the earliest of those days.

(5)

Where

(a)

(b)

the Court makes an order under section 15 as applied by this section;
and

the defendant is later convicted in proceedings before the Court of the
offence, or any of the offences, concerned,

section 15 does not apply so far as that conviction is concerned.

the Court makes a confiscation order under section 15 as applied by
section 38;

59

(c)

(d)

the  defendant  is  convicted  of  an  offence,  or  any  of  the  offences,
mentioned in section 38(1)(a);

the  defendant  believes  that  the  amount  required  to  be  paid  was  too
large,  taking  into  account  the  circumstances  prevailing  when  the
amount was determined for the purposes of the order; and

(e)

before the end of the relevant period the defendant applies to the Court
to consider the evidence on which his belief is based.

Where,  after  considering  the  evidence,  the  Court  concludes  that  the

(2)
defendant’s belief is well founded, the Court

(a)

shall  determine  the  amount  which  should  have  been  the  amount
required to be paid, taking into account the circumstances prevailing
when the amount was determined for the purposes of the order; and

(b)

may vary the order by substituting for the amount required to be paid,
such amount as it believes is just.

For the purposes of subsection (1), the relevant period is the period of 28

(3)
days starting with

where  there  are  2  or  more  offences  and  the  convictions  were  on
different dates, the date of the latest.

Where section 38(1)(a) applies to more than one offence, the Court shall
(4)
not make an order under this section unless it is satisfied that there is no possibility
of  any  further  proceedings  being  taken  or  continued  in  relation  to  any  such
offence in respect of which the defendant has not been convicted.

60

Discharge of confiscation order made pursuant to section 38

40.(1)
applied by section 38, it shall discharge the order where the defendant

Where  the  Court  makes  a  confiscation  order  under  section  15  as

is later tried for the offence or offences concerned and acquitted on all
counts; and

In the circumstances specified in subsection (2), the Court may discharge

(3)
the order where it determines that

(a)

there has been undue delay in continuing the proceedings mentioned
in section 38(1); or

(b)

the prosecutor does not intend to proceed with the prosecution.

Where the Court discharges a confiscation order under this section it may

(4)
make such consequential or incidental order as it considers appropriate.

Appeal to Court of Appeal in respect of confiscation order

41.(1)
defendant may appeal to the Court of Appeal in respect of the order.

Where  the  Court  makes  a  confiscation  order,  the  prosecutor  or  the

Where the Court decides not to make a confiscation order, the prosecutor

(2)
may appeal to the Court of Appeal against the decision.

61

(3)
of section 29, 30, 37 or 38 unless the appellant is the defendant.

Court’s powers on appeal in respect of confiscation order

42.(1)
set aside or vary the confiscation order.

On an appeal under section 41(1) the Court of Appeal may confirm,

On an appeal under section 41(2), the Court of Appeal may confirm the

(2)
decision, or where it believes the decision was wrong it may

(a)

itself  proceed  under  section  15  (ignoring  subsections  (1)  to  (3)  of
section 15); or

(b)

direct the Court to proceed afresh under section 15.

In proceeding afresh pursuant to this section, the Court shall comply with

any directions the Court of Appeal may give.

Where the Court of Appeal makes or varies a confiscation order under this
(4)
section or the Court does so pursuant to a direction by the Court of Appeal under
this section, the relevant court shall have regard to

(a)

(b)

any fine imposed on the defendant in respect of the offence, or any of
the offences, concerned; and

any order within section 22(1)(b) or (c) that has been made against the
defendant in respect of the offence, or any of the offences, concerned,
unless the order has already been taken into account by the Court in
determining what is the realisable property held by the defendant for
the purposes of section 17.

Where the Court of Appeal proceeds under section 15 or the Court proceeds
(5)
afresh under that section pursuant to a direction under this section, subsections
(6) to (11) apply and in subsections (6) to (10) “court” means the Court of Appeal
or the Court, as the case may be.

Where the court has already sentenced the defendant for the offence, or
(6)
any of the offences concerned, section 15 has effect as if his particular criminal

62

conduct included conduct which constitutes offences which the court has taken
into consideration in deciding his sentence for the offence or offences concerned.

Where  a  compensation  order  has  been  made  against  the  defendant  in

(7)
respect of the offence, or any offences, concerned

(8)
18(1)(a) and (b), take account of

(a)

(b)

(c)

conduct occurring before the relevant date;

property obtained before that date; and

property obtained on or after that date where it was obtained as a result
of, or in connection with, conduct occurring before that date.

(9)

For the purposes of this section

(a)

(b)

(c)

the assumptions specified in section 19(2)(a) and (b) do not apply with
regard to property first held by the defendant on or after the relevant
date;

the assumption specified in section 19(2)(c) does not apply with regard
to expenditure incurred by him on or after that date; and

after that date.

Section 36 applies where the court proceeds under section 15 pursuant to

(10)
this section as section 36 applies in the circumstances specified in section 36.

The relevant date is the date on which the Court decided not to make a

(11)
confiscation order.

Division 3

Forfeiture Orders

Application for forfeiture order

43.(1)
property in respect of a person’s conviction of an offence

Where the prosecutor intends to apply for a forfeiture order against

(a)

(b)

(c)

the prosecutor shall give no less than 14 days’ written notice of the
application to the person and to any other person who the prosecutor
has reason to believe may have an interest in the property;

the person, and any other person who claims an interest in the property,
may appear and adduce evidence at the hearing of the application; and

the  Court  may,  at  any  time  before  the  final  determination  of  the
application, direct the prosecutor to

(i)

(ii)

give notice of the application to any person who, in the opinion of
the Court, appears to have an interest in the property; and

publish,  at  least  twice,  in  the  Official  Gazette  and  in  a  daily
newspaper widely circulated in Barbados, notice of the application
in the manner and containing the particulars, and within the time,
that the Court considers appropriate.

The prosecutor may, before the final determination of an application for a
(2)
forfeiture order, apply to the Court to amend the application to include any other
property, and the Court may so amend the application where it is satisfied that

(a)

(b)

the  property  was  not  reasonably  capable  of  identification  when  the
application was originally made; or

necessary  evidence  became  available  only  after  the  application  was
originally made.

Where  the  prosecutor  intends  to  apply  to  amend  an  application  for  a
(3)
forfeiture order and the amendment would have the effect of including additional

64

property in the application for the forfeiture order, the prosecutor shall give no
less than 14 days’ written notice of the application to amend to any person who
he has reason to believe may have an interest in the property to be included in
the application for the forfeiture order.

Any person who claims an interest in the property to be included in the
(4)
application for the forfeiture order may appear and adduce evidence at the hearing
of the application to amend it.

Where an application under this section is finally determined, no further
(5)
application for a forfeiture order may be made in respect of the offence for which
the person was convicted unless the Court gives leave for the making of a new
application on being satisfied that

(a)

(b)

the property to which the new application relates was identified after
the previous application was determined;

necessary evidence became available after the previous application was
determined; or

(c)

it is in the interests of justice that the new application be made.

The prosecutor shall not make an application under this section after the

(6)
end of the relevant application period in relation to the conviction.

In subsection (6) “relevant application period”, in relation to a person’s
(7)
conviction of an offence, means the period of 12 months, where the person is to
be taken to have been convicted of the offence by reason of

(a)

(b)

(c)

subsection (8)(a), after the day on which the person was convicted of
the offence;

subsection (8)(b), after the day on which the person was discharged
without conviction;

subsection (8)(c), after the day on which the court took the offence into
account in passing sentence for the other offence referred to therein.

65

For the purposes of subsection (7), a person is to be taken to be convicted

(8)
of an offence where

(a)

(b)

(c)

he is convicted, whether summarily or on indictment, of the offence;

he is charged with the offence and is found guilty but is discharged
without conviction; or

a court with his consent takes the offence, of which he has not been
found guilty, into account in sentencing him for another offence.

Making of forfeiture order

Where the prosecutor applies to the Court for a forfeiture order against
44.(1)
property in respect of a person’s conviction of an offence and the Court is satisfied
that the property is property of the nature specified in section 13(2)(b) or (c) in
respect  of  the  offence,  the  Court  may  order  that  the  property  or  such  of  the
property as is specified by the Court in the order be forfeited to the Crown.

In  determining  whether  property  is  property  of  the  nature  specified  in

(2)
section 13(2)(b) or (c) the Court may infer that

(a)

(b)

the property was used in, or in connection with, or was intended to be
used in, or in connection with, the commission of the offence, where
the  evidence  establishes  that  the  property  was  in  the  person’s
possession at the time of, or immediately after, the commission of the
offence for which the person was convicted;

the  property  was  obtained  as  a  result  of,  or  in  connection  with,  the
commission  by  the  person  of  the  offence  for  which  the  person  was
convicted,  where  the  evidence  establishes  that  property,  and  in
particular money, was found in the person’s possession or under his
control  in  a  building,  vehicle,  receptacle  or  other  place  during  the
course  of  investigations  conducted  by  the  police  before  or  after  the
arrest and charge of the person for the offence for which the person
was convicted;

66

(c)

the value of the increase represents property which was obtained as a
result of, or in connection with, the commission by the person of the
offence  for  which  the  person  was  convicted,  where  the  evidence
establishes that the value, after the commission of the offence, of all
ascertainable property of the person convicted of the offence exceeds
the  value  of  all  ascertainable  property  of  the  person  prior  to  the
commission of the offence, and the Court is satisfied that the income
of  the  person  from  sources  unrelated  to  the  criminal  conduct  of  the
person cannot reasonably account for the increase in value.

Where the Court orders that property, other than money, be forfeited to the
(3)
Crown, the Court shall specify in the order the amount that it considers to be the
value of the property at the time when the order is made.

In  considering  whether  a  forfeiture  order  should  be  made  under

(4)
subsection (1), the Court shall have regard to

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

the rights and interests, if any, of third parties in the property;

the gravity of the offence concerned;

any  hardship  that  may  reasonably  be  expected  to  be  caused  to  any
person, by the operation of the order; and

the use that is ordinarily made of the property, or the use to which the
property was intended to be put.

Where  the  Court  makes  a  forfeiture  order  the  Court  may  give  such

(5)
directions as are necessary or convenient for giving effect to the order.

Effect of forfeiture order

45.(1)
Subject to subsection (2), where the Court makes a forfeiture order
against any property, the property vests absolutely in the Crown by virtue of the
order.

67

Where property directed by a forfeiture order to be forfeited is registrable

(2)
property

(a)

the property vests in the Crown in equity but does not vest in the Crown
at  law  until  the  applicable  registration  requirements  have  been
complied with;

(b)

the Crown is entitled to be registered as owner of the property; and

(c)

the  Attorney-General  has  power  on  behalf  of  the  Crown  to  do,  or
authorise the doing of, anything necessary or convenient to obtain the
registration  of  the  Crown  as  owner,  including  the  execution  of  any
instrument required to be executed by a person transferring an interest
in property of that kind.

(3)

Where the Court makes a forfeiture order against property

(a)

(b)

the  property  shall  not,  except  with  the  leave  of  the  Court  and  in
accordance  with  any  directions  of  the  Court,  be  disposed  of,  or
otherwise dealt with, by or on behalf of the Crown, before the relevant
appeal date; and

if, after the relevant appeal date, the order has not been discharged, the
property  may  be  disposed  of  and  the  proceeds  applied  or  otherwise
dealt with in accordance with the directions of the Recovery Authority;
and the directions shall be followed.

(4)
Without limiting the generality of subsection (3)(b) the directions that may
be given pursuant to that subsection include a direction that the property is to be
disposed of in accordance with the provisions of any enactment specified in the
direction.

(5)

In this section

“registrable property” means property the title to which is passed by registration

in accordance with the Land Registration Act, Cap. 229;

68

“relevant appeal date” used in relation to a forfeiture order made in consequence

of a person’s conviction of an offence, means

(a)

(b)

the  date  on  which  the  period  allowed  by  the  rules  of  court  for  the
lodging of an appeal against a person’s conviction or for the lodging
of an appeal against the making of a forfeiture order expires without
an appeal having been lodged, whichever is the later; or

where an appeal against a person’s conviction or against the making
of a forfeiture order is lodged, the date on which the appeal lapses in
accordance with the rules of court or is finally determined, whichever
is the later.

Voidable transfers

46.

The Court may

(a)

(b)

before making a forfeiture order; and

in the case of property in respect of which a restraining order was made,
where the order was served in accordance with section 54(5),

set aside any conveyance or transfer of the property that occurred after the seizure
of the property or the service of the restraining order, unless the conveyance or
transfer was made for valuable consideration to a person acting in good faith and
without notice.

Protection of third parties in relation to forfeiture order

69

(2)
Where  a  person  applies  to  the  Court  for  an  order  under  this  section  in
respect  of  his  interest  in  property  and  the  Court  is  satisfied  on  a  balance  of
probabilities

(a)

(b)

that he was not in any way involved in the commission of the offence;
and

where he acquired the interest during or after the commission of the
offence, that he acquired the interest

(i)

for sufficient consideration; and

(ii)

without knowing, and in circumstances such as not to arouse a
reasonable suspicion, that the property was, at the time he acquired
it, property of the nature specified in section 13(2)(b) or (c),

the Court shall make an order declaring the nature, extent and value (as at the
time the order is made) of his interest.

Subject to subsection (4), where a forfeiture order has already been made
(3)
directing the forfeiture of property, a person who claims an interest in the property
may, before the end of the period of 12 months beginning on the day on which
the forfeiture order is made, apply under this subsection to the Court for an order
under subsection (2).

(4)

A person who

(a)

had knowledge of the application for the forfeiture order before the
order was made; or

(b)

appeared at the hearing of that application,

shall not be permitted to make an application under subsection (3), except with
the leave of the Court.

A person who intends to make an application under subsection (1) or (3)
(5)

(6)

(7)
The Recovery Authority shall, on application made by any person who has
obtained an order under subsection (2), and where the period allowed by the rules
of court with respect to the making of appeals has expired or any appeal from
that order taken under subsection (6) has been determined, direct that

(a)

(b)

the property or the part thereof to which the interest of the applicant
relates be returned to the applicant; or

an amount equal to the value of the interest of the applicant, as declared
in the order, be paid to the applicant;

and the directions shall be followed.

Discharge of forfeiture order on appeal and quashing of conviction

Where the Court makes a forfeiture order against property in reliance
48.(1)
on  a  person’s  conviction  of  an  offence  and  the  conviction  is  subsequently
quashed, the quashing of the conviction discharges the order.

(2)
Where a forfeiture order against property is discharged as provided for in
subsection (1) or by the court hearing an appeal against the making of the order,
any person who claims to have an interest in the property immediately before the
making of the forfeiture order may apply to the Recovery Authority in writing
for the transfer of the interest to the person.

On receipt of an application under subsection (2) the Recovery Authority

(3)
shall

(a)

where  the  interest  is  vested  in  the  Crown,  give  directions  that  the
property or part thereof to which the interest of the applicant relates be
transferred to the person; or

(b)

in any other case, direct that there be payable to the person an amount
equal to the value of the interest as at the time the order is made;

and the directions shall be followed.

71

(4)
In the exercise of his powers under this section and section 47 the Recovery
Authority shall have the power to do or authorise the doing of anything necessary
or convenient to effect the transfer or return of property, including the execution
of  any  instrument  and  the  making  of  an  application  for  the  registration  of  an
interest in the property on any appropriate register.

Payment instead of forfeiture order

49.
Where the Court is satisfied that a forfeiture order should be made in
respect of the property of a person convicted of an offence but that the property
or any part thereof or interest therein cannot be made subject to such an order
and, in particular

(a)

(b)

cannot, on the exercise of due diligence, be located;

has been transferred to a third party in circumstances which do not give
rise to a reasonable inference that the title or interest was transferred
for the purpose of avoiding the forfeiture of the property;

(c)

is located outside Barbados;

(d)

has been substantially diminished in value or rendered worthless; or

(e)

has  been  commingled  with  other  property  that  cannot  be  divided
without difficulty,

the Court may, instead of ordering the property or part thereof or interest therein
to be forfeited, order the person to pay to the Crown an amount equal to the value
of the property, part or interest.

Application for forfeiture order on abscondence

50.(1)
Where a person absconds in connection with an offence committed
after  the  commencement  date,  the  prosecutor  may  apply  to  the  Court  for  a

nature specified in section 13(2)(b) or (c).

72

as it considers appropriate for ensuring that the restraining order is effective.

In considering whether to make an order under subsection (6), the Court

shall,  in  particular,  consider  whether  any  restriction  or  prohibition  on  the
defendant's  travel  outside  Barbados  ought  to  be  imposed  for  the  purpose
mentioned in that subsection.

(8)

shall discharge the restraining order where, within a reasonable
period,  proceedings  for  the  offence  are  not  instituted  or  the
application is not made, as the case may be.

(3)
Where a restraining order was made on the basis that an external request
for the making, in Barbados, of an order to prohibit dealing with relevant property
was accepted, the Court shall discharge the order where

(a)

at  the  conclusion  of  the  proceedings  for  an  offence  with  respect  to
which the order was made, no external order is made; or

(b)

within a reasonable period, no external order is made.

Hearsay evidence

56.(1)

For  the  purposes  of  this  section,  managing  or  otherwise  dealing  with

(6)
property includes

(a)

selling the property or any part or interest in it;

84

(b)

where the property comprises assets of a trade or business, carrying on,
or arranging for another person to carry on, the trade or business; and

(c)

incurring capital expenditure in respect of the property.

(7)
The  Court  shall  not,  in  respect  of  any  property,  exercise  the  powers
conferred by subsection (4) or (5) unless the Court gives any person holding an
interest in the property a reasonable opportunity to make representations to the
Court.

(8)

For the purpose of

(a)

(b)

subsection  (1)(a)(ii),  a  reference  in  subsections  (2)  and  (5)  to  a
confiscation order shall be treated as a reference to the external order;
and

subsection (1)(b), a reference in subsections (2) and (5) to realisable
property shall be treated as a reference to the specified property referred
to in the external order.

Effect of restraining order or order appointing enforcement receiver

59.(1)
Where the Court makes a restraining order or an order appointing an
enforcement receiver, no distress may be levied against any realisable property
to which the order applies except with the leave of the Court and subject to any
terms the Court may impose.

Where a restraining order or an order appointing an enforcement receiver
(2)
applies to a tenancy of any premises, no landlord or other person to whom rent
is payable may exercise a right of forfeiture by peaceable re-entry in relation to
the premises in respect of any failure by the tenant to comply with any term or
condition of the tenancy, except with the leave of the Court and subject to any
terms the Court may impose.

Where proceedings are pending before the Court in respect of any property
(3)
and the Court is satisfied that a restraining order or an order for the appointment
of an enforcement receiver has been applied for or made in respect of the property,

85

the Court may stay the proceedings or allow them to continue on any terms the
Court thinks fit.

The Court shall, before exercising any power conferred by subsection (3),
(4)
give the prosecutor and any management or enforcement receiver appointed in
respect of the property a reasonable opportunity to make representations to the
Court.

Application of proceeds of realisation and other sums

Subject to subsection (2), an enforcement receiver shall, after making
60.(1)
such payments as the Court may direct, out of the following sums in his hands:

(a)

the proceeds of the realisation of any property realised pursuant to his
powers under section 58; and

(b)

any other sums in which a defendant holds an interest,

apply the remainder, if any, on the defendant’s behalf towards the satisfaction of
the confiscation order.

Where, after the amount payable under a confiscation order has been fully
(2)
paid, any such sums remain in the hands of an enforcement receiver, the receiver
shall distribute them

(a)

among such of those who held property which has been realised under
this Act; and

(b)

in such proportions,

as the Court may direct after giving a reasonable opportunity for such persons to
make representations to the Court.

The receipt of any sum by the Registrar on account of an amount payable
(3)
under a confiscation order shall reduce, by the amount of the sum received, the
amount so payable, but the Registrar shall apply the sum received for the purposes
specified in this section and in the order so specified.

86

(4)
Where a receiver appointed under this Act pays money to the Registrar,
the Registrar shall pay the receiver’s remuneration and expenses before applying
the sum for any other purpose.

(5)
Where the Court makes an order under section 22(4), the Registrar shall,
after making any payment required by subsection (4), next apply any balance in
his  hands  in  payment  of  such  amount  of  the  compensation  order  as  may  be
outstanding.

Any balance in the hands of the Registrar after he has made all payments

(6)
required by this section shall be paid into the Criminal Assets Recovery Fund.

A reference in this section to a confiscation order shall deemed to include

(7)
a reference to an external order described in section 58(1).

Receivers not liable for certain action

61.

Where a management or enforcement receiver

(a)

takes action in relation to property

(i)

which is not realisable property; or

(ii)

in the case of an external order described in section 58(1)(b), which
is not the specified property;

(b)

would  be  entitled  to  take  the  action  if  the  property  were  realisable
property or the specified property, as the case may be; and

(c)

believes on reasonable grounds that he is entitled to take the action,

the receiver is not liable to any person in respect of any loss or damage resulting
from the action, except so far as the loss or damage is caused by his negligence.

Receivers and other interested persons may seek Court’s directions

62.
A receiver or any person who is, or may be, affected by any action
that the receiver takes or proposes to take may apply to the Court for an order
giving directions on the exercise of the powers of the receiver; and the Court may
make such order as it considers appropriate.

87

Discharge and variation of section 57 or 58 order

63.(1)
A receiver, prosecutor or person affected by an order under section
57 or 58 may apply to the Court to vary or discharge the order; and the Court
may vary or discharge the order as it considers appropriate.

In the case of an order under section 57, where the condition in section

(2)
52(1) which was satisfied was that

(a)

(b)

proceedings were instituted or an application was made, the Court shall
discharge  the  order  on  the  conclusion  of  the  proceedings  or  the
application, as the case may be;

an investigation was started or an application was to be made, the Court
shall  discharge  the  order  where,  within  a  reasonable  period,
proceedings for the offence are not instituted or the application is not
made, as the case may be.

Discharge of management receiver

64.(1)
the Court

(a)

(b)

Where a management receiver is appointed in respect of property and

appoints  an  enforcement  receiver,  the  Court  shall  order  the
management  receiver  to  transfer  to  the  enforcement  receiver  all
property that he holds by virtue of the exercise of his powers;

makes a forfeiture order against the property or a part of the property,
the Court shall, without prejudice to the generality of section 44(5),
order  the  management  receiver  to  transfer,  to  such  person  as  the
Recovery Authority may appoint or identify for the purpose or such
person as the Court may direct, all or any part of the property that he
holds by virtue of the exercise of his powers.

Subsection (1) does not apply to property which the management receiver

(2)
holds by virtue of the exercise by him of his power under section 57(2)(d).

88

(3)
Where the management receiver complies with an order under subsection
(1) he is discharged from his appointment under section 57 and any obligation
under this Act arising from his appointment.

Where  this  section  applies,  the  Court  may  make  such  consequential  or

(4)
incidental order as it considers appropriate.

Winding up of company holding realisable property

65.(1)
Where realisable property is held by a company and an order for the
winding up of the company has been made or a resolution has been passed by the
company  for  the  voluntary  winding  up  of  the  company,  the  functions  of  the
liquidator shall not be exercisable in relation to

(a)

(b)

property for the time being subject to a restraining order made before
the relevant time; and

any proceeds of property for the time being in the hands of a receiver
appointed under this Act.

Where,  in  the  case  of  a  company,  an  order  or  resolution  referred  to  in
(2)
subsection (1) has been made or passed, as the case may be, the powers conferred
on the Court by sections 53 to 60 shall not be exercised in relation to any realisable
property held by the company in relation to which the functions of the liquidator
are exercisable so as to

(a)

(b)

inhibit  him  from  exercising  those  functions  for  the  purpose  of
distributing  any  property  held  by  the  company  to  the  company’s
creditors; or

prevent  the  payment  out  of  any  property  of  expenses,  including  the
remuneration of the liquidator, properly incurred in the winding up in
respect of the property.

Subsection (2) does not affect the enforcement of a charge made before
(3)
the  relevant  time  on  property  which  was  subject  to  a  restraining  order  at  the
relevant time.

(4)

In this section “relevant time” means

89

(a)

(b)

where no order for the winding up of the company has been made, the
time of the passing of the resolution for voluntary winding up;

where such an order has been made and, before the presentation of the
petition  for  the  winding  up  of  the  company  by  the  Court,  such  a
resolution had been passed by the company, the time of the passing of
the resolution; and

(c)

in any other case where such an order has been made, the time of the
making of the order.

Exercise of powers by Court and receiver

66.(1)

This section applies to the powers conferred

(a)

(b)

on the Court by sections 53 to 60; and

on a management or an enforcement receiver,

in relation to a confiscation order that has been, or may be, made or a forfeiture
order that may be made.

Subject to subsections (3), (4) and (5), the powers referred to in subsection

(2)
(1)

(a)

shall be exercised

(i)

(ii)

with a view to the value for the time being of realisable property
being  made  available,  by  the  realisation  of  the  property,  for
satisfying any confiscation order that has been, or may be, made
against the defendant;

in a case where a confiscation order or a forfeiture order has not
been made, with a view to securing that there is no diminution in
the value of realisable property;

(iii)

without taking account of any obligation of the defendant or a
recipient of a tainted gift, where the obligation conflicts with the

90

objective of satisfying any confiscation order that has been made,
or may be made, against the defendant; and

(b)

may be exercised in respect of a debt owed by the Crown.

(3)

Subsection (2) has effect subject to the following:

(a)

(b)

(c)

the powers must be exercised with a view to allowing a person other
than the defendant or a recipient of a tainted gift to retain or recover
the value of any interest held by him;

in the case of realisable property held by a recipient of a tainted gift,
the powers must be exercised with a view to realising no more than the
value for the time being of the gift; and

in  a  case  where  a  confiscation  order  has  not  been  made  against  the
defendant, property must not be sold where the Court so orders under
subsection (4).

Where on an application by the defendant, or by the recipient of a tainted
(4)
gift, the Court decides that the property cannot be replaced the Court may order
that the property must not be sold.

(5)

An order under subsection (4) may be revoked or varied.

A  reference  in  this  section  to  a  confiscation  order  shall  be  deemed  to

(6)
include a reference to an external order described in section 58(1).

For the purposes of the application of this section and of sections 57(5) and

(7)
58(5) to an external request or an external order, as the case may be

(a)

a gift is tainted where it was made by the defendant at any time after

(i)

(ii)

the  date  on  which  the  offence  to  which  the  external  request  or
external order relates was committed; or

where his criminal conduct consists of 2 or more such offences
and they were committed on different dates, the date of the earliest;

91

(b)

(c)

an offence which is a continuing offence is committed, for the purpose
of paragraph (a), on the first occasion when it is committed; and

a  gift  may  be  a  tainted  gift  where  it  was  made  before  the
commencement date.

Division 5

General Provisions related to Part II

Compensation where defendant not convicted etc.

67.(1)
offences to which this Act applies and either

Where proceedings are instituted against a person for an offence or

(a)

(b)

the proceedings do not result in his conviction for any such offence; or

where he is convicted of one or more such offences,

(i)

the conviction or convictions concerned are quashed; or

(ii)

he  is  pardoned  in  respect  of  the  conviction  or  convictions,  the
Court may,

subject to this section, on an application by a person who held property which
was realisable property, order compensation to be paid to the applicant where,
having regard to all the circumstances, it considers it appropriate to make such
an order.

The Court shall not order compensation to be paid in any case unless the

(2)
Court is satisfied that

(a)

(b)

there has been some serious default on the part of a person concerned
in the investigation or prosecution of the offence concerned; and

the  applicant  has  suffered  loss  in  consequence  of  anything  done  in
relation to the property by or pursuant to an order under this Act.

92

(3)
The Court shall not order compensation to be paid in any case where it
appears to the Court that the proceedings would have been instituted or continued
even if the serious default had not occurred.

The amount of compensation to be paid under this section shall be such as

(4)
the Court thinks just in all the circumstances of the case.

Committal by magistrate

68.(1)

This section applies where

(a)

(b)

a defendant is convicted of an offence by a magistrate; and

the prosecutor asks a magistrate to commit the defendant to the Court
with a view to a confiscation order or forfeiture order being considered.

(2)

Where this section applies, the magistrate

(a)

(b)

shall commit the defendant to the Court in respect of the offence; and

may commit him to the Court in respect of any other offence falling
within subsection (3).

(3)

An offence falls within this subsection where

(a)

(b)

the defendant has been convicted of it by a magistrate; and

the magistrate has power to deal with him in respect of it.

Where a defendant is committed to the Court under this section in respect

(4)
of an offence or offences, the Court

(a)

(b)

shall inquire into the circumstances of the case;

may deal with the defendant in any way in which the magistrate could
deal with him if he had just convicted him of the offence; and

(c)

section 13 applies accordingly.

(5)

A committal under this section may be in custody or on bail.

93

PART III

CIVIL RECOVERY OF PROCEEDS AND INSTRUMENTALITIES OF
CRIME

Division 1

Preliminary to Part III

Scope of Part III

69.(1)

This Part has effect for the purposes of enabling

(a)

the  Recovery  Authority  to  recover  in  civil  proceedings  before  the
Court, property which is, or represents

(i)

property obtained through unlawful conduct;

(ii)

property used in, or in connection with, or intended to be used in,
or in connection with, unlawful conduct; and

(b)

property which is, or represents, property obtained through unlawful
conduct, or which is intended to be used in unlawful conduct, to be
forfeited in civil proceedings.

The  powers  conferred  by  this  Part  are  exercisable  in  relation  to  any
(2)
property, including cash, whether or not proceedings have been brought for an
offence in connection with the property.

Interpretation of Part III

70.(1)

In this Part

“assigned matter” has the meaning assigned to it in section 2(1) of the Customs

Act, Cap. 66;

“excepted joint owner” has the meaning specified in section 95(3);

“period of 72 hours” excludes Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays;

“property  obtained  through  unlawful  conduct”  has  the  meaning  specified  in

94

section 72;

“respondent” means

(a)

(b)

where proceedings are brought by the Recovery Authority under this
Part, the person against whom the proceedings are brought; and

where  no  such  proceedings  have  been  brought  but  the  Recovery
Authority has applied for a freezing order, the person against whom
the Recovery Authority intends to bring such proceedings;

“tainted  property”  means,  subject  to  subsection  (3),  property  used  in,  or  in
connection with, or intended to be used in, or in connection with, unlawful
conduct;

“value” means market value.

For the purposes of this Part, proceedings against a person for an offence

(2)
are concluded when

(a)

(b)

(c)

the person is convicted or acquitted;

the prosecution is discontinued; or

the jury is discharged without a finding.

Property  belonging  to  a  person  (“the  owner”)  is  not  tainted  property

(3)
where

(a)

(b)

the  unlawful  conduct  concerned  is  not  the  unlawful  conduct  of  the
owner; and

the owner does not give his consent, express or implied, to the property
being used in, or in connection with, the unlawful conduct.

For the purposes of subsection (3), the “unlawful conduct concerned” is
(4)
the  unlawful  conduct  that  the  property  is  used  in,  or  in  connection  with,  or
intended to be used in, or in connection with.

(5)

Sections 71 to 81 and this section have effect for the purposes of this Part.

95

Meaning of “unlawful conduct”

71.(1)

“Unlawful conduct” is conduct which, if it occurs in

(a)

(b)

Barbados, is unlawful under the criminal law of Barbados; or

a country other than Barbados

(i)

is unlawful under the criminal law of that country; and

(ii)

if it occurred in Barbados, would be unlawful under the criminal
law of Barbados.

The Court, or in respect of proceedings for the forfeiture of cash or listed
(2)
assets, a magistrate, shall decide on a balance of probabilities whether it is proved
that

(a)

(b)

any matters alleged to constitute unlawful conduct have occurred; or

any person used, or intended to use, any property in, or in connection
with, unlawful conduct.

Meaning of “property obtained through unlawful conduct”

A person obtains property through unlawful conduct, whether his own
72.(1)
conduct or another person’s conduct, where he obtains property by or in return
for the conduct.

In deciding whether any property was obtained through unlawful conduct

(2)
it is

(a)

(b)

immaterial whether or not any money, goods or services were provided
in  order  to  put  the  person  in  question  in  a  position  to  carry  out  the
conduct; and

not necessary to show that the conduct was of a particular kind where
it is shown that the property was obtained through conduct of one of a
number of kinds, each of which would have been unlawful conduct.

96

Recoverable property

73.(1)
and tainted property is recoverable property.

Subject to subsection (2), property obtained through unlawful conduct

(2)
Property  obtained  through  unlawful  conduct  that  has  been  disposed  of
since it was obtained through unlawful conduct and tainted property that has been
disposed of since it became tainted property, is recoverable property only where
the property is held by a person into whose hands it may be followed.

Recoverable property may be followed into the hands of a person obtaining

(3)
it on a disposal

(a)

in the case of

(i)

(ii)

property obtained through unlawful conduct, by the person who,
through the conduct, obtained the property;

tainted property, by any person who had possession of the property
for  the  purpose,  or  with  the  intent,  of  using  the  property  for
unlawful conduct; or

(b)

by a person into whose hands it may, by virtue of this subsection, be
followed.

Tracing recoverable property

74.(1)
Where  property  obtained  through  unlawful  conduct  or  tainted
property (“the original property”) is or has been recoverable property, property
which represents the original property is also recoverable property.

(2)

Where a person enters into a transaction by which he

(a)

disposes  of  recoverable  property,  whether  the  original  property  or
property which, by virtue of this Part, represents the original property;
and

(b)

obtains other property in place of it;

97

the other property represents the original property.

Where  a  person  disposes  of  recoverable  property  which  represents  the
(3)
original property, the property may be followed into the hands of the person who
obtains it, and it continues to represent the original property.

Mixing recoverable property

Where a person’s recoverable property is mixed with other property,
75.(1)
whether  the  other  property  is  his  property  or  another  person’s  property,  the
portion of the mixed property which is attributable to the recoverable property
represents  the  property  obtained  through  unlawful  conduct  or  the  tainted
property, as the case may be.

Without limiting subsection (1), recoverable property is mixed with other

(2)
property where it is used, among other things,

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

to increase funds held in a bank account;

in part payment for the acquisition of an asset;

for the restoration or improvement of land;

for the discharge, in whole or in part, of a mortgage, charge or other
security; or

by  a  person  holding  a  leasehold  interest  in  property  to  acquire  the
freehold.

Profits accruing on recoverable property

76.
Where  a  person  who  has  recoverable  property  obtains  additional
property consisting of profits accruing in respect of the recoverable property, the
additional property is to be treated as representing the property obtained through
unlawful conduct or the tainted property, as the case may be.

98

Cases in which property is not, or ceases to be, recoverable

77.(1)

Where

(a)

(b)

a person disposes of recoverable property; and

the person who obtains the property on the disposal does so in good
faith, for value and without notice that it was recoverable property,

the property may not be followed into that person’s hands and, accordingly, it
ceases to be recoverable.

(2)

Recoverable property ceases to be recoverable

(a)

where it is vested, forfeited or otherwise disposed of pursuant to powers
conferred by virtue of this Part;

(b)

where

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

pursuant to a judgment in civil proceedings, whether in Barbados
or elsewhere, a defendant makes a payment to a claimant or the
claimant otherwise obtains property from the defendant;

the  claimant’s  claim  is  based  on  the  defendant’s  unlawful
conduct; and

apart  from  this  paragraph,  the  sum  received,  or  the  property
obtained, by the claimant would be recoverable property; or

(c)

where a payment is made to a person under a compensation order and,
apart  from  this  paragraph,  the  sum  received  would  be  recoverable
property.

(3)

Property is not recoverable where

(a)

a restraining order applies to it, whether made under

(i)

this Act; or

(ii)

another enactment;

99

(b)

it has been taken into account in determining the amount of a person’s
benefit from criminal conduct for the purpose of making a confiscation
order under

(i)

this Act; or

(ii)

another enactment.

The reference to the amount of a person’s benefit from criminal conduct
(4)
is to be construed, in relation to an order mentioned in subsection (3)(b)(ii), as a
reference to the corresponding amount under the enactment in question.

(5)

Where

(a)

(b)

a person enters into a transaction to which section 74(2) applies; and

the disposal is one to which subsection (1) or subsection (2)(a) applies,

this section does not affect the recoverability, by virtue of section 74(2), of any
property obtained on the transaction in the place of the property disposed of.

Minister may prescribe cases in which property is not recoverable or
associated property

78.(1)
The Minister may by Order subject to negative Resolution provide
that property is not recoverable or, as the case may be, associated property where
it is

(a)

(b)

property specified in the Order or property of the description specified
in the Order; or

disposed  of  pursuant  to  an  enactment  specified  in  the  Order  or  an
enactment of a description specified in the Order.

(2)

An Order made under subsection (1) may

(a)

provide that where property is disposed of pursuant to an enactment
specified in the Order or an enactment of a description specified in the
Order, it is to be treated for the purposes of section 99 as if it had been
disposed of pursuant to a recovery order;

100

(b)

apply to property, or a disposal of property, only in such circumstances
as may be prescribed in the Order, and the circumstances may relate to
the property or disposal itself or to a person who holds or has held the
property or to any other matter.

Granting interests in recoverable property

Where  a  person  grants  an  interest  in  his  recoverable  property,  the
79.(1)
question whether the interest is also recoverable is to be determined in the same
manner  as  that  question  is  determined  on  any  other  disposal  of  recoverable
property.

In  furtherance  of  subsection  (1),  where  a  person  grants  an  interest  in

(2)
property and that property

(a)

(b)

is property obtained through unlawful conduct or tainted property, the
interest  is  also  to  be  treated  as  obtained  through  that  conduct  or  as
tainted property, as the case may be; and

represents in his hands property obtained through unlawful conduct or
tainted property, the interest is also to be treated as representing in his
hands the property so obtained or the tainted property, as the case may
be.

Meaning of “associated property”

80.
“Associated  property”  means,  in  relation  to  recoverable  property,
property  of  any  of  the  following  descriptions  (including  property  held  by  a
respondent) which is not itself the recoverable property:

(a)

(b)

(c)

any interest in the recoverable property;

any other interest in the property in which the recoverable property
subsists;

where the recoverable property is a tenancy in common, the tenancy
of the other tenant;

101

(d)

where the recoverable property is part of a larger property, but not a
separate part, the remainder of the larger property,

and a reference to property being associated with recoverable property shall be
construed accordingly.

Obtaining and disposing of property

A reference to a person disposing of his property includes a reference
81.(1)
to his disposing of a part of it or granting an interest in it or both, and a reference
to the property disposed of is to any property obtained on the disposal.

A person who makes a payment to another person is to be treated as making
(2)
a disposal of his property to the other person, whatever form the payment takes.

Where  a  person’s  property  passes  to  another  person  under  a  will  or
(3)
intestacy or otherwise by operation of law, it is to be treated as disposed of by
him to the other person.

A person is only to be treated as having obtained his property for value in
(4)
a  case  where  he  gave  unexecuted  consideration  where  the  consideration  has
become executed consideration.

Division 2

Recovery Orders and Freezing Orders

Making of Recovery Orders and Freezing Orders

Application for recovery order

82.(1)
The Recovery Authority may apply to the Court, by way of a claim
form,  for  a  recovery  order  against  any  person  who  the  Recovery  Authority
believes holds recoverable property.

(2)

The Recovery Authority shall serve the claim form

(a)

on the respondent; and

102

(b)

unless the Court dispenses with service, on any other person who the
Recovery  Authority  believes  holds  associated  property  which  the
Recovery Authority wishes to be subject to the recovery order.

(3)

The claim form shall

(a)

specify  or  describe  generally,  the  property  in  relation  to  which  the
Recovery Authority seeks the order;

(b)

state, in relation to each item or description of property identified

(i)

(ii)

whether it is alleged that the property is recoverable property or
associated property; and

who  is  alleged  to  hold  the  property  or,  where  the  Recovery
Authority is unable to identify the person who holds the property,
the  steps  that  have  been  taken  to  establish  the  identity  of  the
person.

Application for freezing order

Where  the  Recovery  Authority  may  institute  proceedings  for  a
83.(1)
recovery order, the Recovery Authority may apply to the Court, whether before
or after instituting the proceedings, for an order to prohibit any person whose
property is specified or described in the order from in any way dealing with the
property.

An application for a freezing order may be made without notice where the
(2)
circumstances are such that notice of the application would prejudice any right
of the Recovery Authority to obtain a recovery order in respect of any property
to which the order relates.

103

(3)

The Court may make a freezing order

(a)

where it is satisfied

(i)

that there is a good arguable case that

(A)

(B)

the property to which the application for the order relates is
or includes recoverable property; and

in  a  case  where  any  of  the  property  is  not  recoverable
property, it is associated property; and

(ii)

in a case where the property to which the application for the order
relates includes property alleged to be associated property, and the
Recovery Authority has not established the identity of the person
who holds it, that the Recovery Authority has taken all reasonable
steps to do so; and

(b)

subject to such exclusions and conditions as are permitted by this Act
or as the Court considers appropriate.

Variation and setting aside of freezing order

84.(1)

The Court may at any time vary or set aside a freezing order.

Where the Court determines that any property to which a freezing order
(2)
applies is neither recoverable property nor associated property, the Court shall
vary the order so as to exclude the property.

The Court shall, unless acting under subsection (2), give the parties to the
(3)
proceedings, any receiver appointed in respect of property subject to the freezing
order and any person who may be affected by its decision an opportunity to be
heard before varying or setting aside the order.

Exclusions from freezing order

85.(1)

The power to make or vary a freezing order includes the power to

(a)

exclude specified property, or property described in the order, from the
order; and

104

(b)

otherwise make exclusions from the prohibition on dealing with the
property to which the order applies.

(2)
An  exclusion  may  be  made  subject  to  such  conditions  as  the  Court
considers appropriate and may, in particular, make provision for the purpose of
enabling any person to

(a)

(b)

meet any legal expenses and reasonable living expenses; or

carry on any trade, business, profession or occupation.

Where the Court exercises the power to make an exclusion for the purpose
(3)
of enabling a person to meet legal expenses that he has incurred, or may incur,
in respect of proceedings under this Part, it must ensure that the exclusion

(a)

(b)

is limited to reasonable legal expenses that the person has reasonably
incurred or that he reasonably incurs; and

specifies  the  total  amount  that  may  be  released  for  legal  expenses
pursuant to the exclusion.

Subject to subsections (2) and (3), the power to make exclusions must be
(4)
exercised with a view to ensuring, so far as practicable, that the satisfaction of
any right of the Recovery Authority to recover the property obtained through
unlawful conduct or the tainted property is not unduly prejudiced.

The Court may vary a freezing order so as to exclude from the property to
(5)
which the order applies any property which is alleged to be associated property
where the Court thinks that the satisfaction of any right of the Recovery Authority
to recover the property obtained through unlawful conduct or the tainted property
will not be prejudiced.

The Court may exclude any property within subsection (5) on such terms
(6)
or conditions applying, while the freezing order has effect, which the Court thinks
necessary or expedient.

105

Effect of freezing order

86.(1)

Where a freezing order has effect

(a)

(b)

the  Court  may  stay  any  action,  execution  or  other  legal  process  in
respect of the property to which the order applies; and

no distress may be levied against the property to which the order applies
except with the leave of the Court and subject to any terms the Court
may impose.

Where the Court is satisfied that a freezing order has been applied for or
(2)
made in respect of any property in respect of which proceedings are pending, it
may stay the proceedings or allow them to continue on any terms it thinks fit.

Where a freezing order applies to a tenancy of any premises, no landlord
(3)
or other person to whom rent is payable may exercise the right of forfeiture in
relation to the premises in respect of any failure by the tenant to comply with any
term or condition of the tenancy, except with the leave of the Court and subject
to any terms the Court may impose.

The Court shall, before exercising any power conferred by this section,
(4)
give the parties to any of the proceedings concerned, where a receiver is appointed
under section 87, the receiver, and any person who may be affected by the Court’s
decision an opportunity to be heard.

Receivers may be appointed in respect of freezing orders

87.(1)
Where  the  Court  makes  a  freezing  order,  the  Court  may,  on  the
application of the Recovery Authority, whether at the time of the application for
the freezing order or at any time afterwards, appoint a receiver in respect of any
property to which the freezing order applies.

An  application  for  the  appointment  of  a  receiver  may  be  made  without
(2)
notice  where  the  circumstances  are  such  that  notice  of  the  application  would
prejudice any right of the Recovery Authority to obtain a recovery order in respect
of any property to which the order relates.

(3)

The Court may, by order, authorise or require the receiver

106

(a)

(b)

(c)

to exercise any of the powers specified in subsection (4) in relation to
any property in respect of which the receiver is appointed;

to take any other measures the Court thinks appropriate in connection
with  the  management  of  any  such  property,  including  securing  the
detention, custody or preservation of the property in order to manage
it; and

where the Recovery Authority so requests in its application, to take any
measures which the Court considers necessary to establish whether or
not

(i)

(ii)

the property to which the order applies is recoverable property or
associated property; or

any other property is recoverable property in relation to the same
unlawful conduct and, if it is, who holds it.

(4)

The powers referred to in subsection (3)(a) are power to

(a)

(b)

(c)

seize the property to which the order applies;

obtain information or require a person to answer any question;

enter any premises to which the order applies and to

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

carry out a search for or inspection of anything described in the
order;

make or obtain a copy, photograph or other record of anything so
described; and

remove anything which he is required to take possession of in
pursuance of the order or which may be required as evidence in
the proceedings under this Part,

and  the  order  by  which  the  power  is  granted  may  describe  anything
generally, whether by reference to a class or otherwise;

107

(d)

manage any property to which the order applies including power

(i)

(ii)

to sell or otherwise dispose of assets comprised in the property
which are perishable or which ought to be disposed of before their
value diminishes;

where  the  property  comprises  assets  of  a  trade  or  business,  to
carry on, or arrange for another to carry on, the trade or business;
and

(iii)

to incur capital expenditure in respect of the property.

(5)

For the purpose of subsection (4)(b)

(a)

(b)

a requirement imposed in the exercise of the power has effect in spite
of any restriction on the disclosure of information, however imposed;
and

a statement made by a person in pursuance of such a requirement may
not be used in evidence against him in criminal proceedings, other than
proceedings for

(i)

an offence under the Perjury Act, Cap. 142; or

(ii)

another  offence  where,  in  giving  evidence,  the  person  makes  a
statement inconsistent with that previous statement.

A statement may not be used by virtue of subsection (5)(b)(ii) against a

(6)
person unless

(a)

(b)

evidence relating to it is adduced; or

a question relating to it is asked,

by or on behalf of the person in the proceedings.

(7)

An order making any provision under

(a)

subsection  (4)(b)  or  (c)  shall  include  provision  in  respect  of  legal
professional privilege;

108

(b)

subsection (4)(c) may require any person to give the receiver

(i)

(ii)

access to any premises which the receiver may enter in pursuance
of subsection (4)(c); and

any  assistance  the  receiver  may  require  for  taking  the  steps
mentioned in subsection (4)(c).

The Court may, by order, require any person in respect of whose property

(8)
the receiver is appointed to

(a)

(b)

(c)

bring the property to a place specified by the receiver or to place it in
the custody of the receiver;

do  anything  he  is  reasonably  required  to  do  by  the  receiver  for  the
preservation of the property; and

bring  any  documents  relating  to  the  property  which  are  in  his
possession or control to a place specified by the receiver or to place
them in the custody of the receiver.

Any prohibition on dealing with property imposed by a freezing order does
(9)
not prevent a person from complying with any requirements imposed by virtue
of this section.

The  Recovery  Authority  may,  in  its  application  for  an  order  under  this

(10)
section, nominate a suitably qualified person for appointment as a receiver.

The  Recovery  Authority  may  apply  a  sum  received  by  it  under  section
(11)
100(2)  in  making  payment  of  the  remuneration  and  expenses  of  a  receiver
appointed under this section.

Supervision of receiver appointed in respect of freezing order

88.(1)
Any of the following persons may apply to the Court for directions as
to the exercise of the functions of a receiver appointed in respect of a freezing
order:

(a)

the receiver;

109

(b)

any party to the proceedings for the appointment of the receiver or the
freezing order concerned;

(c)

any person affected by action taken by the receiver; and

(d)

any person who may be affected by action the receiver proposes to take.

The Court shall, before giving any directions under subsection (1), give an

(2)
opportunity to be heard to

(a)

(b)

(c)

the receiver;

the parties to the proceedings for the appointment of the receiver and
for the freezing order concerned; and

any person who may be interested in the application under subsection
(1).

Receiver appointed in respect of freezing order not liable for certain
action

89.

Where

(a)

(b)

the receiver deals with any property which is not property in respect of
which he is appointed; and

at the time he deals with the property he believes on reasonable grounds
that he is entitled to do so by virtue of his appointment, the receiver is
not liable to any person in respect of any loss or damage resulting from
his dealing with the property except so far as the loss or damage is
caused by his negligence.

Variation or setting aside of order appointing receiver in respect of
freezing order

90.(1)
The Court may at any time vary or set aside any order appointing a
receiver  under  section  87  or  any  other  order  made  under  that  section  or  any
directions given under section 88.

110

The Court shall, before exercising any power under subsection (1), give

(2)
an opportunity to be heard to

(a)

(b)

the receiver;

the parties to the proceedings for the appointment of the receiver under
section 87 or any other order under that section or, as the case may be,
for directions under section 88;

(c)

the parties to the proceedings for the freezing order concerned; and

(d)

any person who may be affected by the Court’s decision.

Reporting by receiver

91.
receiver shall

Where  a  receiver  is  appointed  in  respect  of  a  freezing  order,  the

(a)

inform the Recovery Authority and the Court as soon as reasonably
practicable where he thinks that

(i)

any property to which the order applies by virtue of a claim that
it is

(A)

recoverable property, is not recoverable property; or

(B)

associated property, is not associated property;

(ii)

any  property  to  which  the  order  does  not  apply  is  recoverable
property  (in  relation  to  the  same  unlawful  conduct)  or  is
associated property;

(iii)

any property to which the order applies is held by a person who
is different from the person it is claimed holds it; or

(iv)

there has been any other material change of circumstances;

(b)

report his findings to the Court; and

111

(c)

serve copies of his report on the Recovery Authority and on any person
who  holds  any  property  to  which  the  order  applies  or  who  may
otherwise be affected by the report.

Vesting and Realisation of Recoverable Property

Making of recovery order

Where in proceedings under this Part the Court is satisfied that any
92.(1)
property  is  recoverable  property,  the  Court  shall  make  an  order  vesting  the
property in a recovery trustee.

The Recovery Authority may nominate a suitably qualified person to be

(2)
appointed as the recovery trustee in respect of a recovery order.

The Court shall not make in a recovery order any provision in respect of

(3)
any recoverable property where

(a)

(b)

each of the conditions in subsection (4) is met; and

it would not be just and equitable to do so.

(4)

The conditions referred to in subsection (3)(a) are that

(a)

(b)

the respondent obtained the recoverable property in good faith;

the respondent

(i)

(ii)

took any action, or omitted to take any action, after obtaining the
property which he would not have taken, or omitted to take, if he
had not obtained the property; or

took any action, or omitted to take any action, before obtaining the
property, which he would not have taken, or omitted to take, if he
had not believed he was going to obtain the property;

(c)

when the respondent took, or omitted to take, the action referred to in
paragraph (b), he had no notice that the property was recoverable; and

112

(d)

if a recovery order were made in respect of the property, it would, by
reason of his action or omission be detrimental to him.

(5)
In deciding whether, under subsection (3), it would not be just and equitable
to make in a recovery order any provision in respect of any recoverable property
where the conditions in subsection (4) are met, the Court shall have regard to

(a)

(b)

the degree of detriment that would be suffered by the respondent if the
provision were made; and

the Recovery Authority’s interest in receiving the realised proceeds of
the recoverable property.

(6)

The Court may in a recovery order

(a)

(b)

(c)

sever any property;

impose conditions as to the manner in which a recovery trustee may
deal with any property vested by the order for the purpose of realising
it; and

provide for payment under section 100 of reasonable legal expenses
that  a  person  has  reasonably  incurred,  or  may  reasonably  incur,  in
respect of

(i)

the proceedings under this Part in which the order is made; or

(ii)

any related proceedings under this Part.

(7)

This section is subject to sections 93 to 100.

Functions of the Recovery Trustee under Part III

93.(1)

The functions of a recovery trustee are:

(a)

(b)

to secure the detention, custody or preservation of any property vested
in him by a recovery order;

in the case of property other than money, to realise the value of the
property for the benefit of the Recovery Authority;

113

(c)

to otherwise give effect to the recovery order; and

(d)

to perform any other functions conferred on him by virtue of this Part.

(2)
In  performing  his  functions,  a  recovery  trustee  acts  on  behalf  of  the
Recovery Authority and shall comply with any directions given to him by the
Recovery Authority.

A recovery trustee shall realise the value of property vested in him by the
(3)
recovery order, so far as practicable, in the manner best calculated to maximise
the amount payable to the Recovery Authority.

(4)

A recovery trustee has the power

(a)

(b)

to sell the property or any part of it or interest in it;

to incur expenditure for the purpose of

(i)

(ii)

acquiring any part of the property, or any interest in it, which is
not vested in him; or

discharging any liabilities, or extinguishing any rights, to which
the property is subject;

(c)

to manage the property including power

(i)

(ii)

to sell or otherwise dispose of assets comprised in the property
which are perishable or which ought to be disposed of before their
value diminishes;

where  the  property  comprises  assets  of  a  trade  or  business,  to
carry on, or arrange for another to carry on, the trade or business;
and

(iii)

to incur capital expenditure in respect of the property;

(d)

(e)

to initiate, carry on or defend any legal proceedings in respect of the
property;

to make any compromise or other arrangement in connection with any
claim relating to the property; and

114

(f)

for the purposes of, or in connection with, the exercise of any of his
other powers

(i)

by his official name to

(A)

hold property;

(B)

enter into contracts;

(C)

sue and be sued;

(D)

employ agents; and

(E)

execute a power of attorney, deed or other instrument; and

(ii)

to do any other act which is necessary or expedient.

A reference in this section to a recovery order includes a consent order
(5)
made under section 98 and a reference to property vested in a recovery trustee
by a recovery order includes property vested in him pursuant to such a consent
order.

Rights of pre-emption

A recovery order shall have effect in relation to any property despite
94.(1)
any provision, of whatever nature, which would otherwise prevent, penalise or
restrict the vesting of the property.

A right of pre-emption, right of return or other similar right does not operate
(2)
or become exercisable as a result of the vesting of any property under a recovery
order.

In subsection (2), “right of return” means any right under a provision for

(3)
the return or reversion of property in specified circumstances.

Where property is vested under a recovery order, any right referred to in
(4)
subsection (2) shall have effect as if the person in whom the property is vested
were the same person in law as the person who held the property and as if no
transfer of the property had taken place.

115

References to rights in subsections (2), (3) and (4) do not include any rights

(5)
in respect of which the recovery order was made.

(6)
This section applies in relation to the creation of interests, or the doing of
anything  else,  by  a  recovery  order,  as  it  applies  in  relation  to  the  vesting  of
property.

Associated and joint property

95.(1)
Sections 96 and 97 apply where the Court makes a recovery order in
respect  of  any  recoverable  property  in  any  of  the  circumstances  set  out  in
subsection (2).

(2)

The circumstances referred to in subsection (1) are where

(a)

the property to which the proceedings relate includes property which
is associated with the recoverable property and is specified or described
in  the  application  and,  where  the  associated  property  is  not  the
respondent’s property, the application for the recovery order

(i)

has been served on the person whose property it is; or

(ii)

the Court has dispensed with service; or

(b)

the recoverable property belongs to joint tenants and one of the tenants
is an excepted joint owner.

For the purposes of this Part “excepted joint owner” means a person who
(3)
obtained the property in circumstances in which it would not be recoverable as
against him and references to the excepted joint owner’s share of the recoverable
property are to so much of the recoverable property as would have been his if the
joint tenancy had been severed.

Agreements on associated and joint property

96.(1)

Where

(a)

this section applies; and

116

(b)

the Recovery Authority (on the one hand) and the person who holds
the associated property or who is the excepted joint owner (on the other)
agree,

the Court may, in the recovery order, instead of vesting the recoverable property
in a recovery trustee, require the person who holds the associated property or who
is the excepted joint owner to make a payment to the recovery trustee.

Where  in  a  recovery  order  the  Court  makes  any  requirement  under
(2)
subsection (1), the Court may, so far as required for giving effect to the agreement,
include provision for vesting, creating or extinguishing any interest in property.

The amount of the payment to be made under subsection (1) shall be the
(3)
amount which the Recovery Authority and the person agree represents, in the
circumstances specified in

(a)

(b)

section 95(2)(a), the value of the recoverable property; or

section 95(2)(b), the value of the recoverable property less the value
of the excepted joint owner’s share.

(4)

Where

(a)

(b)

a freezing order applied at any time to the associated property or joint
tenancy; and

the Recovery Authority agrees that the person has suffered loss as a
result of the freezing order,

the  amount  of  the  payment  may  be  reduced  by  any  amount  the  Recovery
Authority and the person agree is reasonable, having regard to the loss and to any
other relevant circumstances.

(5)

Where there is more than one

(a)

(b)

such item of associated property; or

excepted joint owner,

117

the total amount to be paid to the recovery trustee, and the part of that amount
which is to be provided by each person who holds any such associated property
or who is an excepted joint owner, is to be agreed between both, or all, of them
and the Recovery Authority.

Where  in  a  recovery  order  the  Court  makes  any  requirement  under
(6)
subsection (1), the Court shall make provision for any recoverable property to
cease to be recoverable.

Absence of agreement on associated and joint property

97.(1)
in subsections (2) to (6) where

Where this section applies, the Court may make the provision set out

(a)

(b)

there is no agreement under section 96; and

the Court thinks it just and equitable to do so.

(2)

The Court may provide in the recovery order for

(a)

the associated property to vest in the recovery trustee or, as the case
may be, the excepted joint owner’s interest to be extinguished; or

(b)

the excepted joint owner’s interest to be severed.

Where the Court makes in a recovery order any provision under subsection

(3)
(2)(a) the Court may provide for either or both of the following:

(a)

(b)

for the recovery trustee to pay an amount to the person who holds the
associated property or who is an excepted joint owner;

for the creation of interests in favour of that person, or the imposition
of  liabilities  or  conditions,  in  relation  to  the  property  vested  in  the
recovery trustee.

The  Court  shall,  in  making  any  provision  in  a  recovery  order  under

(4)
subsection (2) or (3), have regard to

(a)

the rights of any person who holds the associated property or who is
an excepted joint owner and the value to him of that property or, as the

118

case may be, of his share, including any value which cannot be assessed
in terms of money; and

(b)

the Recovery Authority’s interest in receiving the realised proceeds of
the recoverable property.

(5)

Where

(a)

(b)

a freezing order applied at any time to the associated property or joint
tenancy; and

the Court is satisfied that the person who holds the associated property
or who is an excepted joint owner has suffered loss as a result of the
freezing order,

the Court may, in making any provision by virtue of subsection (2) or (3) in a
recovery  order,  require  the  Recovery  Authority  to  pay  compensation  to  that
person.

The amount of compensation to be paid under subsection (5) is the amount
(6)
the Court thinks reasonable, having regard to the person’s loss and to any other
relevant circumstances.

Consent orders

98.(1)
The Court may make an order staying any proceedings for a recovery
order on terms agreed by the parties for the disposal of the proceedings where
each person to whose property the proceedings, or the agreement, relates is a
party both to the proceedings and the agreement.

An order under subsection (1) may, in addition to staying the proceedings,

(2)
make

(a)

provision for any property which may be recoverable property to cease
to be recoverable; and

(b)

any further provision which the Court thinks appropriate.

119

(3)
Section 100 applies to property vested in a recovery trustee, or money paid
to him, pursuant to an agreement referred to in subsection (1) as it applies to
property vested in him by a recovery order or money paid under section 96.

Limit on recovery

99.(1)
order in respect of

This section applies where the Recovery Authority seeks a recovery

(a)

(b)

both  property  which  is  or  represents  property  obtained  through
unlawful conduct or tainted property, and related property; or

property  which  is  or  represents  property  obtained  through  unlawful
conduct, or tainted property, where such an order, or an order under
section 98, has previously been made in respect of related property.

(2)

For the purposes of this section

(a)

(b)

“the original property” means the property obtained through unlawful
conduct or the tainted property, as the case may be; and

the original property, and any items of property which represent the
original property, are to be treated as related to each other.

The Court shall not make a recovery order where it thinks that the Recovery
(3)
Authority’s right to recover the original property has been satisfied by a previous
recovery order or an order under section 98.

Subject to subsection (3), the Court may act under subsection (5) where it

(4)
thinks that

(a)

(b)

a recovery order may be made in respect of 2 or more related items of
recoverable property; but

the making of a recovery order in respect of both or all of the related
items is not required in order to satisfy the Recovery Authority’s right
to recover the original property.

120

(5)
The  Court  may,  in  order  to  satisfy  the  right  of  the  Recovery  Authority
referred to in subsection (4)(a) to the extent required, make a recovery order in
respect of either or both of the following:

(a)

(b)

only some of the related items of property;

only a part of any of the related items of property.

Where the Court may make a recovery order in respect of any property,
(6)
this section does not prevent the recovery of any profits which have accrued in
respect of the property.

(7)

Where

(a)

(b)

an order is made under section 114, 125 or 128 for the forfeiture of
recoverable property; and

the Recovery Authority subsequently seeks a recovery order in respect
of related property,

the order under that section shall be treated for the purposes of this section as if
it were a recovery order obtained by the Recovery Authority in respect of the
forfeited property.

(8)

Where

(a)

(b)

an order is made under section 127 instead of an order being made
under section 125 for the forfeiture of recoverable property; and

the Recovery Authority subsequently seeks a recovery order in respect
of related property,

the order under section 127 shall be treated for the purposes of this section as if
it were a recovery order obtained by the Recovery Authority in respect of the
property that was the forfeitable property in relation to the order under section
127.

(9)

Where

121

(a)

(b)

(c)

pursuant to a judgment in civil proceedings, whether in Barbados or
elsewhere,  a  claimant  has  obtained  property  from  a  defendant  (“the
judgment property”);

the claim was based on the defendant’s having obtained the judgment
property or related property through unlawful conduct; and

the Recovery Authority subsequently seeks a recovery order in respect
of property which is related to the judgment property,

the judgment is to be treated for the purposes of this section as if it were a recovery
order obtained by the Recovery Authority in respect of the judgment property.

(10)

Where

(a)

(b)

a forfeiture order is made for the forfeiture of property that, but for the
order, would have been recoverable property; and

the Recovery Authority subsequently seeks a recovery order in respect
of related property,

the forfeiture order shall be treated for the purposes of this section as if it were a
recovery order obtained by the Recovery Authority in respect of the forfeited
property.

(11)

Where

(a)

property has been taken into account in determining the amount of a
person’s benefit from criminal conduct for the purpose of making a
confiscation order; and

(b)

the Recovery Authority subsequently seeks a recovery order in respect
of related property,

the confiscation order is to be treated for the purposes of this section as if it were
a recovery order obtained by the Recovery Authority in respect of the property
referred to in paragraph (a).

(12)

In subsections (10) and (11),

122

“forfeiture  order”  means  an  order  described  in  section  13(2)(b)  or  (c)  or  an

equivalent order under another enactment;

“confiscation order” means

(a)

(b)

an order described in section 13(2)(a); or

an equivalent order under another enactment,

and,  in  relation  to  an  order  specified  in  paragraph  (b),  the  reference  in
subsection (11)(a) to the amount of a person’s benefit from criminal conduct
is to be read as a reference to the corresponding amount under the enactment
in question.

Without  prejudice  to  any  other  circumstances  in  which  the  Recovery
(13)
Authority’s right to recover the original property may be satisfied, where there
is

(a)

(b)

a disposal, other than a part disposal, of the original property, and other
property  (“the  representative  property”)  is  obtained  in  its  place,  the
Recovery Authority’s right to recover the original property is satisfied
by  the  making  of  a  recovery  order  in  respect  of  either  the  original
property or the representative property.

a  part  disposal  of  the  original  property,  and  other  property  (“the
representative property”) is obtained in place of the property disposed
of, the Recovery Authority’s right to recover the original property is
satisfied by the making of a recovery order in respect of the remainder
of the original property together with either the representative property
or the property disposed of.

Compensation where freezing order made but property is not
recoverable or associated property

(3)
proceedings for a recovery order, subsection (2) applies to the application for the

be its equivalent in Barbados dollars at the prevailing rate of exchange.

Searches for recoverable cash

109.(1)

A law enforcement officer who

(a)

(b)

is lawfully on any premises; and

has reasonable grounds for suspecting that there is recoverable cash on
the premises,

may search for the cash on the premises.

129

Where a law enforcement officer has reasonable grounds for suspecting

(2)
that a person (“the suspect”) is carrying recoverable cash, the officer may

(a)

so  far  as  he  thinks  it  necessary  or  expedient,  require  the  suspect  to
permit a search of

(i)

any article the suspect has with him; and

(ii)

his person; and

(b)

for the purposes of exercising his power under paragraph (a)(ii), detain
the suspect for so long as is necessary for the exercise of that power.

(3)

The powers conferred by this section are exercisable

(a)

(b)

only so far as reasonably required for the purpose of finding the cash;
and

by a law enforcement officer who is a customs officer only where he
has reasonable grounds to believe that the unlawful conduct in question

(4)

This section does not require a person to submit to an intimate search.

110.
grounds for suspecting that

A law enforcement officer may seize cash where he has reasonable

(a)

(b)

the cash is recoverable cash; or

part of the cash is recoverable cash and it is not reasonably practicable
to seize only that part.

Detention of seized cash

111.(1)
Where a law enforcement officer who has seized cash under section
110 continues to have reasonable grounds for his suspicion, the cash seized under
that section may be detained initially for a period of 72 hours.

130

(2)
The period for which the cash or any part of it may be detained may be
extended by a magistrate by order, but the order may not authorise the detention
of any of the cash

(a)

(b)

beyond the end of the period of 3 months beginning with the date of
the order; or

in the case of any further order under this section, beyond the end of
the period of 2 years beginning with the date of the first order.

An application for an order under subsection (2) may be made by a senior
(3)
law  enforcement  officer,  and  the  magistrate  may  make  the  order  where  he  is
satisfied, in relation to any cash to be further detained, that there are reasonable
grounds for suspecting that the cash is

(a)

recoverable cash and that

(i)

its continued detention is justified while its derivation is further
investigated  or  consideration  is  given  to  bringing  proceedings,
whether in or outside Barbados, against any person for an offence
with which the cash is connected; or

(ii)

proceedings against any person for an offence with which the cash
is connected have been instituted and have not been concluded; or

(b)

intended to be used in unlawful conduct and that

(i)

its continued detention is justified while its intended use is further

whether  in  Barbados  or  elsewhere,  against  any  person  for  an
offence with which the cash is connected; or

(ii)

proceedings against any person for an offence with which the cash
is connected have been instituted and have not been concluded.

131

(4)
Where  an  application  for  an  order  under  subsection  (2)  relates  to  cash
seized  under  section  110(b),  the  magistrate  may  make  the  order  where  he  is
satisfied that

(a)

(b)

subsection (3)(a) or (b) applies in respect of part of the cash; and

it is not reasonably practicable to detain only that part.

An order under subsection (2) shall provide for notice to be given to any

(5)
person affected by it.

Interest on detained cash

Where cash is detained under section 111 for more than a period of
112.(1)
72 hours, the cash shall, at the first opportunity, be paid by the law enforcement
officer into an interest-bearing account and held there, and the interest accruing
on it is to be added to it on its forfeiture or release.

In the case of cash detained under section 111 which was seized under
(2)
section 110(b), the law enforcement officer, shall as soon as practicable after
paying the cash seized into an interest-bearing account, release the part of the
cash to which the suspicion does not relate.

Subsection (1) does not apply where the cash or, as the case may be, the
(3)
part  to  which  the  suspicion  relates,  is  required  as  evidence  of  an  offence  or
evidence in proceedings under this Division.

Release of detained cash

113.(1)
Where cash is detained under section 111, a magistrate may order the
release of the whole or any part of the cash where the magistrate is satisfied, on
an application by the person from whom the cash was seized, that the grounds
for the detention of the cash specified in section 111(3) or (4) are no longer met
in relation to the cash to be released.

The Commissioner of Police or the Comptroller of Customs, as the case
(2)
may be, or an authorised representative of either functionary may, after notifying
the magistrate under whose order cash is being detained or where that magistrate

132

is unavailable, another magistrate, release the whole or any part of the cash where
he is satisfied that the detention of the cash to be released is no longer justified.

Making of cash forfeiture order

114.(1)
Where cash is detained under section 111, a police officer may apply
to a magistrate for an order for the forfeiture of the whole or any part of the cash.

The magistrate may order the forfeiture of the cash, or any part of it, where

(2)
he is satisfied that the cash or the part of the cash is

(a)

(b)

recoverable cash; or

intended by any person for use in unlawful conduct.

In the case of recoverable cash which belongs to joint proprietors, one of
(3)
whom is an excepted joint owner, the order shall not apply to so much of the cash
as the magistrate thinks is attributable to the excepted joint owner’s share.

Where  an  application  for  the  forfeiture  of  any  cash  is  made  under  this
(4)
section, the cash shall be detained (and may not be released under any power
conferred  by  this  Division)  until  any  proceedings  pursuant  to  the  application,
including any proceedings on appeal, are concluded.

Appeal against cash forfeiture order

115.(1)
Any party to proceedings for a cash forfeiture order who is aggrieved
by the making of the order or the decision of the magistrate not to make the order
may appeal to the Court.

(2)

An appeal under subsection (1) shall

(a)

be made within the period of 30 days commencing on the date on which
the order was made or the decision not to make the order was taken;
and

(b)

be by way of a rehearing by the Court which may make any order that
it considers appropriate.

133

Where the Court upholds an appeal against a cash forfeiture order, it may

(3)
order the release of the whole or any part of the cash.

Application of forfeited cash

116.
After the period within which an appeal under section 115 may be
made or, where a person appeals under that section, after the appeal has been
determined or disposed of, cash forfeited under section 114, and any accrued
interest on it, shall be paid into the Criminal Assets Recovery Fund.

Victims and other owners of cash

A person who claims that any cash, or any part of it, that is detained
117.(1)
under this Division belongs to him, may apply to the magistrate for the cash or
the part of it to be released to him.

An application under subsection (1) may be made in the course of detention

(2)
or forfeiture proceedings or at any other time.

(3)

Where, on an application, it appears to the magistrate that

(a)

(b)

the applicant was deprived of the cash to which the application relates,
or of property which the cash represents, by unlawful conduct;

the property the applicant was deprived of was not, immediately before
he was deprived of it, recoverable property; and

(c)

the cash belongs to him,

the magistrate may order the cash to which the application relates to be released
to the applicant.

The magistrate may order the cash to which an application relates to be

(4)
released to the applicant or to the person from whom it was seized where

(a)

the  applicant  is  not  the  person  from  whom  the  cash  to  which  the
application relates was seized;

(b)

it appears to the magistrate that the cash belongs to the applicant;

134

(c)

the magistrate is satisfied that the grounds specified in section 111(3)
or  (4)  for  the  detention  of  the  cash  are  no  longer  met  or,  where  an
application has been made under section 114, the Court decides not to
make an order under that section in relation to the cash; and

(d)

no objection to the making of an order under this subsection has been
made by the person from whom that cash was seized.

Compensation where cash detained but not forfeited

Where no cash forfeiture order is made in respect of any cash detained
118.(1)
under this Division, the person to whom the cash belongs or from whom it was
seized  may  make  an  application  to  a  magistrate  for  compensation  for  the
detention.

Where, for any period beginning with the first opportunity to place the cash
(2)
in an interest-bearing account after the initial detention of the cash for a period
of 72 hours, the cash was not held in an interest-bearing account while detained,
the magistrate may order an amount of compensation to be paid to the applicant.

The amount of compensation to be paid under subsection (2) is the amount
(3)
the magistrate thinks would have been earned in interest in the period in question
if the cash had been held in an interest-bearing account.

Where the magistrate is satisfied that, taking account of any interest to be
(4)
paid  under  section  112  or  any  amount  to  be  paid  under  subsection  (2),  the
applicant has suffered loss as a result of the detention of the cash and that the
circumstances  are  exceptional,  the  magistrate  may  order  compensation,  or
additional compensation, to be paid to him.

The amount of compensation to be paid under subsection (4) is the amount
(5)
the magistrate thinks reasonable having regard to the loss suffered and any other
relevant circumstances.

Compensation under this section shall be paid from the Criminal Assets

(6)
Recovery Fund.

135

Where a cash forfeiture order is made in respect only of a part of any cash

(7)
detained, this section has effect in relation to the other part.

asset on the premises,

may search for the listed asset on the premises.

Where a law enforcement officer has reasonable grounds for suspecting
(2)
that  a  person  (“the  suspect”)  is  carrying  the  seizable  listed  asset,  the  officer
may

(a)

so  far  as  he  thinks  it  necessary  or  expedient,  require  the  suspect  to

(i)

any article the suspect has with him; and

conduct; and

the value of it is not less than the value prescribed under section 120(5)

(3)
more than one item of property, this section applies as if the value of each item
were equal to the aggregate value of all of those items.

(4)
The references in subsection (3) to the value of an item are to be read as
including references to the value of part of an item where the power conferred
by subsection (2) is being exercised whether alone or in conjunction with the
power conferred by subsection (1).

Detention of seized property

Where  a  law  enforcement  officer  who  has  seized  property  under
122.(1)
section 121 continues to have reasonable grounds for his suspicion in relation to
the property, the property seized under that section may be detained initially for
a period of 72 hours.

The period for which the property or any part of it may be detained may
(2)
be  extended  by  a  magistrate  by  order,  but  the  order  may  not  authorise  the

section 120(5)(b); and

139

(c)

there  are  reasonable  grounds  for  suspecting  that  the  property  is
recoverable property and that

(i)

its continued detention is justified while its derivation is further
investigated  or  consideration  is  given  to  bringing  proceedings,
whether  in  Barbados  or  elsewhere,  against  any  person  for  an
offence with which the property is connected; or

(ii)

proceedings  against  any  person  for  an  offence  with  which  the
property  is  connected  have  been  instituted  and  have  not  been
concluded; or

(d)

there  are  reasonable  grounds  for  suspecting  that  the  property  is
intended to be used in unlawful conduct and that

(i)

its continued detention is justified while its intended use is further
investigated  or  consideration  is  given  to  bringing  proceedings,
whether  in  Barbados  or  elsewhere,  against  any  person  for  an
offence with which the property is connected; or

(ii)

proceedings  against  any  person  for  an  offence  with  which  the
property  is  connected  have  been  instituted  and  have  not  been
concluded.

it is not reasonably practicable to detain only that part.

Where an application for an order under subsection (2) is made in respect
(5)
of two or more items of property that were seized at the same time and by the

140

same person, this section applies as if the value of each item were equal to the
aggregate value of all of those items.

The references in subsection (5) to the value of an item are to be read as
(6)
including references to the value of part of an item where subsection (4) applies
in relation to one or more of the items in respect of which the application under
subsection (2) is made.

(7)
person affected by it.

(8)
second or subsequent order under this section.

Testing and safekeeping of property seized under section 121

123.

A law enforcement officer

(a)

(b)

may carry out, or arrange for the carrying out of, tests on any item of
property  seized  under  section  121  for  the  purpose  of  establishing
whether it is a listed asset; and

shall arrange for any item of property seized under section 121 to be
safely stored throughout the period during which it is detained under
this Division.

Release of detained property

124.(1)

the  release  of  the  whole  or  any  part  of  the  property  where  the  magistrate  is
satisfied, on an application by the person from whom the property was seized,
that the grounds for the detention of the property specified in section 122 are no
longer met in relation to the property to be released.

The Commissioner of Police or the Comptroller of Customs, as the case
(2)
may be, or an authorised representative of either functionary may, after notifying
the  magistrate  under  whose  order  property  is  being  detained  or,  where  that
magistrate is unavailable, another magistrate, release the whole or any part of the

141

property, where he is satisfied that the detention of the property to be released is
no longer justified.

Making of listed asset forfeiture order

125.(1)
Where property is detained under this Division, a police officer may
apply to a magistrate for an order for the forfeiture of the whole or any part of
the property.

The magistrate may order the forfeiture of the property, or any part of the

(2)
property, where he is satisfied that

(a)

(b)

the property or the part of the property is a listed asset; and

what is to be forfeited is recoverable property or intended by a person
for use in unlawful conduct.

An order under subsection (2) may provide for the payment under section
(3)
130 of reasonable legal expenses that a person has reasonably incurred, or may
reasonably incur, in respect of

(a)

(b)

the proceedings in which the order is made; or

any related proceedings under this Division.

Subsection  (1)  shall  cease  to  apply  on  the  transfer,  in  accordance  with

(4)
section 128(1), of an application made under this section.

(5)
Where an application for the forfeiture of any property is made under this
section, the property is to be detained (and may not be released under any power
conferred  by  this  Division)  until  any  proceedings  pursuant  to  the  application,
including any proceedings on appeal, are concluded.

Where the property to which the application relates is being detained under
(6)
this Division as part of an item of property, having been seized under section
121, subsection (5) shall be read as if it required the continued detention of the
whole of the item of property.

142

Associated and joint property in relation to listed assets

126.(1)

Sections 127 and 128 apply where

(a)

an application is made under section 125 in respect of property detained
under this Division;

(b)

the magistrate is satisfied that

(i)

the property is a listed asset; and

(ii)

all or part of the property is recoverable property or intended by a
person for use in unlawful conduct; and

(c)

there exists property that is associated with the property in relation to
which the magistrate is satisfied as mentioned in paragraph (b).

(2)

Sections 127 and 128 also apply where

(a)

an application is made under section 125 in respect of property detained
under this Division;

(b)

the magistrate is satisfied that

(i)

the property is a listed asset; and

(ii)

all or part of the property is recoverable property; and

(c)

the property in relation to which the magistrate is satisfied as mentioned
in paragraph (b) belongs to joint tenants and one of the tenants is an
excepted joint owner.

(3)

For the purpose of this Division,

“associated property” means, in relation to forfeitable property, property of any
of  the  following  descriptions,  including  property  held  by  a  respondent,
which is not itself the forfeitable property:

(a)

any interest in the forfeitable property;

143

(b)

(c)

(d)

any  other  interest  in  the  property  in  which  the  forfeitable  property
subsists;

where the forfeitable property is a tenancy in common, the tenancy of
the other tenant;

where the forfeitable property is part of a larger property, but not a
separate part, the remainder of the larger property,

and a reference to property being associated with forfeitable property shall
be construed accordingly;

“forfeitable property” means the property in relation to which the magistrate is

satisfied as mentioned in subsection (1)(b) or (2)(b), as the case may be.

Agreements on associated and joint property in relation to listed assets

127.(1)

Where

(a)

(b)

this section applies; and

the Recovery Authority (on the one hand) and the person who holds
the associated property or who is the excepted joint owner (on the other)
agree,

the magistrate may, instead of making a listed asset forfeiture order, make an
order  requiring  the  person  who  holds  the  associated  property  or  who  is  the
excepted joint owner to make a payment to such person as he may specify in the
order.

The amount of the payment to be made under subsection (1) shall, subject
(2)
to subsection (3), be the amount which the Recovery Authority and the person
agree represents, in the circumstances specified in

(a)

(b)

section 126(1), the value of the forfeitable property; or

section 126(2), the value of the forfeitable property less the value of
the excepted joint owner’s share.

144

(3)
The amount of the payment may be reduced where the Recovery Authority
agrees that the other party to the agreement has suffered loss as a result of the
seizure  of  the  forfeitable  property  and  any  associated  property  under  section
121 and its subsequent detention.

The reduction that is permissible under subsection (3) is such amount as
(4)
the parties to the agreement agree is reasonable having regard to the loss suffered
and any other relevant circumstances.

An order under subsection (1) may, so far as required for giving effect to
(5)
the  agreement,  include  provision  for  vesting,  creating  or  extinguishing  any
interest in property.

An  order  under  subsection  (1)  may  provide  for  the  payment  under
(6)
subsection (9) of reasonable legal expenses that a person has reasonably incurred,
or may reasonably incur, in respect of

(a)

(b)

the proceedings in which the order is made; or

any related proceedings under this Division.

For  the  purposes  of  section  77(2),  on  the  making  of  an  order  under
(7)
subsection (1), the forfeitable property shall be treated as if it had been forfeited.

Where there is more than one item of associated property or more than one
(8)
excepted joint owner, the total amount to be paid under subsection (1), and the
part of that amount which is to be provided by each person who holds any such
associated property or who is an excepted joint owner, is to be agreed between
both or all of them and the Recovery Authority.

An amount received under an order under subsection (1) shall be applied

(9)
as follows:

(a)

first, it must be applied in making any payment of legal expenses which
are  payable  under  this  subsection  in  pursuance  of  provision  under
subsection (6);

145

(b)

second,  it  must  be  applied  in  payment  or  reimbursement  of  any
reasonable costs incurred in storing or insuring the forfeitable property
and any associated property while it was detained under this Division;

(c)

third, it must be paid into the Criminal Assets Recovery Fund.

Absence of agreement on associated and joint property in relation to
listed assets

128.(1)
127, the magistrate

Where this section applies and there is no agreement under section

(a)

(b)

shall, where the value of the forfeitable property and any associated
property is equal to or more than such amount as may be prescribed by
the Minister by Order; and

may, where the value of the forfeitable property and any associated
property is less than such amount as may be prescribed by the Minister
by Order,

transfer the application for a listed asset forfeiture order to the Court.

Where an application is transferred to it, the Court may order the forfeiture
(2)
of the property to which the application relates, or any part of that property, where
it is satisfied that

(a)

(b)

the property or the part of the property is a listed asset; and

what is to be forfeited is recoverable property or intended by a person
for use in unlawful conduct.

An order under subsection (2) may include provision of the type that may

(3)
be included in an order made under section 125.

The Court may, in addition to making an order under subsection (2), make

(4)
an order for

(a)

the forfeiture of the associated property or, as the case may be, for the
excepted joint owner's interest to be extinguished; or

146

(b)

the excepted joint owner's interest to be severed.

(5)
Where the magistrate decides not to transfer an application referred to in
subsection (1), the magistrate may, in addition to making an order under section
125(2), make an order for

(a)

the forfeiture of the associated property or, as the case may be, for the
excepted joint owner's interest to be extinguished; or

(b)

the excepted joint owner's interest to be severed.

(6)

An order under subsection (4) or (5)

(a)

(b)

may be made only where the Court or the magistrate, as the case may
be, thinks it just and equitable to do so; and

shall provide for the payment of an amount to the person who holds
the associated property or who is the excepted joint owner.

In making an order under subsection (4) or (5), and including provision in
(7)
it by virtue of subsection (6), the Court or the magistrate, as the case may be,
shall have regard to

(a)

the rights of any person who holds the associated property or who is
an excepted joint owner and the value to that person of that property
or, as the case may be, of that person's share, including any value that
cannot be assessed in terms of money; and

(b)

the  interest  of  the  Recovery  Authority  in  realising  the  value  of  the
forfeitable property.

(8)

Where the Court or the magistrate, as the case may be, is satisfied that

(a)

the person who holds the associated property or who is the excepted
joint owner has suffered loss as a result of the seizure of the forfeitable
property and any associated property and its subsequent detention; and

(b)

the circumstances are exceptional, an order under subsection (4) or (5)
may require the payment of compensation to that person.

147

The amount of compensation to be paid under subsection (8) is the amount
(9)
the Court or the magistrate, as the case may be, thinks reasonable, having regard
to the person’s loss and to any other relevant circumstances.

Compensation to be paid under subsection (9) shall be paid in the same

(10)
way that compensation is to be paid under section 132.

Appeal against listed asset forfeiture order

129.(1)
against

(a)

(b)

Any party to proceedings for a listed asset forfeiture order may appeal

the making of the order under section 125 or128;

the decision not to make the order under section 125, unless the reason
that no order was made is that an order was instead made under section
127;

(c)

the decision not to make the order under section 128(5).

Subsection (1)(b) and (c) do not apply where the application for the order

(2)
under section 125 was transferred in accordance with section 128.

(3)

An appeal under subsection (1) shall

(a)

be made within the period of 30 days commencing on the date on which
the order was made or the decision not to make the order was taken;
and

(b)

be by way of a rehearing by the relevant court which may make any
order that it considers appropriate.

Where the relevant court upholds an appeal against a listed asset forfeiture
(3)
order, it may order the release of the whole or any part of the property involved.

Realisation of forfeited property and proceeds of realisation

After the period within which an appeal under section 129 may be
130.(1)
made or, where a person appeals under that section, after the appeal has been

148

determined or disposed of, the Recovery Authority shall realise the property, and
for the purpose, may appoint a suitably qualified person to do so on its behalf.

The realisation of property under subsection (1) shall be carried out, so far
(2)
as practicable, in the manner best calculated to maximise the amount obtained
for the property.

The proceeds of property realised under subsection (1) shall be applied as

(3)
follows:

(a)

(b)

(c)

first, they shall be applied in making any payment required to be made
under section 128(8);

second, they shall be applied in making any payment of legal expenses
which  are  payable  under  this  subsection  in  pursuance  of  provision
under section 125 or 127;

third, they shall be applied in making any payment or reimbursement
of  any  reasonable  costs  incurred  in  storing  or  insuring  the  property
whilst detained under this Division and in realising the property;

(d)

fourth, they shall be paid into the Criminal Assets Recovery Fund.

Where what is realised under section (1) represents part only of an item of
(4)
property seized and detained under this Division, the reference in subsection (3)
(c) to costs incurred in storing or insuring the property is to be read as a reference
to costs incurred in storing or insuring the whole of the item of property.

Victims and other owners of detained property

131.(1)
A person who claims that any property, or any part of it, that is detained
under this Division belongs to him, may apply to the magistrate for the property
or the part of it to be released to him.

An application under subsection (1) may be made in the course of detention

(2)
or forfeiture proceedings or at any other time.

149

(3)

Where, on an application, it appears to the magistrate that

(a)

the  applicant  was  deprived  of  the  property  to  which  the  application
relates,  or  of  property  which  the  property  represents,  by  unlawful
conduct;

(b)

the property the applicant was deprived of was not, immediately before
he was deprived of it, recoverable property; and

(c)

the property belongs to the applicant,

the magistrate may order the property to be released to the applicant.

The magistrate may order the property to which an application relates to

(4)
be released to the applicant or to the person from whom it was seized where

(a)

the applicant is not the person from whom the property to which the
application relates was seized;

(b)

it appears to the magistrate that the property belongs to the applicant;

(c)

the magistrate is satisfied that the grounds specified in section 122 for
the detention of the property are no longer met or, where an application
has been made for a listed asset forfeiture order, the court decided not
to make the order in relation to the property; and

(d)

no objection to the making of an order under this section has been made
by the person from whom that property was seized.

Compensation where property detained but not forfeited

132.(1)
Where no order under section 125, 127 or 128 is made in respect of
any  property  detained  under  this  Division,  the  person  to  whom  the  property
belongs or from whom it was seized may make an application to a magistrate for
compensation for the detention.

Where the magistrate is satisfied that the applicant has suffered loss as a
(2)
result of the detention of the property and that the circumstances are exceptional,
the magistrate may order compensation to be paid to him.

150

(3)
The amount of compensation to be paid under subsection (2) is the amount
the magistrate thinks reasonable having regard to the loss suffered and any other
relevant circumstances.

Compensation under this section shall be paid from the Criminal Assets

(4)
Recovery Fund.

Where a listed asset forfeiture order is made in respect only of a part of

(5)
any property detained, this section has effect in relation to the other part.

Unexplained wealth orders

135.(1)
A  judge  in  Chambers  may,  on  the  application  of  the  Recovery

136 is fulfilled, make an order requiring a person (“the respondent”) to provide
a statement

setting  out  the  nature  and  extent  of  the  respondent's  interest  in  the
property in respect of which the order is made;

explaining  how  the  respondent  obtained  the  property,  including,  in
particular, how any costs incurred in obtaining the property were met;
and

(c)

setting out such other information in connection with the property as
may be so specified.

153

(2)

An application for an unexplained wealth order

(ii)

specify or describe the property in respect of which the order is
sought; and

specify the person whom the Recovery Authority thinks holds the
property, and the person specified may include a person outside

the person to whom it is to be given; and

(iii)

the place at which it is to be given or, where it is to be given in
writing, the address to which it is to be sent; and

(b)

may,  in  connection  with  requiring  the  respondent  to  provide  the
statement, also require the respondent to produce documents of a kind
specified or described in the order.

A respondent against whom an unexplained order is made shall comply
(4)
with the requirements imposed by the order within such period as the judge may
specify,  and  different  periods  may  be  specified  in  relation  to  different
requirements.

A person who, in purported compliance with a requirement imposed by an

(5)
unexplained wealth order,

(a)

(b)

makes a statement that the person knows to be false or misleading in a
material particular; or

recklessly makes a statement that is false or misleading in a material
particular,

is guilty of an offence.

154

An offence under subsection (5) is punishable upon summary conviction

(6)
by

(a)

a  fine  of  $10,000  or  imprisonment  for  2  years,  or  both,  where  the
offender is an individual;

(b)

a fine of $50,000, where the offender is a body corporate.

Requirements for making of unexplained wealth order

136.(1)

The requirements referred to in section 135(1) are that

(a)

there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

the respondent holds the property;

the value of the property is more than such amount as may be
prescribed by the Minister by Order; and

the known sources of the respondent’s lawfully obtained income
would  have  been  insufficient  for  the  purposes  of  enabling  the
respondent to obtain the property; and

(b)

the respondent is a politically exposed person; or

(c)

there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that

(i)

(ii)

the  respondent  is,  or  has  been,  involved  in  unlawful  conduct,
whether in Barbados or elsewhere; or

a  person  connected  with  the  respondent  is,  or  has  been,  so
involved.

(2)

It does not matter for the purposes of subsection (1)(a)(i)

(a)

(b)

whether or not there are other persons who also hold the property;

whether the property was obtained by the respondent before or after
the commencement date.

(3)

For the purposes of subsection (1)(a)(iii)

155

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

regard is to be had to any mortgage, charge or other kind of security
that it is reasonable to assume was or may have been available to the
respondent for the purposes of obtaining the property;

it is to be assumed that the respondent obtained the property for a price
equivalent to its market value;

income is “lawfully obtained” where it is obtained lawfully under the
laws of the country from where the income arises;

“known” sources of the respondent’s income are the sources of income,
whether  arising  from  employment,  assets  or  otherwise,  that  are
reasonably ascertainable from information available at the time of the
making of the application for the order.

(4)

In subsection (1)(b), “politically exposed person” means

(a)

an individual who is, or has been entrusted with a prominent public
function  within  Barbados  or  by  an  international  organisation  or  a
country other than Barbados;

(b)

a family member of a person referred to in paragraph (a);

(c)

(d)

a  person  known  to  be  a  close  associate  of  a  person  referred  to  in
paragraph (a);

a person otherwise connected with a person referred to in paragraph
(a).

Where  the  property  in  respect  of  which  an  unexplained  wealth  order  is
(5)
sought comprises more than one item of property, the reference in subsection (1)
(a)(ii) to the value of the property is to the total value of those items.

Effect of unexplained wealth order in cases of non-compliance

137.(1)
Where the respondent fails, without reasonable excuse, to comply with
the  requirements  imposed  by  an  unexplained  wealth  order  in  respect  of  any

156

property before the end of the response period, the property shall be presumed
to be recoverable property for the purposes of any proceedings taken in respect
of the property under Part III, unless the contrary is shown.

(2)

The presumption in subsection (1) applies in relation to property

(a)

(b)

only so far as relating to the respondent’s interest in the property; and

only where the value of that interest is more than such amount as may
be prescribed under section 136(1)(a)(ii).

It is for the court hearing the proceedings under Part III in relation to which
(3)
reliance  is  placed  on  the  presumption  to  determine  the  matters  in  subsection
(2).

The  “response  period”  is  such  period  as  the  judge  may  specify  under
(4)
section 135(4) as the period within which the requirements imposed by the order
are to be complied with, or the period ending the latest, where more than one is
specified in respect of different requirements.

(5)

For the purposes of subsection (1)

(a)

(b)

subject to section 138, a respondent who purports to comply with the
requirements imposed by an unexplained wealth order is not to be taken
to have failed to comply with the order;

where an unexplained wealth order imposes more than one requirement
on a respondent, the respondent shall be taken to have failed to comply
with  the  requirements  imposed  by  the  order  unless  each  of  the
requirements is complied with or is purported to be complied with.

Where  an  unexplained  wealth  order  is  made  in  respect  of  property
(6)
comprising more than one item of property, the reference in subsection (2)(b) to
the value of the respondent’s interest in the property is to the total value of the
respondent’s interest in those items.

157

Effect of unexplained wealth order in cases of compliance or
purported compliance

138.(1)
This section applies where, before the end of the response period (as
defined by section 137(4)), the respondent complies, or purports to comply, with
the  requirements  imposed  by  an  unexplained  wealth  order  in  respect  of  any
property in relation to which the order is made.

Where a freezing order made under section 139 has effect in relation to the
(2)
property,  the  Recovery  Authority  shall  determine  what  enforcement  or
investigatory proceedings, if any, it considers ought to be taken in relation to the
property.

A determination under subsection (2) shall be made within the period of

(3)
60 days starting with the date of compliance.

Where  the  determination  under  subsection  (2)  is  that  no  further
(4)
enforcement  or  investigatory  proceedings  ought  to  be  taken  in  relation  to  the
property, the Recovery Authority shall notify the court of that fact as soon as
reasonably practicable, and in any event, before the end of the period of 60 days
mentioned in subsection (3).

Where no freezing order is in effect in relation to the property, the Recovery
(5)
Authority may, at any time, determine what, if any, enforcement or investigatory
proceedings it considers ought to be taken in relation to the property.

A  determination  under  this  section  to  take  no  further  enforcement  or
(6)
investigatory  proceedings  in  relation  to  any  property  does  not  prevent  such
proceedings being taken subsequently, whether as a result of new information or
otherwise, in relation to the property.

(7)

For the purposes of this section

(a)

the  respondent  complies  with  the  requirements  imposed  by  an
unexplained wealth order only if all of the requirements are complied
with;

158

(b)

(c)

references  to  the  date  of  compliance  are  to  the  day  on  which  the
requirements imposed by the order are complied with, or, where the
requirements are complied with over more than one day, the last of
those days; and

where an order requires the sending of information in writing to, or the
production  of  documents  at,  an  address  specified  in  the  order,
compliance with the order, so far as it relates to that requirement, occurs
when  the  written  information  is  received,  or  the  documents  are
produced, at that address,

and  in  paragraphs  (a)  to  (c)  references  to  compliance  include  purported
compliance.

In  this  section  “enforcement  or  investigatory  proceedings”  means  any

(8)
proceedings in relation to property taken under this Part or Part II or III.

Freezing orders and receivers in relation to unexplained wealth orders

Where a judge makes an unexplained wealth order in respect of any
139.(1)
property and the judge considers it necessary to do so for the purpose of avoiding
the  risk  of  any  recovery  order  that  might  subsequently  be  obtained  being
frustrated, the judge may, on the application of the Recovery Authority, by order
prohibit the respondent to the unexplained wealth order, and any other person
with an interest in the property, from in any way dealing with the property.

(2)

An application for a freezing order referred to in subsection (1)

(a)

(b)

(c)

shall  be  made  in  the  same  proceedings  as  those  in  which  the
unexplained wealth order is made;

may be combined in one document with the unexplained wealth order;
and

shall be made without notice where the application for the unexplained
wealth order is made without notice.

(3)

The court

159

(a)

(b)

may  at  any  time  vary  or  discharge  a  freezing  order  made  under
subsection (1); and

shall discharge a freezing order, so far as it has effect in relation to any
property, in each of the following 3 cases:

(i)

(ii)

the first case is where the applicable 72 hour period has ended
and a relevant application has not been made before the end of
that period in relation to the property concerned;

the second case is where a relevant application has been made
before the end of the applicable 72 hour period in relation to the
property concerned and proceedings on the application, including
any on appeal, have been determined or otherwise disposed of;
and

(iii)

the third case is where the court has received a notification in
relation to the property concerned under section 138(4).

(4)

For the purpose of subsection (3), “applicable 72 hour period” means

(a)

where  the  respondent  complies,  or  purports  to  comply,  with  the
requirements imposed by an unexplained wealth order before the end
of the response period, the period of 72 hours beginning with the day
after  the  day  on  which  the  period  of  60  days  mentioned  in  section
138(3) ends;

(b)

in any other case, the period of 72 hours beginning with the day after
the day on which the response period ends.

(5)
Section 138(7) applies for the purposes of subsection (4) in determining
whether a person complies, or purports to comply, with the requirements imposed
by  an  unexplained  wealth  order  and  when  such  compliance,  or  purported
compliance, takes place.

The  court  shall,  before  exercising  power  under  this  section  to  vary  or
(6)
discharge a freezing order, as well as giving the parties to the proceedings an

160

opportunity to be heard, give such an opportunity to any person who may be
affected by its decision.

Subsection  (6)  does  not  apply  where  the  court  is  acting  as  required  by

(7)
subsection (3)(b).

(8)

In this section

“relevant application” means an application for a restraint order, a freezing order

made under section 83(1) or the appointment of a receiver;

“response period” has the meaning specified in section 137(4).

Sections 85, 86, 87, 88, 89 and 90 apply in respect of a freezing order made
(9)
under subsection (1) and the appointment of a receiver in relation thereto, subject
to the modification set out in subsection (10) and such other modifications as
may be necessary, as those sections apply with respect to a freezing order made
under section 83(1) and the appointment of a receiver under section 87 in relation
to that order.

The  modification  referred  to  in  subsection  (9)  is  that  section  87(3)(a)

grounds for

(a)

suspecting, in the case of

(ii)

a criminal recovery investigation, that the person specified in the
application  has  benefited  from  his  criminal  conduct  or  that
property specified in the application is an instrumentality of an
offence;

A judge who makes an order under subsection (1) may, on the application
(5)
of Barbados Revenue Authority or the prosecutor, extend the period within which

Objection to disclosure of information

Barbados  Revenue  Authority  may  object  to  the  disclosure  of  any
150.(1)
information or document in respect of which an order under section 149 has been
made by certifying in writing that the information or document should not be
disclosed on the grounds that

(a)

Barbados  Revenue  Authority  is  prohibited  from  disclosing  the
information  or  document  by  any  bilateral  or  international  treaty,
convention or other agreement respecting taxation to which Barbados
is a signatory;

(b)

a privilege is attached by law to the information or document;

(c)

(d)

the  information  or  document  has  been  placed  in  a  sealed  package
pursuant to law or an order of a court of competent jurisdiction; or

disclosure  of  the  information  or  document  would  not  for  any  other
reason be in the public interest.

Where an objection to the disclosure of information or a document is made
(2)
under subsection (1) the objection may be determined on application by Barbados
Revenue Authority or the prosecutor to a judge in Chambers made not later than
14 days from the date of the objection.

A judge who is to determine an objection pursuant to subsection (2) may,
(3)
where he considers it necessary, examine the information or document in relation

175

to  which  the  objection  is  made  and  shall  grant  the  objection  and  order  that
disclosure of the information or document be refused where he is satisfied as to
any of the grounds mentioned in subsection (1).

An appeal lies from a determination under subsection (2) to the Court of
(4)
Appeal and shall be brought within 14 days from the date of the determination
appealed  from  or  within  such  further  time  as  the  Court  of  Appeal  considers
appropriate in the circumstances.

Evidential value of copies

Where any information or document is examined or provided pursuant
151.
to an order under section 149 the person by whom it is examined or to whom it
is provided or any officer or person authorised by Barbados Revenue Authority
for the purpose, may make or cause to be made one or more copies thereof and
any copy purporting to be certified by Barbados Revenue Authority to be a copy
made pursuant to this section is evidence of the nature and content of the original
information  or  document  and  has  the  same  probative  force  as  the  original
information or document would have had if it had been proved in the ordinary
way.

Further disclosure

152.
No person to whom information or documents have been disclosed or
provided  pursuant  to  an  order  under  section  149  shall  further  disclose  the
information or documents except for the purposes of the investigation in relation
to which the order was made and proceedings under this Act.

Disclosure of information and documents held by Government
departments

Notwithstanding any provision in this or in any other law, the Court
153.(1)
may  on  an  application  by  the  prosecutor  order  the  person  in  charge  of  any
Government department or statutory body to produce or furnish to the prosecutor
or any other person specified in the order any document or information which is
in his possession or under his control or to which he may reasonably have access

176

(not being a document readily available to the public), which the Court considers
relevant to any investigation into, or proceedings relating to, an offence alleged
or suspected to have been committed by any person.

Section  150  shall,  with  such  modifications  and  adaptations  as  the
(2)
circumstances may require, apply in respect of an order made under subsection
(1).

the property specified in the application, the question whether it
is an instrumentality of an offence or any question as to who holds
the property or the extent or location of it; and

(b)

is  likely  to  be  of  substantial  value,  whether  or  not  by  itself,  to  the
investigation for the purposes of which the warrant is sought.

In  the  case  of  a  civil  recovery  investigation,  material  falls  within  this

relates to the property specified in the application, the question whether
it is recoverable property or associated property, the question as to who
holds any such property, any question as to whether the person who
appears  to  hold  any  such  property  holds  other  property  which  is
recoverable property or any question as to the extent or location of any
property mentioned in this paragraph; and

(b)

is  likely  to  be  of  substantial  value,  whether  or  not  by  itself,  to  the

(9)
subsection where it cannot be identified at the time of the application but it

180

(b)

is likely to be of substantial value, whether by itself or together with
other  material,  to  the  investigation  for  the  purposes  of  which  the
warrant is sought.

(10)
material.

PART V

MISCELLANEOUS

Undertakings by Crown in respect of restraining orders and freezing
orders

The Court may, before making a restraining order or a freezing order,
155.(1)
require the Crown to give such undertakings as the Court considers appropriate
with respect to the payment of damages or costs, or both, in relation to the making
and execution of the order.

(2)

For the purposes of this section, in the case of

(a)

a  restraining  order,  the  prosecutor  may,  after  consultation  with  the
Attorney-General; and

(b)

a freezing order, the Recovery Authority may

on behalf of the Crown, give to the Court such undertakings with respect to the
payment of damages or costs, or both, as are required by the Court.

Registration of restraining order and freezing order

156.(1)
A copy of a restraining order or of a freezing order which affects lands,
tenements or hereditaments in Barbados shall be registered with the Registrar in
accordance  with  the  Registration  of  Judgments  Act,  Cap.  210,  and  with  the
Registrar of Titles.

181

(2)
An  order  referred  to  in  subsection  (1)  is  of  no  effect  with  respect  to
registered land unless it is registered as a charge under the Land Registration
Act, Cap. 229.

(3)
Where particulars of an order referred to in subsection (1) are recorded or
registered, as the case may be, in accordance with the Registration of Judgments
Act, Cap. 210 or the Land Registration Act, Cap. 229, a person who subsequently
deals with the property shall, for the purposes of section 157, be deemed to have
notice of the order at the time of the dealing.

Contravention of restraining order or freezing order

A person who knowingly contravenes a restraining order or a freezing
157.(1)
order by disposing of, or otherwise dealing with, property that is subject to the
order is guilty of an offence and is liable on conviction on indictment to

(a)

a fine of $100,000 or imprisonment for 5 years or both, in the case of
an individual; or

(b)

a fine of $500,000, in the case of a body corporate.

Where a restraining order or a freezing order is made against property and
(2)
the property is disposed of, or otherwise dealt with, in contravention of the order
and the disposition or dealing was not for sufficient consideration or not in favour
of a person who acted in good faith and without notice, the prosecutor or the
Recovery Authority, as the case may be, may apply to the Court for an order that
the disposition or dealing be set aside.

On  an  application  under  subsection  (2)  in  relation  to  a  disposition  or

(3)
dealing, the Court may set aside the disposition or dealing as from

(a)

(b)

the date on which the disposition or dealing took place; or

the date of the order and declare the respective rights of any persons
who acquired interests in the property on, or after the day on which the
disposition or dealing took place, and before the date of the order.

182

Enforcing payment

158.(1)
Where the Court orders a defendant to pay any amount under this Act,
the order shall have effect as if the amount were a fine imposed on the defendant
by the Court.

Where the whole or any part of the sum ordered to be paid is not paid when
(2)
required by the Court, the Court may in respect of a sum in default set out in the
first  column  of  the  Second  Schedule,  impose  a  term  of  imprisonment  not
exceeding  the  maximum  period  set  out  opposite  that  amount  in  the  second
column.

(3)

Where

(a)

a  warrant  of  commitment  is  issued  for  a  default  in  payment  of  an
amount ordered to be paid under this Act in respect of any offence or
offences; and

(b)

at the time the warrant is issued, the defendant is liable to serve a term
of custody in respect of the offence or offences,

the term of imprisonment to be served in default of payment of the amount shall
not begin to run until after the term mentioned in paragraph (b) has been served.

Where, under a power granted by this Act, the Court varies a confiscation
(4)
order  or  a  recovery  order  and  the  effect  is  to  reduce  the  maximum  period  of
imprisonment specified in this section

(a)

where, as a result, the maximum period of imprisonment is less than
the term of imprisonment imposed by the Court, the Court shall impose
a reduced term of imprisonment; or

(b)

where paragraph (a) does not apply, the Court may amend the term of
imprisonment imposed.

Where, under a power granted by this Act, the Court varies a confiscation
(5)
order or a recovery order and the effect is to increase the maximum period of

183

imprisonment specified in this section, the Court may on the application of the
prosecutor, amend the term of imprisonment imposed.

Where a defendant serves a term of imprisonment in default of paying any
(6)
amount due under a confiscation order or a recovery order, his serving that term
does not prevent the confiscation order or recovery order from continuing to have
effect, so far as any other method of enforcement is concerned.

This section applies in relation to confiscation orders and recovery orders
(7)
made by a court in its appellate jurisdiction as it applies in relation to confiscation
orders and recovery orders made by the Court and the reference in subsection (1)
to the Court shall be construed accordingly.

Regulations

The Minister may make regulations for giving effect to this Act and,
159.(1)
in particular, in respect of anything required or permitted to be prescribed by this
Act  and  may  make  different  provision  in  relation  to  different  persons,
circumstances or cases.

The Minister may, in regulations made under subsection (1), provide for a
(2)
breach  of  any  provision  of  the  regulations  to  be  an  offence  punishable  on
summary conviction by a fine of $10,000 or imprisonment for 2 years or both.

offences referred to in section 13(1)(a) and (b), 37(1)(a), 38(1)(a) and 68(1)(a),
respectively, was committed before the commencement date.

referred to in section 52(1)(a) or (b) as the case may be, was committed before
the commencement date.

(4)

Where the Court is determining whether section 16 applies to a defendant

(a)

(b)

conduct shall not form part of a course of criminal activity where any
of the offences referred to in section 16(2)(a) was committed before
the commencement date; and

conduct shall form part of a course of criminal activity notwithstanding
that any of the offences of which the defendant was convicted on at
least 2 separate occasions in the period referred to in section 16(2)(b)
was committed before the commencement date.

Notwithstanding the repeal of the former Act, the former Act applies as if
(5)
it had not been repealed where subsection (2) or (3) applies with respect to an
offence.
