PART IV

PROTECTION OF WHISTLEBLOWERS ETC.

No whistleblower shall be subjected to detrimental action on account
16.(1)
of  his  intending  or  attempting  to  make,  making  or  having  made,  a  protected
disclosure.

Subsection  (1)  applies  notwithstanding  any  duty  of  secrecy  or
(2)
confidentiality or other prohibition or restriction on the disclosure of information
under any enactment, rule of law, contract, oath or practice.

An employee who is dismissed on account of his intending or attempting
(3)
to make, making or having made, a protected disclosure shall, without prejudice
to  any  other  remedy,  be  treated  as  having  been  unfairly  dismissed  under  the
Employment Rights Act, 2012 (Act 2012-9).

Presumption of detrimental action resulting from disclosure

17.
Where  a  whistleblower  suffers  detrimental  action  at  or  around  the
same time that he makes a protected disclosure, the detrimental action shall be
presumed to be a consequence of the protected disclosure unless the person who
took, authorized or caused the detrimental action to be taken shows that the act
that constitutes the detrimental action is otherwise justified.

Immunity from civil, criminal and disciplinary proceedings

18.(1)
Subject to section 19, a whistleblower shall not be liable in any civil,
criminal  or  disciplinary  proceedings  on  account  of  his  making  a  protected
disclosure.

under any enactment, rule of law, contract, oath or practice.

19

The  protection  afforded  to  a  whistleblower  by  this  Part  shall  not  be

diminished or denied on the basis that

the  whistleblower  was  mistaken  about  the  significance  of  the
disclosure;

any perceived threat to the public interest on which the disclosure was
based has not materialised; or

the  whistleblower  has  not  fully  complied  with  any  applicable

whistleblower was the perpetrator of, or an accomplice in, any improper conduct

(a)

(b)

to which the disclosure relates; and

which constitutes an offence.

Subject to subsections (5) and (6), nothing in this Part shall prevent the
(2)
institution of civil or disciplinary proceedings against a whistleblower where the

protected disclosure.

In any criminal proceedings instituted against a whistleblower on the basis
(3)
that the whistleblower was the perpetrator of, or an accomplice in, the improper
conduct disclosed by the whistleblower, the court shall, in giving its judgment or
decision, take into due account

(a)

(b)

the fact that the disclosure was made by the whistleblower; and

whether the whistleblower has assisted members of the Police Force
in apprehending any other person involved in the commission of an
offence,

20

and the punishment of the whistleblower may be mitigated or remitted as the
court thinks fit.

Where the court acts under subsection (3), the court shall expressly refer

(4)
to that subsection in its judgment or decision.

In any civil proceedings instituted against a whistleblower on the basis that
(5)
the whistleblower was the perpetrator of, or was an accomplice in, the improper
conduct disclosed by the whistleblower, the court may, where it finds that the
whistleblower  is  responsible  for  the  payment  of  damages,  only  hold  the
whistleblower liable for such part of the damage as he may have caused and not
hold him liable jointly and severally with others.

Where a whistleblower is an employee of a public body and disciplinary
(6)
proceedings are instituted against him on the basis that he was the perpetrator of,
or an accomplice in, the improper conduct disclosed by him, the public body shall

(a)

(b)

endeavour to mitigate the effects of any punishment; and

where  possible,  not  seek  the  dismissal  of  the  whistleblower  as
punishment.

Prohibition of disclosure of information to identify whistleblower

20.(1)
No disclosure receiving officer or Disclosure Receiving Authority to
whom a protected disclosure is made or referred shall disclose information that
identifies,  or  may  lead  to  the  identification  of,  the  whistleblower,  unless  the
whistleblower expressly consents in writing to the disclosure of that information.

A  disclosure  receiving  officer  shall  not  communicate  the  contents  of  a
(2)
disclosure to any other person whether within or outside his organization that is
not  directly  involved  in  receiving,  inquiring  into  or  otherwise  dealing  with
disclosures, unless he first inquires into the disclosure and establishes that it is
necessary or expedient in the public interest for further investigation to be carried
out by the person or by members of the Police Force or any other body with
investigative,  prosecutorial  or  regulatory  powers  in  relation  to  any  improper
conduct which constitutes an offence or other breach of law.

21

(3)

The Disclosure Monitoring Authority may issue guidelines setting out

(a)

the  duties  of  communication  between  Disclosure  Receiving
Authorities and whistleblowers and the restrictions thereon; and

(i)

persons  within  Disclosure  Receiving  Authorities  who  are  not
directly involved in receiving, inquiring into or otherwise dealing
with disclosures; and

(ii)

other Disclosure Receiving Authorities.

the High Court for

and determine the amount of damages due to the whistleblower;

compensation  for  any  loss  or  damage  sustained  as  a  consequence  of  the
detrimental action.

22.
that, on account of his intending or attempting to make, making or having made
a  protected  disclosure,  he  has  been,  is  being,  or  is  likely  to  be,  subjected  to
detrimental action, to seek redress for such action under any other law.
