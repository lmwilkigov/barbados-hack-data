“DIVISION JA

CALCULATION OF ASSESSABLE INCOME FROM
QUALIFYING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

Income arising from the exploitation of intellectual property

With  effect  from  income  year  2024,  in  calculating  the
22A.(1)
assessable income of a person for an income year, the income of that
person earned in Barbados from qualifying intellectual property shall

5

be

determined

according

to

the

following

formula:

Subject  to  this  Act,  overall  income  for  an  income  year  from
(2)
qualifying  intellectual  property  is  the  profit  derived  from  qualifying
intellectual property for that income year.

Where an expenditure is not fully deductible in the income year
(3)
in  which  it  is  incurred  because  it  is  capitalised  or  otherwise,  such
expenditure shall be included in full in the nexus ratio starting in the
income year in which it is incurred.

In  calculating  income  from  qualifying  intellectual  property,  a
(4)
person  may  apply  “up-lift”  expenditures  which  shall  be  qualifying
expenditures increased by 30 per cent but only to the extent that the
person has non-qualifying expenditures.

Notwithstanding  subsection  (1),  a  person  may  apply  to  the
(5)
Commissioner in writing for permission to replace the nexus ratio with
a  “replacement  ratio”  which  is  in  accordance  with  the  arm’s  length
principle.

The  Commissioner  may  grant  the  permission  referred  to  in

(6)
subsection (5) only when

(a)

(b)

the nexus ratio referred to in subsection (1) is greater than
32.5 per cent; and

the replacement ratio is significantly greater than the nexus
ratio  because  of  exceptional  circumstances  beyond  the
control of the company.

The permission referred to in subsection (5) shall be valid for a
(7)
period of 5 income years, provided that the conditions mentioned in

6

subsection (6) continue to be met at the close of each of the income
years concerned.

The arm’s length principle referred to in subsection (5), shall be
(8)
deemed  to  have  been  met  where  the  conditions  made  or  imposed
between the two associated enterprises in their commercial or financial
relations  do  not  differ  from  those  which  would  be  made  between
independent enterprises.

In addition to records and books of accounts required to be kept
(9)
under  section  75,  for  the  purposes  of  determining  income  from
qualifying intellectual property, a company shall maintain all records,
books and documents evidencing

(a)

ownership and the right to exploit the qualifying intellectual
property;

(b)

qualifying expenditures and overall expenditures incurred;

(c)

(d)

overall  income  derived  from  the  qualifying  intellectual
property;

the  correlation  between  the  qualifying  expenditures  and
overall  expenditures  and  overall  income  derived  from
qualifying intellectual property; and

(e)

where the replacement ratio under subsection (5) applies

(i)

(ii)

qualifying  intellectual  property  benefiting  from  the
replacement ratio; and

overall  income  derived  from  qualifying  intellectual
property benefiting from the replacement ratio.

Where from the records kept by a company it is not possible to
(10)
determine the income or loss from qualified intellectual property, the
company shall pay tax at the rate specified under section 43 or 43A.

Group relief is a relief that allows the current trading losses of a

Determination of subsidiary company

23N.(1)
In determining, for the purposes of group relief, whether a
company is a 75 per cent subsidiary of another, the other company shall

owned directly by a body corporate for which a profit on the
sale of the shares would be a trading receipt; or

(c)

of any share capital which it owns directly or indirectly in a
body corporate not resident in Barbados.

Notwithstanding  that  any  time  a  company  is  a  75  per  cent
(2)

Losses which may be surrendered

23P.(1)

Where a surrendering company

(a)

(b)

incurs  a  trading  loss  in  income  year  2024  or  subsequent
income years, or

has trading losses brought forward from income years prior
to income year 2024 and such losses are in excess of $100
000 000,

the loss may be set off against the total profits of the claimant company
for the corresponding accounting periods of the claimant company.

Notwithstanding subsection (1), where a surrendering company
(2)
has  trading  losses  arising  from  qualifying  intellectual  property  in
income year 2024 or subsequent income years, the loss may be set off
against the total profits arising from qualifying intellectual property of
a claimant company for the corresponding accounting periods of the
claimant company.

The  reduction,  by  means  of  group  relief,  of  tax  payable  by  a
(3)
claimant company in an income year shall not exceed 50 per cent of the
amount of tax which would have been payable had the relief not been
granted.

The  accounting  period  of  a  company,  for  the  purpose  of
(4)
corporation  tax,  shall  begin  whenever  the  company  not  then  being
within the charge to corporation tax comes within the charge, whether
by the company becoming resident in Barbados or acquiring a source
of income, or otherwise.

15

An accounting period of a company shall end for the purpose of

(5)
corporation tax on the first occurrence of any of the following:

accounting period;

(b)

the end of the fiscal period of the company; or

(c)

the company ceasing to be within the charge to corporation
tax.

Corresponding accounting periods

For the purposes of group relief an accounting period of the
23Q.(1)
claimant company which falls wholly or partly within an accounting
period  of  the  surrendering  company  corresponds  to  that  accounting
period.

For  the  purposes  of  group  relief  an  accounting  period  is

(2)
calculated in the manner specified in the Eighth Schedule.

Companies joining or leaving group

23R.(1)
Group relief shall be given only if the surrendering company
and the claimant company are members of the same group throughout
the whole of the surrendering company's accounting period to which
the  claim  relates  and  throughout  the  whole  of  the  corresponding
accounting period of the claimant company.

Where on any occasion two companies become or cease to be
(2)
members of the same group then for the purposes of subsection (4), it
shall be assumed as respects each company that

(a)

on  that  occasion,  unless  a  true  accounting  period  of  the
company begins or ends then, an accounting period of the
company  ends  and  a  new  one  begins,  the  new  accounting
period  to  end  with  the  end  of  the  true  accounting  period,

16

unless  before  then  there  is  a  further  break  under  this
subsection; and

(b)

(c)

the losses of the true accounting period are apportioned to the
component accounting periods referred to in paragraph (a);
and

the amount of total profits for the true accounting period of
the company against which group relief may be allowed is
also apportioned to the component accounting periods.

An apportionment under subsection (2) shall be on a time basis
(3)
according  to  the  respective  lengths  of  the  component  accounting
periods  except  that,  if  it  appears  that  that  method  would  work
unreasonably or unjustly, such other methods shall be used as appears
to the Commissioner just and reasonable.

Where  the  one  company  is  the  surrendering  company  and  the
(4)
other company is the claimant company references in subsection (1) to
accounting periods shall be so construed, so that if the two companies
are  members  of  the  same  group  in  the  surrendering  company's
accounting period, they must under that section also be members of the
same  group  in  any  corresponding  accounting  period  of  the  claimant
company.

Relief obtainable once for the same amount

23S.(1)
Relief shall not be given more than once in respect of the
same amount, whether by giving group relief or by giving some other
relief, in any accounting period, to the surrendering company, or by
giving group relief more than once.

In  accordance  with  subsection  (1),  two  or  more  claimant
(2)
companies cannot, in respect of any one loss or other amount for which
group  relief  may  be  given,  and  whatever  their  accounting  periods
corresponding to that of the surrendering company, obtain in all more
relief  than  could  be  obtained  by  a  single  claimant  company  whose

17

corresponding accounting period coincided with the accounting period
of the surrendering company.

Aggregate of claim

23T.(1)
Subject to subsection (2), two or more claimant companies
may make claims relating to the same surrendering company, and to
the same accounting period of that surrendering company

Notwithstanding subsection (1) where the claimant companies
(2)
referred to in subsection (1) make claims, the aggregate of the claims
shall not exceed the amount of the loss surrendered by the surrendering
company.

Capital allowances

A claimant company shall only be eligible to claim group
23U.
relief  where  that  company,  has  first  claimed  all  its  available  capital
allowances.

Tax recovery

23V.
Where  the  Commissioner  discovers  that  any  group  relief
which  has  been  given  is  or  has  become  excessive,  he  may  make  an
assessment to corporation tax in the amount which ought in his opinion
to be charged.

(a)

(b)

any  company

A payment for group relief

(a)

(b)

shall not be taken into account in computing profits or losses
of either company for corporation tax purposes; and

shall not for the purposes of the Income Tax Act, Cap. 73, be

(2)
made  by  the  claimant  company  to  the  surrendering  company  in
pursuance  of  an  agreement  between  them  as  respects  an  amount
surrendered by way of group relief, being a payment not exceeding that
amount.”.
