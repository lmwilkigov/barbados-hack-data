ADDENDUM

  On the 4th day of April, 2019, the Cabinet agreed to the lease to The Maria Holder Memorial

Trust of a parcel of land situate at Upton in the parish of Christ Church in this Island containing

by  admeasurement  9,111.1  square  metres  or  thereabouts  for  the  construction  of  a  skatepark

for public use.

  On  the  9th day  of  May,  2019,  the  Cabinet  approved  the  introduction  into  Parliament

of a Resolution seeking approval for the lease.

  By Resolution No. 10/2019 published in the Ofﬁ cial Gazette on the 10th day of June, 2019

Parliament resolved that the parcel of land be leased to The Maria Holder Memorial Trust for

a term of 20 years with an option to renew for a further term of 20 years subject to terms and

conditions which included a lease back to the Crown.

  On the 22nd day of July, 2021, the Cabinet agreed to rescind its decisions of 4th April

and  9th  May,  2019  and  instead  agreed  to  lease  to  The  Maria  Holder  Memorial  Trust  the

parcel of land situate at Upton in the parish of Christ Church subject to terms and conditions

which include the grant of a licence to the Crown.

The approval of Parliament is therefore now sought for the rescission of the Resolution

passed in the House of Assembly on the 7th day of May, 2019 and in the Senate on the 31st day of

May, 2019 and assented to by the Governor-General on the 5th day of June, 2019 and published

in the Ofﬁ cial Gazette as Resolution No. 10/2019.
