Court where

(b)

any  person  is  charged  with  murder  in  circumstances
connected with the discharge of that person’s official duties;

offence mentioned in subsection (1) shall be heard by the High Court

a period of 72 hours has expired after the application for bail

give reasons in writing for his decision; and

give  a  copy  of  the  reasons  for  the  decision  to  the
defendant and the prosecution.

Where bail is granted by the High Court to a defendant in the
(6)
circumstances mentioned in subsection (5)(a) or (b), there shall be a
right of appeal by the prosecution to the Court of Appeal against the
decision of the Court.

7

(7)
An appeal to the Court of Appeal under subsection (6) shall be
heard by the Chief Justice or by a Justice of Appeal assigned by the
Chief Justice as is appropriate in the particular circumstances.”.

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

_______________________________________________________________________

Bail (Amendment) Bill, 2019
________________________________________________________________________

The Preamble
The  Preamble  would  provide  the  necessary  background  and  context  which  makes  it

necessary for section 13 (3) of the Constitution to be amended.

Clause 2

Paragraph  (a)  is  not  a  substantive  provision.  It  will  correct  a  numbering  error
since the provisions are sub-paragraphs but are wrongly numbered as paragraphs.
The correction will allow for the provisions to be correctly cited.

Paragraph  (b)  provides  a  new  ground  which  the  Court  must  consider  in
exercising its discretion to grant or withhold bail.

Clause 3
Clause  3  provides  for  the  insertion  of  a  new  section  which  restricts  the  grant  of  bail  to
persons charged with serious offences.

Subclause (1)
This provision prohibits the grant of bail to persons who are charged with any
of the offences specified in subsection (1) of the new section 5A until after the
expiration of 24 months following the bringing of charges.

Subclause (2)
This provision provides an exception in the case where a person is charged with

the offence of murder if the offence is committed when the person was carrying

out his official duties. The provision is widely drafted to prevent an injustice to

any person, including a security guard or a watchman who kills a person when

carrying out his lawful duties.

Subclause (3)
This provision provides for bail applications for serious offences to be heard by

the Chief Justice or by a Judge assigned by Chief Justice.

Subclause (4)
This  provision  modifies  the  practice  and  procedure  relating  to  bail  so  as  to

facilitate appeals by the prosecution.

Subclause (5)
This  provision  requires  the  court  to  give  reasons  for  bail  decisions  so  as  to
facilitate appeals by the prosecution.

Subclause (6)
This provision gives the Prosecution (and not the accused) a new right of appeal
to the Court of Appeal.
