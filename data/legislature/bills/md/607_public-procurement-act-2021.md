(c)

(d)

(e)

provision of the services, as the case may be;

the characteristics of the goods, works or services, such as functional
and environmental characteristics;

the terms of payment and of guarantees in respect of the goods, works
or services; and

where  relevant,  the  experience,  reliability  and  professional  and
managerial  competence  of  the  supplier  and  of  the  personnel  to  be
involved in providing the goods, works or services.

All  non-price  evaluation  criteria  shall,  to  the  extent  practicable,  be

(3)
objective and quantifiable.

(5)
section and section 19(2) shall be used in any evaluation under this Act.

Examination and evaluation of tenders

where the clarification would assist the entity in the examination and evaluation
of the tender.

A procuring entity shall correct purely arithmetic errors discovered during

supplier who presented the tender.

38

(3)
No change in a matter of substance in the tender, including a change in
price and a change aimed at making an unresponsive tender responsive, shall be
sought, offered or permitted.

(4)
Any items having a zero price shall be deemed to be included in the price
of other items except in the case of line-item bidding where a zero price shall be
considered a non-offer for the item.

A procuring entity shall regard a tender as responsive where it conforms

(5)
to all requirements set out in the solicitation document.

Notwithstanding subsection (5), a procuring entity may regard a tender as

(6)
responsive even where it contains

(a)

minor  deviations  that  do  not  materially  alter  or  depart  from  the
characteristics, terms, conditions and other requirements set out in the
solicitation document; or

(b)

errors  or  oversights  that  are  capable  of  being  corrected  without
touching on the substance of the tender,

and  any  such  deviations  shall  be  quantified,  to  the  extent  possible,  and
appropriately taken into account in the evaluation of the tender.

Notwithstanding subsection (6), where a specification states that an item
(7)
is critical to the functioning of the entire lot or procurement, the failure of such
critical item to be responsive shall be cause for the tender in respect of the entire
lot or procurement to be regarded as unresponsive.

(8)

A procuring entity shall reject a tender

(a)

where the supplier who presented the tender is not qualified or the entity
is obliged, under this Act, to exclude the supplier from participation in
public procurement;

(b)

where  the  supplier  who  presented  the  tender  does  not  accept  a

purpose of evaluating and comparing tenders, the tender prices of all tenders shall
be converted to the currency specified in the solicitation document according to
the rate set out in that document.

A procuring entity may, whether or not it has engaged in pre-qualification
(12)
proceedings, require a supplier who presented a tender that is determined to be
a successful tender to demonstrate or reconfirm his qualifications.

The  criteria  and  procedures  to  be  used  for  the  demonstration  or
(13)
reconfirmation of the qualifications of a supplier shall be set out in the solicitation
document.

Where a procuring entity has engaged in pre-qualification proceedings, the
(14)
criteria for confirming qualifications shall be the same as those used in the pre-
qualification proceedings.

Where  a  supplier  who  presented  a  successful  tender  is  requested  to
(15)
demonstrate or reconfirm his qualifications but fails to do so within 10 days of
the request, the entity shall reject the tender and shall

(a)

subject  to  section  35(2),  select  the  next  highest  ranked  tender  from
among those remaining valid; or

Separate opening, examination and evaluation of technical and
financial tenders

31.(1)
This section applies, in addition to section 30, where a procuring entity
intends to consider the financial aspects of tenders separately and only after the
completion  of  the  examination  and  evaluation  of  the  technical,  quality  and
performance characteristics of the tenders.

A  procuring  entity  shall,  before  it  requests  the  opening  by  the  tenders
(2)
committee of the financial tenders, examine and evaluate the technical, quality
and performance characteristics of tenders in accordance with the criteria and
procedures specified in the solicitation document.

The results of the examination and evaluation of the technical, quality and
(3)
performance characteristics of the tenders shall be immediately included in the
procurement record.

(4)

Where the technical, quality and performance characteristics of a tender

(a)

(b)

meet or exceed the relevant minimum requirements, the tender shall
be regarded as responsive;

fail to meet the relevant minimum requirements, the tender shall be
regarded as unresponsive and shall be rejected on that ground.

(5)

The procuring entity shall, in the case of

(a)

a responsive tender,

(i)

promptly communicate to the supplier who presented the tender,
the score of the technical, quality and performance characteristics
of his tender; and

(ii)

invite all such suppliers or their representatives to the opening, by
the tenders committee of the financial tenders; and

score of the technical, quality and performance characteristics of his tender and
the price of his financial tender shall

be  announced  to  the  persons  present  at  the  opening  of  the  financial
tenders; and

communicated, on request, to a supplier who was invited to, but was
not present or represented at, the opening of tenders.

The price of each corresponding financial tender referred to in subsection

(7)
(6) shall be included in the procurement record.

The procuring entity shall compare the financial aspects of the responsive
(8)
tenders and on that basis identify the successful tender in accordance with the
criteria and procedures set out in the solicitation document.

The successful tender shall be the tender with the best combined evaluation

(9)
in terms of

(a)

(b)

the criteria, other than price, specified in the solicitation document; and

the price.

Rejection of abnormally low tenders

32.(1)
A procuring entity may, subject to subsection (2), reject a tender where
the  entity  determines  that  the  price,  in  combination  with  other  constituent
elements  of  the  tender,  is  abnormally  low  in  relation  to  the  goods,  works  or
services to be procured and raises concerns with the entity as to the ability of the
supplier who presented the tender to perform the procurement contract.

42

A procuring entity shall not reject a tender pursuant to subsection (1) unless

(2)
the entity

(a)

(b)

requests in writing from the supplier details of the aspect of the tender
that gives rise to its concerns as to the ability of the supplier to perform
the procurement contract; and

takes account of any information provided by the supplier pursuant to
the request and of the information included in the tender but continues,
on the basis of all such information, to hold such concerns.

The decision of a procuring entity to reject the tender of a supplier pursuant
(3)
to  this  section  and  the  reason  for  the  decision  shall  be  communicated  to  the
supplier.

33.(1)
tender in respect of a procurement, the entity shall submit to the relevant tenders
committee  for  consideration,  the  evaluation  report  on  the  matter  and  a
recommendation that the tenders committee treat and accept as the successful
tender, the tender identified as such by the entity.

(2)

The tenders committee may

(a)

(b)

accept the recommendation of the procuring entity as to the successful
tender; or

where it does not accept the recommendation, subject to sections 29 to
32 and taking the evaluation report into account, make its own decision
as to which tender is the successful tender.

A determination as to the successful tender does not constitute acceptance

(3)
of the tender.

43

Successful tender notice and standstill period

34.(1)
Where the relevant tenders committee determines that a tender should
be  accepted  as  a  successful  tender,  the  procuring  entity  shall  dispatch

the successful tender at the end of the standstill period.

(2)

The successful tender notice shall include

(a)

(b)

the  name  and  address  of  the  supplier  who  presented  the  successful
tender;

the contract price or, where the successful tender was ascertained on
the basis of price and other criteria, the contract price and a summary
of  the  other  characteristics  of  the  tender  that  made  the  tender  the
successful tender; and

(c)

the duration of the standstill period.

The standstill period shall be at least 10 days from the date of dispatch of

(3)
the notice.

Where the means of dispatch of the notice is not expected to result in the
(4)
delivery of the notice to a supplier in less than 5 days, the entity shall extend the
standstill period for such additional period as the entity may consider appropriate
in the circumstances.

Notwithstanding subsection (1), no successful tender notice or standstill
(5)
period  is  required  where  the  entity  determines  that  urgent  public  interest
considerations require the procurement to proceed without a standstill period.

Where a supplier whose tender was unsuccessful so requests within 5 days
(6)
of notification of the successful tender, the entity shall, within 10 days of receipt
of  the  request,  communicate  to  the  supplier  the  reason  that  his  tender  was
unsuccessful.

44

Successful tender acceptance notice

35.(1)

where no standstill period is required, as soon as practicable after the successful
tender is determined, dispatch to the supplier who presented the successful tender,
a notice to be called a successful tender acceptance notice.

(2)
other communication in any form conveying acceptance of a successful tender
or the award of a procurement contract shall be issued unless

the  relevant  tenders  committee  determines  that  a  particular  tender
should be accepted as the successful tender; and

(iii)

any regulatory approvals required have been granted.

A procuring entity shall not be liable for the provision of goods, works or
(3)
services by a supplier who receives a successful tender acceptance notice or for
anything  done  by  the  supplier  in  connection  with  such  provision  unless  the
supplier, prior to the provision of the goods, works or services or the doing of
anything in connection with such provision, enters into a procurement contract
with the entity in accordance with this Act.

Negotiations

36.(1)
Where the relevant tenders committee determines that a tender should
be accepted as a successful tender, negotiations may be held with the supplier
who presented the tender.

Negotiations shall not relate to the price of the tender except where price

(2)
was not a factor in the evaluation.

(3)

Negotiations may relate to

45

(a)

minor  amendments  to  the  special  conditions  of  the  contract,  the
delivery or completion schedule or work plan or the technical details

and accurate record of the negotiations.

accepted  to  execute  a  procurement  contract  conforming  to  the  terms  and
conditions of the accepted tender

(a)

the  procuring  entity  and  the  supplier  shall  execute  the  procurement
contract  within  a  reasonable  period  after  the  successful  tender
acceptance notice is dispatched to the supplier; and

(b)

between  the  time  when  a  successful  tender  acceptance  notice  is
dispatched  to  the  supplier  and  the  execution  of  the  procurement

(c)

(d)

owing to a catastrophic event, there is an extremely urgent need for the

procurement  would  be  impractical  because  of  the  time  involved  in
using the method; or

the  entity  determines,  in  the  interest  of  national  security  or  public
health,  that  the  use  of  any  other  method  of  procurement  is  not
appropriate.

the  evaluation  of  a  submission  would  necessarily  be  particularly
detailed and the evaluation of a large number of submissions would
therefore require excessive time and resources from the entity.

86

(3)
Where a procuring entity desires to have suppliers pre-qualify, the entity
shall publish a notice, to be called a pre-qualification notice, inviting suppliers
to submit applications to pre-qualify.

(4)

The pre-qualification notice shall include

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

the principal terms and conditions of the procurement contract;

whether  a  pre-qualification  document  is  to  be  issued  or  whether
applications to pre-qualify should be submitted to the entity;

where no pre-qualification document is to be issued, the qualification
criteria and the procedures to be used for ascertaining the qualifications
of suppliers;

whether tenders are to be solicited from all pre-qualified suppliers or
only from a limited number of suppliers who best meet the qualification
criteria;

where  tenders  are  to  be  solicited  only  from  a  limited  number  of
suppliers, the maximum number of pre-qualified suppliers from whom
tenders are to be solicited and the manner in which that number is to
be selected; and

(f)

the procedure, place and deadline for submitting applications to pre-
qualify.

(5)

Where a pre-qualification document is to be issued, the entity shall

(a)

prepare the document in the form of the standard document, if any,
issued or approved by the Director for the purpose;

(b)

include in the document

(i)

(ii)

instructions  for  preparing  and  submitting  applications  to  pre-
qualify; and

a  clear  statement  of  the  qualification  criteria  and  of  any
documentary evidence or information required to be submitted to

87

demonstrate,  and  the  procedures  to  be  used  to  ascertain,  the
qualifications of suppliers; and

(c)

supply the document to any supplier who requests it.

(6)
Where a procuring entity engages in pre-qualification proceedings, only
suppliers that the entity has pre-qualified are entitled to participate further in the
procurement proceedings.

Clarification of pre-qualification notices and documents

Where a procuring entity receives, within a reasonable time prior to
93.(1)
the deadline for the submission of applications to pre-qualify, a request from a
supplier  for  clarification  of  a  pre-qualification  notice  or  a  pre-qualification
document, the entity shall

(a)

(b)

provide the clarification to the supplier; and

without identifying the source of the request, in the case of

(i)

a pre-qualification notice, publish the clarification; or

(ii)

a pre-qualification document, communicate the clarification to all
other suppliers to whom the entity provided the document.

A procuring entity shall provide a clarification referred to in subsection
(2)
(1), whether by publication or otherwise, to all suppliers at the same time and
within sufficient time to enable them to present their applications to pre-qualify
before the deadline for submission.

A procuring entity may, prior to the deadline for submitting applications
(3)
to pre-qualify, and, where required pursuant to section 7, with the approval of
the relevant tenders committee, whether on its own initiative or as a result of a
request for clarification by a supplier, modify a pre-qualification notice or a pre-
qualification document by issuing an addendum.

88

(4)

The addendum shall

(a)

in the case of

(i)

a pre-qualification notice, be published promptly; and

(ii)

a pre-qualification document, be communicated promptly to the
suppliers  to  whom  the  entity  provided  the  pre-qualification
document; and

(b)

be binding on the suppliers.

Where a procuring entity issues a clarification or modification of a pre-
(5)
qualification notice or a pre-qualification document, the entity shall, prior to the
deadline  for  presenting  applications  to  pre-qualify,  extend,  or  where  required
pursuant  to  section  7,  request  the  relevant  tenders  committee  to  extend  the
deadline where necessary in order to afford suppliers sufficient time to take the
clarification or modification into account in preparing their applications.

The procuring entity, or where required pursuant to section 7, the relevant
(6)
tenders  committee  may,  in  its  absolute  discretion,  prior  to  a  deadline  for
presenting applications to pre-qualify, extend the deadline where it is not possible
for one or more suppliers to present their applications by the deadline because of
any circumstance beyond their control.

(7)

Notice of an extension of a deadline shall

(a)

(b)

in the case of a pre-qualification notice, be published; and

in the case of a pre-qualification document, be given to all suppliers to
whom the entity provided the document.

The functions of a tenders committee under this section shall be discharged

(8)
by the chairman of the committee.

Evidence Act, Cap. 121 and it may take into account opinion evidence and such
facts as it considers relevant and material.

No information shall be disclosed in proceedings under sections 94 to

balance of advantage is in favour of preventing the disclosure of the
evidence in public, having regard both to the public interest and the

to do so would prejudice national security, impede law enforcement,
prejudice the legitimate, commercial interests of a supplier or impede
fair competition.
