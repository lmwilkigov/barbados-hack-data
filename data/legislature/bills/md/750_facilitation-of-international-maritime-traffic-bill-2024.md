3.1.1.
Recommended Practice. Contracting Governments should as far as possible agree,
by bilateral or multilateral agreements, to accept official documents of identity in lieu of passports.

3.2.
Standard. Public authorities shall make arrangements whereby passports, or official
documents of identity accepted in their place, from ship's passengers need be inspected by the
immigration authorities only once at the time of arrival and once at the time of departure. In
addition, these passports or official documents of identity may be required to be produced for the
purpose  of  verification  or  identification  in  connection  with  customs  and  other  formalities  on
arrival and departure.

3.3.
Standard.  After  individual  presentation  of  passports  or  official  documents  of
identity accepted in their place, public authorities shall hand back such documents immediately
after examination rather than withholding them for the purpose of obtaining additional control,
unless there is some obstacle to the admission of a passenger to the territory.

3.3.1.
Standard. Each Contracting Government shall ensure that the public authorities
seize  fraudulent,  falsified  or  counterfeit  travel  documents  of  inadmissible  persons.  Such
documents shall be removed from circulation and returned to the appropriate authorities when
practicable. In place of a seized document, a covering letter shall be issued by the removing State
and attached to it will be a photocopy of the forged travel documents, if available, as well as any
important information. The covering letter and its attachment shall be handed over to the operator
responsible for the removal of the inadmissible person. It will serve to give information to the
authorities at the transit and/or the original point of embarkation.

3.3.2.
Standard. Contracting Governments shall accept for examination a person being
returned from his/her point of disembarkation after having been found inadmissible if this person
had embarked in their territory. Contracting Governments shall not return such a person to the
country where he or she was earlier found to be inadmissible.

Standard.  Before  passengers  and  crew  are  accepted  for  examination  as  to  their
3.3.3.
admissibility  into  the  State,  responsibility  for  their  custody  and  care  shall  remain  with  the
shipowner.

Recommended Practice. After acceptance of passengers and crew for examination,
3.3.4.
whether conditional or unconditional and if the persons concerned are under the physical control

75

of the public authorities, the public authorities should be responsible for their custody and care
until they are admitted for entry or are found to be inadmissible.

3.3.5.
Standard. The obligation of a shipowner to transport any person away from the
territory of a State shall terminate from the moment such a person has been definitely admitted
into that State.

3.3.6.
Standard. Where a person is found to be inadmissible, the public authorities shall,
without  unreasonable  delay,  inform  the  shipowner  and  consult  the  shipowner  regarding  the
arrangements for removal. The shipowner is responsible for the costs of stay and removal of an
inadmissible person and, in the case where the person is transferred back to the custody of the
shipowner, the shipowner shall be responsible for effecting his/her prompt removal to:

the country of embarkation; or

to any other place where the person is admissible.

3.3.7.
practicable, to establish the validity and authenticity of passports and visas.

3.4.
Recommended Practice. Public authorities should not require from embarking or
disembarking  passengers,  or  from  shipowners  on  their  behalf,  any  information  in  writing
supplementary to or repeating that already presented in their passports or official documents of
identity, other than as necessary to complete any documents provided for in this annex.

3.5.
Recommended Practice. Public authorities which require written supplementary
information, other than as necessary to complete any documents provided for in this annex, from
embarking or disembarking passengers should limit requirements for further identification of
passengers  to  the  items  set  forth  in  Recommended  Practice  3.6  (embarkation/disembarkation
card). Public authorities should accept the embarkation/disembarkation card when completed by
the passenger and should not require that it be completed or checked by the shipowner. Legible
handwritten script should be accepted on the card, except where the form specifies block lettering.
One  copy  only  of  the  embarkation/disembarkation  card,  which  may  include  one  or  more
simultaneously prepared carbon copies, should be required from each passenger.

disembarking  from  ships  should  normally  be  limited  to  those  persons  arriving  from  an  area
infected with quarantinable diseases within the incubation period of the disease concerned (as
stated in the International Health Regulations). Additional medical examination may, however,
be required in accordance with the International Health Regulations.

3.9.
Recommended  Practice.  Public  authorities  should  normally  perform  customs
inspections  of  inbound  passengers'  accompanied  baggage  on  a  sampling  or  selective  basis.
Written declarations in respect of passengers' accompanied baggage should be dispensed with as
far as possible.

3.9.1.
Recommended  Practice.  Public  authorities  should,  wherever  possible,  waive
inspections of accompanied baggage of departing passengers, with due regard to the possible
need to impose appropriate security measures preferably by automated means to facilitate review.

3.9.2.
Recommended Practice. Where inspection of accompanied baggage of departing
passengers cannot be waived completely, such inspection should normally be performed on a
sampling or selective basis.

Standard. A passport or an identity document issued in accordance with relevant

presentation  of  individual  identity  documents  or  of  information  supplementing  the  seafarer's
identity document in respect of members of the crew other than that given in the Crew List.

B.

Measures to facilitate clearance of passengers, crew and baggage

Recommended  Practice.  Public  authorities  should,  with  the  cooperation  of
3.11.
shipowners and port authorities and/or port administration, take appropriate measures to the end
that satisfactory port traffic flow arrangements may be provided so that passengers, crew and
baggage  can  be  cleared  rapidly,  should  provide  adequate  personnel,  and  should  ensure  that
adequate installations are provided, particular attention being paid to baggage loading, unloading

78

and conveyance arrangements (including the use of mechanized systems) and to points where
passenger delays are frequently found to occur. Arrangements should be made, when necessary,
for passage under shelter between the ship and the point where the passenger and crew check is
to be made. Such arrangements and installations should be flexible and capable of expansion to
meet increased security measures during higher security levels.

3.11.1.

Recommended Practice. Public authorities should:

(a)

in cooperation with shipowners and port authorities, introduce suitable arrangements,
such as:

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

baggage;

a system which would permit passengers readily to identify and obtain
their checked baggage as soon as it is placed in an area where it may be
claimed; and

ensuring that facilities and services are available to meet the needs of
elderly and disabled passengers;

(b)

ensure that port authorities take all necessary measures so that:

(i)

(ii)

easy and speedy access for passengers and their baggage, to and from
local transport, is provided; and

if crews are required to report to premises for governmental purposes,
those premises should be readily accessible, and as close to one another
as practicable.

3.11.2.
Recommended Practice. Public authorities should consider, as a means of ensuring
prompt clearance, the introduction of the dual-channel system for the clearance of passengers,
and their baggage and private road vehicles.

3.12.
Standard.  Public  authorities  shall  require  that  shipowners  ensure  that  ship's
personnel  take  all  appropriate  measures  which  will  help  expedite  arrival  procedures  for
passengers and crew. These measures may include:

(a)

furnishing  public  authorities  concerned  with  an  advance  message  giving  the  best
estimated  time  of  arrival,  followed  by  information  as  to  any  change  in  time,  and
stating the itinerary of the voyage where this may affect inspection requirements;

having ship's documents ready for prompt review;

79

(c)

(d)

providing for ladders or other means of boarding to be rigged while the ship is en
route to berth or anchorage; and

providing for prompt, orderly assembling and presentation of persons on board, with
necessary  documents,  for  inspection,  with  attention  to  arrangements  for  relieving
crew members for this purpose from essential duties in engine-rooms and elsewhere.

3.13.
Recommended Practice. The practice of entering names on passenger and crew
documents should be to put the family name or names first. Where both paternal and maternal
family names are used, the paternal family name should be placed first. Where for married women
both the husband's and wife's paternal family names are used, the husband's paternal family name
should be placed first.

disproportionate fines upon shipowners, in the event that any control document in possession of
a passenger is found by public authorities to be inadequate, or if, for that reason, the passenger
is found to be inadmissible to the State.

3.15.1.
Standard. Public authorities shall encourage shipowners to take precautions at the
point of embarkation with a view to ensuring that passengers are in possession of any control
documents prescribed by the receiving or transit States.

3.15.2.
Standard.  When  a  person  is  found  to  be  inadmissible  and  is  removed  from  the
territory of the State, the shipowner shall not be precluded from recovering, from such a person,
any costs arising from his/her inadmissibility.

3.15.3.
Recommended Practice. For use at marine terminals and on board ships in order
to facilitate and expedite international maritime traffic, public authorities should implement or,
where the matter does not come within their jurisdiction, recommend responsible parties in their
country to implement standardized international signs and symbols developed or accepted by the
Organization in cooperation with other appropriate international organizations and which, to the
greatest extent practicable, are common to all modes of transport.

C.

Special facilities for marine transport of elderly and disabled passengers

picked up at a terminal building, reserved points should be located as close as possible to main
entrances. These should be clearly marked with appropriate signs. Access routes should be free
of obstacles.

3.18.
Recommended Practice. Where access to public services is limited, every effort
should be made to provide accessible and reasonably priced public transportation services by
adapting current and planned services or by providing special arrangements for passengers who
have impaired mobility.

clearance to allow the crew of ships which call regularly at their ports to obtain advance approval
for  temporary  shore  leave.  Where  a  ship  has  no  adverse  immigration  record  and  is  locally
represented by a shipowner or a reputable agent of the shipowner, the public authorities should
normally,  after  satisfactory  consideration  of  such  pre-arrival  particulars  as  they  may  require,
permit the ship to proceed directly to its berth and be subject to no further routine immigration
formalities, unless otherwise required by the public authorities.

Standard. Public authorities in the country of the ship's first scheduled port of call
after  discovery  of  a  stowaway  shall  allow  disembarkation  of  the  stowaway  when  the  public
authorities are satisfied that they or the shipowner will obtain valid travel documents, make timely
arrangements  for  repatriation  of  the  stowaway,  and  fulfil  all  the  requisites  for  transit.  Public
authorities shall, further, favourably consider allowing disembarkation of the stowaway, when it
is  impracticable  for  the  stowaway  to  remain  on  the  ship  or  other  factors  exist  which  would
preclude the stowaway remaining on the ship. Such factors may include, but are not limited to,
when:

a case is unresolved at the time of sailing of the ship; or

the presence on board of the stowaway would endanger the safe operation of the ship,
the health of the crew or the stowaway.

4.10.

Subsequent ports of call

4.9.1.
Standard. When disembarkation of a stowaway has failed in the first scheduled port
of call after discovery of the stowaway, public authorities of subsequent ports of call shall examine
the stowaway as for disembarkation in accordance with Standards 4.9.1, 4.9.2 and 4.9.3.

4.11.

State of Nationality or Right of Residence

4.11.1.
Standard. Public authorities shall in accordance with international law accept the
return of stowaways with full nationality/citizenship status or accept the return of stowaways who
in accordance with their national legislation have a right of residence in their State.

and nationality/citizenship of stowaways claiming to be a national or having a right of residence
in their State. Where possible, the local embassy, consulate or other diplomatic representation of
the country of the stowaway's nationality will be required to assist in verifying the stowaway's
nationality and providing emergency travel documentation.

4.12.

State of Embarkation

4.12.1.
Standard. When it has been established to their satisfaction that stowaways have
embarked  a  ship  in  a  port  in  their  State,  public  authorities  shall  accept  for  examination  such
stowaways  being  returned  from  their  point  of  disembarkation  after  having  been  found
inadmissible  there.  The  public  authorities  of  the  State  of  embarkation  shall  not  return  such
stowaways to the country where they were earlier found to be inadmissible.

88

4.12.2.
Standard.  When  it  has  been  established  to  their  satisfaction  that  attempted
stowaways  have  embarked  a  ship  in  a  port  in  their  State,  public  authorities  shall  accept
disembarkation of attempted stowaways, and of stowaways found on board the ship while it is
still in their territorial waters or if applicable according to the national legislation of that State in
the area of immigration jurisdiction of that State. No penalty or charge in respect of detention or

identifying the stowaway and determining his/her nationality;

making representations to the relevant public authority to assist in the removal of the
stowaway from the ship at the first available opportunity; and

making arrangements for the removal or repatriation of the stowaway.

4.14.

Return of stowaways

4.14.1.
Recommended  Practice.  When  a  stowaway  has  inadequate  documents,  public
authorities should, whenever practicable and to an extent compatible with national legislation
and security requirements, issue a covering letter with a photograph of the stowaway and any
other important information or, alternatively, a suitable travel document accepted by the public
authorities involved. The covering letter, authorizing the return of the stowaway either to his/her
country of origin or to the point where the stowaway commenced his/her journey, as appropriate,
by any means of transportation and specifying any other conditions imposed by the authorities,
should be handed over to the operator affecting the removal of the stowaway. This letter will
include information required by the authorities at transit points and/or the point of disembarkation.

4.14.2.
Recommended Practice. Public authorities in the State where the stowaway has
disembarked should contact the relevant public authorities at transit points during the return of a
stowaway, in order to inform them of the status of the stowaway. In addition public authorities
in countries of transit during the return of any stowaway should allow, subject to normal visa
requirements  and  national  security  concerns,  the  transit  through  their  ports  and  airports  of

89

stowaways travelling under the removal instructions or directions of public authorities of the
country of the port of disembarkation.

4.14.3.
Recommended  Practice.  When  a  port  State  has  refused  disembarkation  of  a
stowaway, that State should, without undue delay, notify the flag State of the ship carrying the
stowaway of the reasons for refusing disembarkation.

4.15.

Cost of return and maintenance of stowaways

4.15.1.
Recommended Practice. The public authorities of the State where a stowaway has
been disembarked should generally inform the shipowner on whose ship the stowaway was found,
as far as practicable, of the level of cost of detention and return and any additional costs for the
documentation  of  the  stowaway,  if  the  shipowner  is  to  cover  these  costs.  In  addition,  public
authorities  should  cooperate  with  the  shipowner  to  keep  such  costs  to  a  minimum  as  far  as
practicable and according to national legislation, if they are to be covered by the shipowner.

4.15.2.
Recommended Practice. The period during which shipowners are held liable to
defray costs of maintenance of a stowaway by public authorities in the State where the stowaway
has been disembarked should be kept to a minimum.

4.15.3.
Standard.  Public  authorities  shall,  according  to  national  legislation,  consider
mitigation  of  penalties  against  ships  where  the  master  of  the  ship  has  properly  declared  the
existence of a stowaway to the appropriate authorities in the port of arrival, and has shown that
all reasonable preventive measures had been taken to prevent stowaways gaining access to the
ship.

4.15.4.
Recommended  Practice.  Public  authorities  should,  according  to  national
legislation,  consider  mitigation  of  other  charges  that  might  otherwise  be  applicable,  when
shipowners have cooperated with the control authorities to the satisfaction of those authorities in
measures designed to prevent the transportation of stowaways.

also make arrangements whereby cargo ships and their loads can be entered and cleared, in so
far as may be practicable, at the ship working area.

5.2.
Recommended  Practice.  Public  authorities  should,  with  the  cooperation  of
shipowners, port authorities and port facilities and terminals, take appropriate measures to ensure
that  satisfactory  port  traffic  flow  arrangements  are  provided  so  that  handling  and  clearance
procedures for cargo will be smooth and uncomplicated. These arrangements should cover all
phases from the time the ship arrives at the dock for unloading and public authority clearance,
and also free zones, storage facilities, warehousing and onward movement of cargo if required.
There should be convenient and direct access between the free zone, storage facilities and cargo
warehouse and the public authority clearance area, which should be located close to the dock area
with, whenever possible, easy access and transfer capabilities and infrastructure.

5.3.
Recommended  Practice.  Public  authorities  should  encourage  owners  and/or
operators of marine cargo terminals to equip them with storage facilities for special cargo (e.g.
valuable goods, perishable shipments, human remains, radioactive and other dangerous goods,
as well as live animals), as appropriate; those areas of marine cargo terminals in which general
and special cargo and postal items are stored prior to shipment by sea or importation should
implement access control measures at least equivalent to those contained in the relevant text of
paragraph B/16 of the ISPS Code.

Standard. A Contracting Government which continues to require export, import
and transhipment licences or permits for certain types of goods shall establish simple procedures
whereby such licences or permits can be obtained and renewed rapidly.

Recommended  Practice.  When  the  nature  of  a  consignment  could  attract  the
5.5.
attention of different agencies authorized to carry out inspections, such as customs and veterinary
or sanitary controllers, Contracting Governments should authorize either customs or one of the
other agencies to carry out the required procedures or, where that is not feasible, take all necessary
steps  to  ensure  that  such  inspections  are  carried  out  simultaneously  at  one  place  and  with  a

91

minimum  of  delay  and  whenever  possible  carried  out  upon  prior  coordination  with  the  party
having custody of the consignment.

5.6.
Recommended Practice. Public authorities should provide simplified procedures
for the prompt clearance of private gift packages and trade samples not exceeding a certain value
or quantity which should be set at as high a level as possible.

5.15.
Standard. Public authorities shall, in conformity with their respective regulations,
permit the temporary admission of freight containers, pallets and freight container equipment and
accessories that are affixed to the container or are being transported separately without payment
of customs duties and other taxes and charges and shall facilitate their use in maritime traffic.

5.16.
Recommended  Practice.  Public  authorities  should  provide  in  their  regulations,
referred  to  in  Standard  5.15,  for  the  acceptance  of  a  simple  declaration  to  the  effect  that
temporarily imported freight containers, pallets and freight container equipment and accessories
will be re-exported within the time limit set by the State concerned. Such declaration may take
the form of an oral declaration or any other act acceptable to the authorities.

Standard.  Public  authorities  shall  permit  freight  containers,  pallets  and  freight
5.17.
container  equipment  and  accessories  entering  the  territory  of  a  State  under  the  provisions  of
Standard 5.15 to depart the limits of the port of arrival for clearance of imported cargo and/or
loading  of  export  cargo  under  simplified  control  procedures  and  with  a  minimum  of
documentation.

93

5.18.
Standard.  Contracting  Governments  shall  permit  the  temporary  admission  of
component parts of freight containers without payment of customs duties and other taxes and
charges when these parts are needed for the repair of freight containers already admitted under
the terms of Standard 5.15.

D.

Cargo not discharged at the port of intended destination

5.19.
Standard. Where any cargo listed on the Cargo Declaration is not discharged at the
port of intended destination, public authorities shall permit amendment of the Cargo Declaration
and shall not impose penalties if satisfied that the cargo was not in fact loaded on the ship, or, if
loaded, was landed at another port.

5.20.
Standard. When, by error or for another valid reason, any cargo is discharged at a
port other than the port of intended destination, public authorities shall facilitate reloading or
onward movement to its intended destination. This provision does not apply to prohibited or
restricted cargo.

E.

Limitation of shipowner's responsibilities

5.21.
Standard.  Public  authorities  shall  not  require  a  shipowner  to  place  special
information for use of such authorities on a transport document or a copy thereof, unless the
shipowner is, or is acting for, the importer or exporter.

5.22.
Standard.  Public  authorities  shall  not  hold  the  shipowner  responsible  for  the
presentation  or  accuracy  of  documents  which  are  required  of  the  importer  or  exporter  in
connection with the clearance of cargo, unless the shipowner is, or is acting for, the importer or
exporter.

5.23.
Standard. The shipowner shall be obliged to provide the information regarding the
entry or exit of goods known to the shipowner at the time of lodging such data and as set out in
the  transport  document  that  evidences  the  bill  of  lading.  Thus,  the  shipowner  can  base  the
lodgement on data provided by the shipper customer, unless the shipowner has reason to believe
that the data provided is untrue.

Recommended Practice. Public authorities should implement regulations pursuant
5.24.
to which the person who initiates and contractually agrees with a party (e.g. a consolidator, a
freight forwarder or a shipowner) for the carriage of a maritime cargo shipment to the territory
of another State must provide complete and accurate cargo shipment information to that party.

94

shipping.

6.2.
Recommended  Practice.  Contracting  Governments  having  certain  interests  in
common  owing  to  their  health,  geographical,  social  or  economic  conditions  should  conclude
special arrangements pursuant to article 85 of the International Health Regulations when such
arrangements will facilitate the application of those Regulations.

6.3.
Recommended  Practice.  Where  Sanitary  Certificates  or  similar  documents  are
required in respect of shipments of certain animals, plants or products thereof, such certificates
and documents should be simple and widely publicized and Contracting Governments should
cooperate with a view to standardizing such requirements.

6.4.
Recommended Practice. Public authorities should authorize granting of pratique

the health authority for the intended port of arrival is of the opinion that its arrival will not result
in  the  introduction  or  spread  of  a  quarantinable  disease.  Health  authorities  should  as  far  as
practicable be allowed to join a ship prior to entry of the ship into port.

6.4.1.
Standard.  Public  authorities  shall  seek  the  cooperation  of  shipowners  to  ensure
compliance with any requirement that illness on a ship is to be reported promptly by electronic
means  to  health  authorities  for  the  port  for  which  the  ship  is  destined,  in  order  to  facilitate
provision for the presence of any special medical personnel and equipment necessary for health
procedures on arrival.

6.5.
Standard. Public authorities shall make arrangements to enable all travel agencies
and others concerned to make available to passengers, sufficiently in advance of departure, lists
of  the  vaccinations  required  by  the  public  authorities  of  the  countries  concerned,  as  well  as
vaccination  certificate  forms  conforming  to  the  International  Health  Regulations.  Public
authorities shall take all possible measures to have vaccinators use the International Certificates
of Vaccination or Re-Vaccination in order to assure uniform acceptance.

Recommended  Practice.  Public  authorities  should  provide  facilities  for  the
6.6.
completion of International Certificates of Vaccination or Re-Vaccination as well as facilities for
vaccination at as many ports as feasible.

6.7.
Standard.  Public  authorities  shall  ensure  that  sanitary  measures  and  health
formalities are initiated forthwith, completed without delay, and applied without discrimination.

6.8.
Recommended  Practice.  To  ensure,  interalia,  efficient  maritime  traffic,  public
authorities should maintain at as many ports as feasible adequate facilities for the administration
of public health, animal and agricultural quarantine measures.

6.9.
Standard. There shall be maintained readily available at as many ports in a State
as  feasible  such  medical  facilities  as  may  be  reasonable  and  practicable  for  the  emergency
treatment of crews and passengers.

6.10.
Standard. Except in the case of an emergency constituting a grave danger to public
health, a ship which is not infected or suspected of being infected with a quarantinable disease
shall not, on account of any other epidemic disease, be prevented by the health authorities for a
port from discharging or loading cargo or stores or taking on fuel or water.

6.11.
Recommended Practice. Shipments of animals, animal raw materials, crude animal
products, animal foodstuffs and quarantinable plant products should be permitted in specified
circumstances and when the certification requirements have been met at the time of discharge.

Section 7- Miscellaneous provisions

A.

Bonds and other forms of security

7.1.
Recommended Practice. Where public authorities require bonds or other forms of
security  from  shipowners  to  cover  liabilities  under  the  customs,  immigration,  public  health,
agricultural quarantine or similar laws and regulations of a State, they should permit the use of
a single comprehensive bond or other form of security wherever possible.

B.

Services at ports

7.2.
Recommended Practice. The normal services of public authorities at a port should
be provided without charge during normal working hours. Public authorities should establish
normal working hours for their services at ports consistent with the usual periods of substantial
workload.

Standard.  Contracting  Governments  shall  adopt  all  practicable  measures  to
7.3.
organize the normal services of public authorities at ports in order to avoid unnecessary delay of
ships after their arrival or when ready to depart and reduce the time for completion of formalities

96

to a minimum, provided that sufficient notice of estimated time of arrival or departure shall be
given to the public authorities.

7.4.
Standard.  No  charge  shall  be  made  by  a  health  authority  for  any  medical
examination, or any supplementary examination, whether bacteriological or otherwise, carried
out at any time of the day or night, if such examination is required to ascertain the health of the
person  examined,  nor  for  visit  to  and  inspection  of  a  ship  for  quarantine  purposes  except
inspection of a ship for the issue of a Ship Sanitation Control Certificate or Ship Sanitation Control
Exemption Certificate, nor shall a charge be made for any vaccination of a person arriving by
ship nor for a certificate thereof. However, where measures other than these are necessary in
respect of a ship or its passengers or crew and charges are made for them by a health authority,
such charges shall be made in accordance with a single tariff which shall be uniform to the territory
concerned and they shall be levied without distinction as to the nationality, domicile or residence
of any person concerned or as to the nationality, flag, registry or ownership of the ship.

7.5.
Recommended  Practice.  When  the  services  of  public  authorities  are  provided
outside  the  regular  working  hours  referred  to  in  Recommended  Practice  7.2,  they  should  be
provided on terms which shall be moderate and not exceed the actual cost of the services rendered.

7.6.
Standard. Where the volume of traffic at a port warrants, public authorities shall
ensure that services are provided for the accomplishment of the formalities in respect of cargo
and baggage, regardless of value or type.

7.7.
Recommended  Practice.  Contracting  Governments  should  endeavour  to  make
arrangements whereby one Government will permit another Government certain facilities before
or during the voyage to examine ships, passengers, crew, baggage, cargo and documentation for
customs, immigration, public health, plant and animal quarantine purposes when such action will
facilitate clearance upon arrival in the latter State.

facilitation programme based on the facilitation requirements of this annex and ensure that the
objective of its facilitation programme should be to adopt all practical measures to facilitate the
movement of ships, cargo, crews, passengers, mail and stores, by removing unnecessary obstacles
and delays.

7.12.
Recommended Practice. Each Contracting Government should establish a national
maritime  transport  facilitation  Committee  or  a  similar  national  coordinating  body,  for  the
encouragement  of  the  adoption  and  implementation  of  facilitation  measures,  between
governmental departments, agencies and other organizations concerned with, or responsible for,
various aspects of international maritime traffic, as well as port authorities, port facilities and
terminals and shipowners.

 L.R.O. 1998REVISED GUIDELINES ON THE PREVENTION OF ACCESS BY STOWAWAYS AND THE ALLOCATION OF RESPONSIBILITIES TO SEEK THE SUCCESSFUL RESOLUTION OF STOWAWAY CASES1 Introduction1.1 Masters, shipowners, public authorities, port authorities and other stakeholders,including those providing security services ashore, have a responsibility to cooperate to the fullest extent possible in order:.1 to prevent stowaway incidents; and.2 to resolve stowaway cases expeditiously and secure that an early return or repatriation of the stowaway will take place; all appropriate measures should be taken in order to avoid situations where stowaways must stay on board ships for an unreasonable amount of time.1.2 However, no matter how eﬀ ective port and ship security measures are, it is recognized that there will still be occasions when stowaways gain access to vessels, either secreted in the cargo or by surreptitious boarding.1.3 The resolution of stowaway cases is diﬃ  cult because of diﬀ erent national legislation in each of the several potentially involved States: the State of embarkation, the State of disembarkation, the ﬂ ag State of the ship, the State of apparent, claimed or actual nationality/ citizenship or right of residence of the stowaway, and States of transit during repatriation.2 Deﬁ nitionsFor the purpose of these Guidelines, the following meanings shall be attributed to the terms listed:.1 Attempted stowaway. A person who is secreted on a ship, or in cargo which is subsequently loaded on the ship, without the consent of the shipowner or the master or any other responsible person, and who is detected on board the ship before it has departed from the port..2 Port. Any port, terminal, oﬀ shore terminal, ship and repair yard or roadstead which is normally used for the loading, unloading, repair and anchoring of ships, or any other place at which a ship can call.Fourth Schedule - (Cont'd)160

 L.R.O. 1998.3 Public authorities. The agencies or oﬃ  cials in a State responsible for the application and enforcement of the laws and regulations of that State which relate to any aspect of the present Guidelines..4 Security measures. Measures developed and implemented in accordance with international agreements to improve security on board ships and in port areas and facilities, and of goods moving in the international supply chain, to detect and prevent unlawful acts.1.5 Shipowner. One who owns or operates a ship, whether a person, a corporation or other legal entity, and any person acting on behalf of the owner or operator..6 Stowaway. A person who is secreted on a ship, or in cargo which is subsequently loaded on the ship, without the consent of the shipowner or the master or any other responsible person and who is detected on board the ship after it has departed from a port, or in the cargo while unloading it in the port of arrival, and is reported as a stowaway by the master to the appropriate authorities.3 Basic principlesOn the basis of the experience thus far, the application of the following basic principles have been useful in preventing stowaway incidents and have been helpful in the speedy resolution of stowaway cases:.1 Stowaway incidents should be dealt with in a manner consistent with humanitarian principles. Due consideration must always be given to the operational safety of the ship and to the safety and well-being of the stowaway..2 Public authorities, port authorities, shipowners and masters should cooperate to the fullest extent possible in order to prevent stowaway incidents._________1 Reference is made to chapter XI-2 of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, as amended (1974 SOLAS Convention) and the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code, as amended (ISPS Code); and to the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation, 1988 (1988 SUA Convention) and its 2005 Protocol (2005 SUA Protocol).Fourth Schedule - (Cont'd)161

 L.R.O. 1998.3 Shipowners, masters, port authorities and public authorities should have adequate security arrangements in place which, as far as practicable, will prevent intending stowaways from getting aboard a ship or, if this fails, will detect them before the ship leaves port or, at the latest, before it arrives at the next port of call..4 Adequate, frequent and well-timed searches minimize the risk of having to deal with a stowaway case and may also save the life of a stowaway who may, for example, be hiding in a place which is subsequently sealed and/or chemically treated..5 Public authorities, port authorities, shipowners and masters should cooperate to the fullest extent possible in order to resolve stowaway cases expeditiously and secure that an early return or repatriation of the stowaway will take place. All appropriate measures should be taken in order to avoid situations where stowaways must stay on board ships for an unreasonable amount of time..6 Stowaways arriving at or entering a State without the required documents are, in general, illegal entrants. Decisions on dealing with such situations are the prerogative of the States where such arrival or entry occurs..7 Stowaway asylum seekers should be treated in accordance with international protection principles as set out in international instruments, such as the provisions of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees of 28 July 1951 and of the United Nations Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees of 31 January 1967 and relevant national legislation.2.8 Every eﬀ ort should be made to avoid situations where a stowaway has to be  detained on board a ship indeﬁ nitely. In this regard States should cooperate with the shipowner in arranging the disembarkation of a stowaway to an appropriate State..9 States should accept the return of stowaways who have full nationality/ citizenship status in that State, or have a right of residence in that State..10 Where the nationality or citizenship or right of residence cannot be established, the State of the original port of embarkation of a stowaway should accept the return of such a stowaway for examination pending ﬁ nal case disposition._________2 In addition, public authorities may wish to consider the non-binding conclusion of the UNHCR Executive Committee on Stowaway Asylum Seekers (1988, No. 53 (XXXIX)).Fourth Schedule - (Cont'd)162

 L.R.O. 19984 Preventive measures4.1 Port/terminal authorities4.1.1 States and port and terminal owners, operators and authorities should ensure that the necessary infrastructure, and operational and security arrangements for the purpose of preventing persons attempting to stowaway on board ships from gaining access to portinstallations and to ships, are established in all their ports, taking into consideration when developing these arrangements the size of the port, and what type of cargo is shipped from the port. This should be done in close cooperation with relevant public authorities, shipowners and shore-side entities, with the aim of preventing stowaway occurrences in the individual port.4.1.2 Operational arrangements and/or port facility security plans should at least be equivalent to those contained in the relevant text of section B/16 of the ISPS Code.34.2 Shipowner/Master4.2.1 Shipowners and masters should ensure that adequate security arrangements are in place which, as far as practicable, will prevent intending stowaways from getting aboard the ship, and, if this fails, as far as practicable, will detect them before the ship  leaves  port or,  at the latest, before it arrives at the next port of call.4.2.2 When calling at ports and during stay in ports, where there is risk of stowaway embarkation, operational arrangements and/or ship security plans should at least be equivalent to those contained in the relevant text of paragraph B/9 of the ISPS Code.44.2.3 When departing from a port, where there is risk of stowaway embarkation, a ship should undergo a thorough search in accordance with a speciﬁ c plan or schedule, and with priorities given to places where stowaways might hide taking into account the speciﬁ c ship type and its operations. Search methods which are likely to harm secreted stowaways should not be used.4.2.4 Fumigation or sealing should not be carried out until a thorough search of the areas to be fumigated or sealed has taken place in order to ensure that no stowaways are present in those areas._________3 Recommended Practice 4.3.1.2 of the FAL Convention.4 Recommended Practice 4.3.2.2 of the FAL Convention.Fourth Schedule - (Cont'd)163
