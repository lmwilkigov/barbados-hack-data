(a)

(b)

(c)

Where in the opinion of the Commission a building to which this Act

is unfit for human habitation;

creates a nuisance; or

(d)

is injurious or likely to be injurious to health,

18

the Commission may serve on the owner or occupier thereof notice in writing
requiring him to demolish, secure, repair or rebuild the building to the satisfaction
of the Commission within the time specified in the notice.

Where the owner fails to comply with the requirements of a notice served
(2)
pursuant to subsection (1) within the time specified therein, the Commission or
any person authorised in writing by the Chairman of the Commission may execute
the works mentioned therein and may, if the Commission deems it expedient,
order the whole or any portion of the expenses thereby incurred to be defrayed
out of funds at its disposal for such purpose.

Any expenses incurred by the Commission for the purposes of this section
(3)
are a debt due to the Commission and, without prejudice to any other remedy,
may be recovered summarily as a debt due to the Commission in civil proceedings
notwithstanding  that  the  expenses  exceed  the  normal  monetary  limit  on  the
jurisdiction of a magistrate’s court.

Where personal service of a notice referred to in subsection (1) cannot be
(4)
effected,  whether  by  reason  of  the  absence  of  the  owner  or  occupier  from

sanitary defects.

(7)
Commission pursuant to subsection (2) the Commission shall satisfy itself that
suitable alternative accommodation is available for the affected persons.

19

Appeals

23.(1)
A person served with a notice under section 22(1) or any other person
having an estate or interest in the building to which the notice relates, may, at
any time before the expiration of the period specified in the notice pursuant to
section 22(2) and in accordance with any rules of court, appeal to a Judge in
Chambers against the notice on any of the following grounds:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

(f)

(g)

that the notice or requirement is not justified for the protection of or in
the interest of public health;

that there is some informality, defect or error in or in connection with
the notice;

that the Minister has refused unreasonably to approve the execution of
alternative works;

that works required by the notice to be executed are unreasonable in
character or extent or are unnecessary;

that the time within which the works are required by the notice to be
executed is not sufficient for the purpose;

that the notice might lawfully have been served on the occupier of the
premises  to  which  it  related  instead  of  the  owner,  or  on  the  owner
instead of the occupier, and it would have been equitable for it to have
been so served;

where  the  work  is  work  for  the  common  benefit  of  the  premises  to
which the notice relates and other premises, that some other person,
being the owner or occupier of the other premises to be benefited, ought
to contribute towards the expenses of executing any works required.

Where an appeal under subsection (1) is based on the ground specified in
(2)
paragraph (b) thereof, the Judge shall dismiss the appeal if he is satisfied that the
informality, defect or error was not material.

20

(3)
Where the grounds upon which an appeal is brought under subsection (1)
include the grounds specified in paragraph (f) or (g), the appellant shall serve a
copy of his notice of appeal

(a)

(b)

on every person referred to in paragraph (f) or (g), as the case may be;
and

on any other person having an estate or interest in the building to which
the notice referred to in section 22(1) relates.

Upon the hearing of the appeal referred to in subsection (3) the Judge may

(4)
make such order as he thinks fit

(a)

in respect of

(i)

the person by whom any work is required to be executed; and

(ii)

the contribution to be made by any other person towards the cost
of the work; or

(b)

with  respect  to  the  proportions  in  which  any  expenses  which  may
become  recoverable  by  the  Minister  under  subsection  (9)  are  to  be
borne by the appellant and such other person.

In  exercising  his  powers  under  subsection  (4)  the  Judge  shall  have

(5)
regard,

(a)

as  between  an  owner  and  an  occupier,  to  the  terms  and  conditions,
whether contractual or statutory of the tenancy and to the nature of the
works required; and

(b)

in  any  case,  to  the  degree  of  benefit  to  be  derived  by  the  different
persons concerned.

Upon the determination of an appeal made under subsection (1), the Judge
(6)
shall  give  directions  for  giving  effect  to  his  decision,  including,  where
appropriate, directions for quashing the notice which is the subject of the appeal
or for varying the terms of such notice in favour of the appellant.

21

(7)
Where the notice referred to in subsection (6) is varied or the appeal is
dismissed, the Judge may, if he thinks fit, order that the notice be suspended until
such date (not being later than 28 days from the determination of the appeal) as
he thinks fit.

(8)

The decision of the Judge is final.

Where at the expiration of the period specified in a notice under section
(9)
22(1) or on the expiration of the period ordered by a Judge on the determination
of an appeal brought under subsection (1) the work specified in the notice or in
the notice as varied by the Judge under subsection (6) has not been executed, the
Minister may cause such work to be executed, and on completion thereof may
recover  the  costs  of  executing  the  works  as  a  debt  due  to  the  State  in  civil
proceedings notwithstanding that the amount of such costs exceeds the normal
monetary limit on the jurisdiction of a magistrate’s court.

In any proceedings under subsection (9), the validity of the notice to which
(10)
the  proceedings  relate  shall  not  be  questioned  on  any  ground  specified  in
subsection (1).

Redevelopment plans

24.(1)
Where the Commission is satisfied that the housing conditions in an
area are dangerous, injurious or likely to be injurious to the health and welfare
of the inhabitants by reason of

(a)

(b)

(c)

the disrepair or sanitary defects of the dwelling houses in the area;

the bad arrangement of the houses in the area; or

the narrowness or bad arrangement of the roads,

and  that  those  conditions  can  be  remedied  by  ordering  the  demolition,
reconstruction  or  repair  of  those  dwelling  houses  that  are  unfit  for  human
habitation, the Commission shall cause that area to be defined on a plan in such
a manner as to exclude from that area any land or buildings in respect of which,
in its opinion, sanitary defects do not exist.

22

(2)
The Commission shall pass a resolution declaring the area defined under
subsection (1) to be a re-development area and shall, within the period specified
in section 26, prepare and submit to the Minister a scheme, hereinafter referred
to as a “re-development scheme”, for the exercise of its powers under this Act.

Redevelopment schemes

As soon as may be practicable after the Commission has passed the
25.(1)
resolution mentioned in section 24(2), the Commission shall send a copy of the
resolution to the Minister and shall publish

(a)

(b)

in the Official Gazette; and

by  advertisement,  a  minimum  of  3  times,  in  a  newspaper  that  is
circulated, printed and published in Barbados,

a notice stating that the resolution has been passed and naming a place where a
copy of the resolution may be inspected.

Within 3 months after the Commission passes the resolution referred to in
(2)
subsection (1) or such further period as the Minister may allow, the Commission
shall  prepare  and  submit  to  the  Minister  a  scheme  to  be  known  as  a  “re-
development  scheme”  accompanied  by  a  statement  containing  appropriate
particulars of the scheme indicating

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

the manner in which it is intended that the area shall be laid out and the
land therein used, and in particular the land intended to be used for the
provision  of  houses,  roads  and  open  spaces,  community  facilities,
schools, churches, play centres and recreation grounds;

the approximate number and the nature of the houses to be provided
by the Commission;

the average number of houses to be constructed per acre;

if the demolition of existing houses and the erection of new houses are
proposed, the nature of the proposed new houses;

23

(e)

(f)

(g)

(h)

if the total demolition of existing houses is not proposed, the nature of
repairs, improvements and reconstruction intended to be made;

the time within which the scheme or any part thereof is to be completed;

the estimated cost of the scheme and of the rents expected to be derived
from the houses provided under the scheme;

incidental,  consequential  and  supplementary  provisions
such
(including provisions as to the subsequent variation of the scheme) as
may appear necessary or proper for the purposes of the scheme;

(i)

objections  made  by  persons  affected  by  the  scheme  where  such
objections have not been withdrawn or met.

(3)

The Commission shall, before submitting such scheme to the Minister,

(a)

(b)

publish by advertisement, a minimum of 3 times, in a newspaper that
is circulated, printed and published in Barbados, a notice stating that
the  scheme  is  about  to  be  submitted  to  the  Minister  for  approval,
naming a place where particulars of the scheme may be inspected and
specifying the time within which and the manner in which objections
may be made; and

serve  a  notice  to  the  like  effect  on  every  owner  and  on  every  other
person who to the knowledge of the Commission has any interest in
land in the area affected by the scheme, except persons holding under
a monthly tenancy or tenancy for a lesser period.

Where a person is aggrieved by a notice served pursuant to subsection (3)
(4)
he shall appeal to a Judge in Chambers within 14 days of receipt of such notice.

Notification of approval of scheme

26.(1)
of any re-development scheme, the Commission shall forthwith publish

Upon notification to the Commission of the approval of the Minister

(a)

in the Official Gazette; and

24

(b)

by  advertisement,  a  minimum  of  3  times,  in  a  newspaper  that  is
circulated, printed and published in Barbados,

a notice stating that the scheme has been approved and naming a place where a
copy of the scheme and particulars thereof may be inspected.

Where, after a scheme has been approved, it appears to the Commission
(2)
that  any  land  in  the  area  comprised  in  the  approved  scheme  ought  to  be  re-
developed or used otherwise than as indicated in the scheme, the Commission
shall prepare and submit for the approval of the Minister a new scheme in respect
of that land.

In the following provisions of this Act, references to “re-development” or
(3)
“use in accordance with a scheme” shall be construed as references to a scheme
approved under this section or, in the case of land comprised in a new scheme
approved under this section, in accordance with the new scheme.

Demolition order

Where, with respect to any area included in a re-development scheme
27.(1)
approved by the Minister, the Commission determines that any building in the
area ought to be demolished, it shall make and serve on the owner of the building
an order referred to in this Act as a “demolition order” for the demolition of the
building.

Subject to this section, subsections (2), (3), (6) of section 22 apply to an
(2)
order referred to in subsection (1) as if it were a notice served under subsection
(1) of section 22.

Where the Commission, pursuant to an order made under subsection (1),
(3)
demolishes any building, the Commission may sell or otherwise dispose of any
materials resulting from the demolition of the building.

Any amount realised by the sale of materials referred to in subsection (3)
(4)
may be deducted from the expenses recoverable under subsection (3) of section
23.

25

(5)
Where the amount referred to in subsection (4) is greater than the expenses
recoverable under subsection (3) of section 22, the Commission shall pay the
surplus to the owner of the land or building, as the case may be.

Use of land

When a demolition order is to be carried out, no land to which the
28.(1)
order applies shall be used for building purposes or otherwise developed except
subject to such restrictions and conditions as the Commission may think fit to
impose.

Any owner who is aggrieved by a restriction or condition referred to in
(2)
subsection (1), or by a refusal of the Commission to cancel or modify any such
restriction or condition, may, within 28 days, appeal to a Judge in Chambers, who
may make such order as he thinks proper and the decision of the Judge shall be
final.

Acquisition of land

29.
Any land or building within a re-development area or any interest in
any  such  land  or  building  that  is  to  be  acquired  by  the  Commission  for  the
purposes of this Act may be compulsorily acquired in accordance with the Land
Acquisition Act, Cap. 228 at any time after the expiration of 28 days from the
first publication of the notice required by subsection (1) of section 27.

Assessment and compensation

30.(1)
Where  any  land  or  building  or  any  interest  therein  is  compulsorily
acquired  under  the  Land  Acquisition  Act,  Cap.  228,  compensation  shall  be

26

assessed and shall be paid to the owner of such land or building or interest therein,
subject to this Act, in accordance with the Land Acquisition Act.

The  Commission  shall  forthwith  out  of  its  own  funds  pay  into  the
(2)
Consolidated Fund any compensation payable pursuant to the Land Acquisition
Act in respect of any compulsory acquisition.

In  assessing  the  amount  of  compensation  payable  under  the  Land
(3)
Acquisition Act to the owner of any land or building or to any person with any
interest  therein  for  the  purposes  of  this  Act,  regard  shall  be  had  to  the
following:

(a)

(b)

in  the  case  of  land  with  buildings  thereon  that  are  unfit  for  human
habitation or are dangerous, or injurious or likely to be injurious to the
health of the inhabitants of the area, the compensation payable shall be
the site value of the land as unimproved land, without regard to any
buildings existing thereon;

in the case of land with buildings thereon in respect of which sanitary
defects exist but which are not otherwise unfit for human habitation or
dangerous, or injurious or likely to be injurious to the health of the
inhabitants of the area, the compensation payable shall be the site value
of the land as improved land minus the amount required to rectify the
sanitary defects; and

(c)

in the case of any other land and building other than land and building
referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b), the compensation payable shall
be the improved value thereof.

In the case of any dwelling house or other building which is regarded as
(4)
dangerous or injurious or likely to be injurious to health under paragraph (a) or
(b) of subsection (3) only by reason of its bad arrangement in relation to other
buildings  or  the  narrowness  or  the  bad  arrangement  of  the  roads,  the
compensation payable shall be as in paragraph (c) of subsection (3).

Where a building is used partly for the purposes of a dwelling house and
(5)
partly for other purposes, no compensation shall be payable where the part of the

27

building used for purposes other than as a dwelling house is, by reason of disrepair
or sanitary defects, regarded as unfit for human habitation.

In determining for the purposes of this Act whether a house is fit for human
(6)
habitation, regard shall be had to the extent to which by reason of disrepair or
sanitary defects the house falls short of the provisions of the Health Services
(Building) Regulations, 1969 (S.I. 1969 No. 233).

The owner of any building that is regarded as unfit for human habitation,
(7)
on making a request to the Commission in writing, is entitled to be furnished by
the Commission with a statement in writing of its reasons for deciding that the
building is so unfit.

Payment in respect of well-maintained houses

Where  a  property,  or  part  thereof,  is  well-maintained  and  does  not
31.(1)
have any sanitary or other defects, but is to be acquired for a public purpose, the
value of the property shall be paid in full by the State.

(2)

A payment under this section shall be of an amount equal either

(a)

(b)

to  the  amount  by  which  the  aggregate  expenditure  shown  to  the
satisfaction of the Commission to have been incurred in maintaining
the house during the 5 years immediately before the date on which the
order was made exceeds an amount equal to one and one-quarter times
the actual rent received during that period for the house or, where no
rent was received, the rent that might have been received had the house
been let; or

to one and one-half times or, if at that date the house is occupied by an
owner thereof and has been owned and occupied by him or a member
of his family continuously during the 3 years immediately before that
date, 3 times the rent that might have been received, during that period,
had the house been let,

whichever is the greater.

28

A payment under this section shall not in any case exceed the difference

(3)
between

(a)

the full value of the house (that is to say, the amount which would have
been  payable  as  compensation  by  virtue  of  its  being  compulsorily
acquired as being fit for human habitation); and

(b)

the amount which is payable as compensation under this Act by virtue
of its being compulsorily acquired as unfit for human habitation.

Any question as to the value of a house referred to in subsection (3) shall
(4)
be determined, in default of agreement, as if it had been a question of disputed
compensation arising on such acquisition.

(5)

A payment under this section shall be made,

(a)

(b)

if the house is occupied by the owner thereof, to such owner; or

if the house is not so occupied, to the person liable under any covenant
or agreement or otherwise to maintain and repair the house, and if more
than one person is so liable, in such shares as the Commission thinks
equitable in the circumstances.

Commission to make allowances

32.
Where  the  Commission  has  purchased  a  dwelling  house  or  other
building located within a re-development area because that dwelling house or
other  building  is  unfit  for  human  habitation  and  is  not  capable  at  reasonable
expense of being rendered fit, the Commission may pay

(a)

(b)

to any person displaced from the dwelling house or such other building
such reasonable allowance as the Commission may think fit towards
his expense of moving; or

to any person carrying on a trade or business in any such dwelling house
or other building such reasonable allowance toward the loss which, in
its opinion, he would sustain by reason of the disturbance of his trade
or  business  consequent  on  his  having  to  quit  the  dwelling  house  or

29

building; and in assessing that loss the Commission shall have regard
to the period for which the premises occupied by him might reasonably
have  been  expected  to  be  available  for  the  purpose  of  his  trade  or
business and the availability of other premises suitable for the purpose.

Costs of persons opposing scheme

The Minister may make such provision as he thinks fit in favour of
33.(1)
any owner of any land or house included in a re-development scheme approved
by  him  for  the  allowance  of  reasonable  expenses  incurred  by  the  owner  in
opposing the scheme.

Expenses allowed under subsection (1) shall be deemed to be expenses
(2)
incurred by the Commission under this Act and shall be paid to that person in
such manner and at such times and either in a lump sum or by instalments as the
Minister may determine.
