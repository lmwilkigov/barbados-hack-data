ADDENDUM
On the 9® day of April, 2009, the Cabinet agreed to the acquisition of lands situate at Sturges in the parish of Saint Thomas to facilitate the Harrison’s Cave Re-development Project.
On the 17 day of June, 2010, Cabinet rescinded the decision of April 9, 2009 pertaining to the acquisition and instead agreed to the acquisition of lands at Sturges, Saint Thomas for an expanded public purpose; namely, to facilitate the Harrison’s Cave Re-development Project and for public access.
In accordance with section 3 of the Land Acquisition Act, Cap. 228, a notice was published in the Official Gazette on the 30" day of August 2010 and on the 2 and 6" days of September respectively; however, reference was only made to the Harrison’s Cave Re-development Project and the words “and for public access”, were erroneously omitted.
A notice containing the correction was re-published in the Official Gazette on the 7, 11" and 14" of April, 2011 respectively, replacing the notice published on the said 30" of August, 2010 and on the 2™ and 6" days of September, 2010.
In accordance with section 5 of the Land Acquisition Act, Cap. 228, the approval of Parliament is now sought for the compulsory acquisition of the parcels of land, described in the Schedules hereto, in order that the public purposes set out in this Resolution may be effected and that the Crown may acquire an indefeasible title to the said parcels of land.
