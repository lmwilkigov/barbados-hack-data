prepared a physical development plan for Barbados as a whole for approval by
Parliament in accordance with the provisions of this Part.

(2)
Where an approved physical development plan for Barbados as a whole is
in force, it is the duty of the Chief Town Planner to review and revise it, or cause
it to be reviewed and revised, in accordance with the provisions of this Part.

Physical development plans for parts of Barbados

13.(1)
At  any  time  after  the  physical  development  plan  for  the  whole  of
Barbados has been approved, the Chief Town Planner may prepare or cause to
be prepared a draft physical development plan for any specified part of Barbados,
or  adopt,  with  or  without  variations,  such  a  plan  proposed  by  a  community
situated in the area or any person or organisation who has an interest in the area.

A  draft  physical  development  plan  prepared  for  a  specified  part  of
(2)
Barbados  shall  conform  to  the  prescriptions  of  the  approved  physical
development plan Barbados as a whole, as revised from time to time.

28

Contents of physical development plans

14.(1)
shall

(a)

(b)

A  physical  development  plan  prepared  for  approval  under  this  Act

set  out  prescriptions  for  the  use  and  development  of  land  which
represent the results of an integrated planning process; and

include  such  maps  and  descriptive  matter  as  may  be  necessary  to
illustrate  the  proposals  made  in  it  with  such  degree  of  detail  as  is
appropriate to Barbados as a whole or the specified part of Barbados
to which the plan relates.

(2)

A physical development plan may

(a)

allocate land for use for residential, industrial, commercial, tourism,

Chief Town Planner shall consult with any governmental or non-governmental
organisations,  including  the  private  sector,  with  an  interest  in  the  matters  for
which proposals may be made in the plan or policy document.

Without  prejudice  to  the  generality  of  subsection  (1),  in  the  course  of
(2)
preparation of a draft physical development plan, the Chief Town Planner shall
have  regard  to  the  policies,  strategies  and  standards  for  the  management  and
conservation  of  coastal  resources  in  a  Coastal  Zone  Management  Area,
established under the Coastal Zone Management Act, Cap. 394, made under a
Coastal Zone Management Plan approved in accordance with that Act.

29

(3)
Chief Town Planner shall take reasonable steps to ensure that

(a)

(b)

adequate publicity is given to the matters concerning which proposals
will be made in the plan in the area to which it relates; and

persons who may wish to make representations with respect to those
matters  are  invited  and  given  an  adequate  opportunity  to  make
representations concerning those matters.

Approval of physical development plan

When a draft physical development plan has been prepared, copies
16.(1)
shall be made available for public inspection at the offices of the Department and
such other places as the Chief Town Planner considers appropriate for bringing
it to the attention of persons who are likely to be affected, directly or indirectly,
by the proposals in the plan, and an electronic copy of the draft plan shall be
published on the internet.

The Chief Town Planner shall give notice in the Official Gazette and at
(2)
least one newspaper in daily circulation in Barbados of the places where and
times when the draft physical development plan may be inspected and shall give
such other publicity to the matter as is appropriate to inform the public in general,

physical development plan, by or before the date specified in the notice.

The  Chief  Town  Planner  shall  receive  written  comments  on  the  draft
(3)
physical development plan for not less than 28 days from the date of publication
of the notice in the Official Gazette.

After  the  expiry  of  the  period  specified  in  the  notice  published  in
(4)
accordance with subsection (3) for the making of written comments on a draft
physical development plan, the Chief Town Planner shall consider any comments
made by the public and forward a report on them, together with the Chief Town
Planner’s own observations, to the Minister as soon as practicable.

30

(5)
Where the Minister determines that there is sufficient public interest in the
draft physical development plan, the Minister may appoint a person to hold a
public hearing to discuss the draft physical development plan and receive verbal
comments with regard to the proposals therein, before accepting the draft plan,
with or without modifications, or rejecting the plan.

(6)

After considering

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

the draft physical development plan;

the report of the Chief Town Planner on the public comments;

the observations of the Chief Town Planner on the public comments;

the report from the person who held the public hearing as referred to
in subsection (5)

the Minister may accept the draft plan, with or without modifications, or reject
the plan.

Where the Minister accepts the draft physical development plan, within
(7)
one  year  from  the  date  on  which  notice  is  published  in  the  Official  Gazette
pursuant to subsection (3), the Minister shall lay the draft plan for approval by
both Houses of Parliament.

The  draft  plan  is  subject  to  affirmative  resolution  of  both  Houses  of

(8)
Parliament.

When  a  physical  development  plan  is  approved  by  both  Houses  of
(9)
Parliament,  the  Minister  shall  publish  a  notice  of  the  approval  in  the  Official
Gazette and the plan comes into operation from the date of publication, or such
later date as may be prescribed in the notice.

The Chief Town Planner shall make documentary copies of an approved
(10)
physical development plan available for sale to the public at a reasonable price
and shall make an electronic copy of the approved plan available via the internet.

31

Review and revision of physical development plans

17.(1)
The Minister may at any time require the Chief Town Planner to carry
out a review of an approved plan and submit a report on that review together with
proposals  for  any  alterations  or  additions  to  the  plan  which  appear  to  be
appropriate.

Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), at least once in every
(2)
10 years after the date on which a physical development plan for the whole of
Barbados comes into operation, the Chief Town Planner shall carry out a review
and report on the plan as stated in subsection (1).

The provisions of this Part with respect to the preparation and approval of
(3)
a  physical  development  plan  apply  mutatis  mutandis  to  the  preparation  and
approval of any modification to or revision of a physical development plan.

Status of physical development plan

18.(1)
development plan has been approved by Parliament

Where a physical development plan or an amendment to a physical

(a)

(b)

(c)

every public officer shall have due regard to, and so far as is practicable,
be guided by the plan in formulating and preparing any public sector
investment project;

the Board shall give principal consideration to and be guided by the
plan in considering any application for a planning permission; and

any person exercising a power to grant any fiscal incentive or other
form  of  public  sector  assistance  for  the  carrying  out  of  any  private
sector  investment  project  shall  ensure  that  the  proposed  project  is
consistent  with  the  plan  and  has  been  granted  planning  permission
under this Act, if required.

32

(2)
Where two or more physical development plans have been approved which
apply in whole or in part to the same area and there is any conflict or discrepancy
between them, then

(a)

(b)

the plan drawn to the larger scale has precedence;

the later plan is deemed to have modified the earlier plan, regardless
of  the  relative  scales  of  the  two  plans,  unless  there  is  an  express
provision to the contrary.

An  approved  physical  development  plan  remains  in  effect  until  it  is
(3)
rescinded by affirmative resolution of both Houses of Parliament and a notice to
that effect is published in the Official Gazette.

Planning Policy Documents

At  any  time  after  the  national  physical  development  plan  has  been
19.(1)
approved,  the  Chief  Town  Planner  may  prepare  or  cause  to  be  prepared
supplementary  planning  policies  providing  detailed  guidance  for
the
implementation  of  physical  development  plans  and  the  regulation  of  land
development in Barbados.

Any draft planning policy document shall be published for public comment

(2)
for a period of no less than 28 days before its approval by the Minister.

After considering the draft planning policy document and any comments
(3)
received from members of the public with respect thereto, and after consultation
with the Board, the Minister may approve a planning policy document, with or
without modifications.

The Minister shall cause every approved planning policy document to be
(4)
published  and  made  available  at  the  Department  to  members  of  the  public  in
documentary form at a reasonable price and in electronic form on the internet.

For the avoidance of doubt, it is declared that an approved planning policy
(5)
document  constitutes  a  material  consideration  for  the  purposes  of  section
32(2).

the carrying out by or on behalf of the highway authority of any works
required  for  the  maintenance  or  improvement  of  a  road,  where  the

(f)

in the case of buildings or other land which are used for a purpose of
any class specified in an Use Class Order made by the Minister under
this section, the use thereof for any other purpose of the same class.

For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that for the purposes of

(3)
this section

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

the  use  as  two  or  more  separate  dwelling  units  of  any  building
previously used as a single dwelling house involves a material change

the deposit of any waste material on land involves a material change
in the use of the land, notwithstanding that the deposit is on land which
has been previously used for that purpose, if either the superficial area
thereof or the height of the deposit is thereby extended and exceeds the
level of land adjoining the site;

35

(e)

building or engineering operations for or involving the demolition or
alteration of a listed building or other monument or the disturbance of
a listed site, or involving the demolition or alteration of a building in
a  Heritage  Conservation  Area,  constitutes  development  requiring
planning permission;

(f)

the carrying out of building, engineering, mining or other operations
in, on, over or under any land used for agriculture or forestry, or the
subdivision of any such land, involves development of that land; and

(g)

for which the subdivided land is intended constitutes development.

Permission required for development of land

21.(1)
or carry out any development of land in Barbados.

Planning permission granted under this Act is required to commence

For the purposes of subsection (1), a person is deemed to have commenced
(2)
the development of land (until the contrary is proved, the burden of which lies
on the alleged developer) if that person has commenced the clearing of land, the
filling of ponds or wetlands, the laying out of roads or drains, the laying of water
pipes, the construction of any building, or any preparatory work which might
indicate an intention to improve the land or increase its value or make it in any
way ready for any type of development.

Where land is being used temporarily for some purpose, other than the
(3)
purpose for which it is normally used, planning permission is not required for the
resumption of the use of the land for the purpose for which it is normally used.

Where  land  is  normally  used  for  one  purpose  and  was  also  used  on
(4)
occasions,  whether  at  regular  intervals  or  not,  for  another  purpose,  planning
permission is not required for the use of the land for that other purpose on similar
occasions.

36

(5)
Where  land  is  unoccupied  but  been  occupied  at  some  time,  planning
permission is not required for the use of the land for the purpose for which it was
last used.

(6)
Where planning permission has been granted for a limited period, planning
permission is not required for the resumption, at the end of that period, of the use
of the land for the purpose for which it was normally used before such permission
was granted.

In determining for the purposes of subsections (3), (4), and (5) respectively,
(7)
what were the purposes for which land was normally used or last used, account
shall not be taken of any use of land begun in contravention of previous planning
control.

In determining for the purpose of subsection (6) what were the purposes
(8)
for which the land was normally used before the grant of planning permission
for  a  limited  period,  account  shall  not  be  taken  of  any  land  use  begun  in
contravention of this Part or in contravention of previous planning control.

Where  planning  permission  is  granted  subject  to  limitations  by  a
(9)
development order, planning permission is not required for the use of that land
which (apart from its use for the permitted development) is the normal use of that
land, unless the last-mentioned use was begun in contravention of this Part or in
contravention of previous planning control.

For the purposes of this section, a use of land was begun in contravention
(10)
of previous planning control if it was begun in contravention of the provisions
of the Town and Country Planning Act, Cap. 240, or of any development order
or Regulations made under that Act.

Applications to determine whether permission is required

22.(1)
Any person who proposes to carry out any operations in, on, over or
under land, or to make a change in the use of any land or building, and wishes to
determine whether such an act would constitute or involve the development of
land, and whether such an act constitutes permitted development pursuant to a

37

development order or an application for planning permission is required under
this Part, may apply to the Chief Town Planner to determine that question.

An  application  made  under  this  section  may  be  made  without  any
(2)
application for planning permission having been submitted, on payment of the
prescribed fee, and every such application shall be determined by the Chief Town
Planner within 14 days of the date of submission.

For  the  avoidance  of  doubt,  it  is  hereby  declared  that  the  question  of
(3)
whether an application for planning permission is required is inherent in every
application for planning permission submitted and, in the event that the Chief
Town Planner determines that the proposed acts do not involve the development
of land or an application for planning permission is not required, the Chief Town
Planner  shall  notify  the  applicant,  cancel  the  application  and  refund  the
application  fee  paid  by  the  applicant,  less  the  fee  payable  with  respect  to  an
application made under this section.

Where  an  application  is  made  in  accordance  with  subsection  (2),  if  the
(4)
Chief  Town  Planner  fails  to  determine  the  application  within  28  days,  or  the
applicant  is  dissatisfied  with  the  decision  of  the  Chief  Town  Planner  on  the
question of whether the proposed act constitutes permitted development pursuant
to a development order or an application for planning permission is required, the
applicant may submit the question for determination by way of an appeal to the
Tribunal under Part XI.

Development Orders

23.(1)
order”) provide for the grant of planning permission under this Part.

The Minister may by order (in this Act referred to as a “development

A development order may be made in respect of the whole of Barbados or
(2)
any area thereof and, where it is made in respect of an area of Barbados, shall
define in writing, or on a map of a scale which shows the boundaries definitively,
the extent and boundaries of that area.

(3)

A development order may

38

(a)

(b)

grant  planning  permission  for  any  class  or  type  of  development
specified  in  the  order  (in  this  Act  referred  to  as  “permitted
development”), either unconditionally or subject to such conditions or
limitations as may be specified in the order;

provide for the grant of planning permission in any other case by the
Board or the Minister, as the case may be, on an application in that
behalf made in accordance with the order.

Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (3)(a), a development

(4)
order which confers planning permission for any development may

(a)

(b)

where  planning  permission  is  thereby  granted  for  the  erection,
extension or alteration of any buildings, require the grant of planning
permission on an application made in that behalf to be obtained with
respect to the design or external appearance thereof; or

where  planning  permission  is  thereby  granted  for  development  of  a
specified class, enable the Minister to direct that the permission shall
not apply either in relation to development in any particular area or in
relation to any particular development.

In a development order made under this section, the Minister shall not grant
(5)
planning permission for any type of development in a coastal zone management
area established under the Coastal Zone Management Act, Cap. 394 which is
prohibited by a coastal zone management plan approved in accordance with that
Act.

To  enable  development  to  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  planning
(6)
permission granted under this Part, or otherwise to promote proper development
in accordance with the development plan, a development order may direct that
any Act, statutory instrument or other enactment which was in force before the
date of commencement of this Act, or any statutory instruments made (whether
before or after that day) under such Act or other enactment shall not apply to any

39

development  specified  in  the  order,  or  shall  apply  thereto  subject  to  such
modifications as may be specified.

Consultation before applying for planning permission

24.(1)
The  Minister  may  by  a  development  order  require  a  person  who
proposes  to  make  an  application  for  planning  permission  for  a  proposed
development,  of  a  class  specified  in  the  order,  carry  out  consultations  on  the
proposed  application  in  accordance  with  this  section  before  making  the
application.

A person required to carry out consultations with respect to a proposed
(2)
development  shall  consult  the  Chief  Town  Planner  and  such  other  regulatory
agencies or persons as the Chief Town Planner may specify.

A person subject to the duty imposed by this section shall have regard to
(3)
the advice given by the Chief Town Planner and other persons duly consulted
with respect to the plans, studies and other information that will be required by
the Department and other regulatory agencies in order to determine the proposed
application expeditiously.

When an application is made following consultations carried out pursuant
(4)
to this section, the fees payable with respect to consultations before applying for
planning permission shall be offset against the application fee payable by the
applicant.

Approval in principle

25.(1)
Any person who intends to apply for a planning permission may make
application to the Board for approval in principle of the proposed development
at the conceptual stage, before preparing detailed plans.

An  application  for  approval  in  principle  shall  be  made  on  the  form
(2)
prescribed by the Chief Town Planner accompanied by such conceptual plans
and other information as the Chief Town Planner requires for its evaluation.

40

(3)
The information which the Chief Town Planner may require pursuant to
subsection  (2)  includes  an  initial  environmental  evaluation  of  the  proposed
development.

(4)
The Board may grant approval in principle, with or without conditions,
subject to the subsequent approval of any matter reserved until detailed plans and
further  information,  including  but  not  limited  to  an  environmental  impact
assessment, have been submitted, or may refuse to grant approval in principle.

For the avoidance of doubt, approval in principle granted under subsection
(5)
(4) is not permission to commence development and the applicant shall comply
with the provisions of section 26 before planning permission is granted.

Where  the  Board  is  of  the  opinion  that  an  application  for  approval  in
(6)
principle  ought  not  to  be  considered  without  the  submission  of  the  detailed
information required for an application for planning permission under section 26,
the  Chief  Town  Planner  shall  notify  the  applicant  forthwith  that  the  Board  is
unable to determine the application for approval in principle.

Where after the grant of approval in principle, further information becomes
(7)
available to the Board, or a situation subsequently arises, whereby in the opinion
of the Board the proposed development would be detrimental to the environment,
the  cultural  or  natural  heritage,  public  health,  safety  or  welfare,  or  would
constitute a potential danger to national security, approval in principle granted
under this section may be revoked or modified by the Board, by notice in writing
which  specifies  the  reasons  for  the  modification  or  revocation,  without  any
compensation.

Applications for planning permission

26.(1)
Town Planner and shall be

An application for planning permission shall be submitted to the Chief

(a)

made in such form and include such drawings and other particulars as
may be prescribed by regulations; and

41

(b)

accompanied by proof of payment of the appropriate application fee
prescribed by regulations.

(2)
The Chief Town Planner may cancel an application made under this Part
and return it to the applicant with a notice to that effect, within 28 days of the
receipt of the application, where the Chief Town Planner is of the opinion that
the application is premature, having regard to

(a)

(b)

(c)

the means of access to the land to which the application relates and the
need  to  make  provision  or  better  provision  for  access  before
development can be permitted;

any existing deficiency in the provision of water or electricity supplies
to the land to which the application relates and the period within which
any such deficiency may reasonably be expected to be made good; or

the prejudicial effect that determination of the application would have
on the formulation of a physical development plan for the area in which
the land to which the application relates is situated.

When an application is withdrawn by the applicant, or is cancelled pursuant
(3)
to subsection (2), the applicant is not entitled to a refund of any application fee
paid with respect to that application or to any form of compensation.

Requirements for further information

27.(1)
applicant for planning permission to

The  Chief  Town  Planner  may,  by  notice  in  writing,  require  an

(a)

(b)

submit,  within  such  time  as  may  be  prescribed  in  the  notice,  such
further information as may be specified in the notice as the Chief Town
Planner considers necessary to enable the Board or the Minister, as the
case may be, to determine the application; or

without  prejudice  to  the  generality  of  paragraph  (a),  cause  an
environmental impact assessment of the proposed development to be
carried  out  pursuant  to  section  30  and  an  environmental  impact
statement to be submitted to the Chief Town Planner.

42

(2)
The power of the Chief Town Planner to require further information under
subsection (1)(a) is exercisable once with respect to each application and shall
be exercised within 28 days of submission of the application.

(3)
Where  further  information  is  required  under  paragraphs  (a)  or  (b)  of
subsection (1), the application is treated as having been made on the date when
the  further  information  was  submitted,  so  that  the  period  provided  for  the
determination of the application specified in section 34(1) does not commence
until the date of receipt of the further information.

Where  an  applicant  does  not  furnish  the  Chief  Town  Planner  with  the
(4)
further information required under paragraphs (a) or (b) of subsection (1) within
the period specified in the notice, or such longer period as may be agreed upon
between the applicant and the Chief Town Planner, the Chief Town Planner may
cancel the application and may return it to the applicant with a notice to that
effect,  or  the  Board  or  the  Minister,  as  the  case  may  be,  may  refuse  to  grant
planning permission, as they think fit.

When an application is cancelled pursuant to subsection (4), the applicant
(5)
is  not  entitled  to  a  refund  of  any  application  fee  paid  with  respect  to  that
application or to any form of compensation.

Coordination with referral agencies

Any referral agency which receives a request in writing from the Chief
28.(1)
Town  Planner  for  their  technical  advice  on  an  application  shall  reply  to  that
request within the period, being not more than 21 days, specified in the request
made by the Chief Town Planner.

In specifying the period within which a referral agency shall reply to a
(2)
request for technical advice, the Chief Town Planner shall have regard to the
period  within  which  the  application  shall  be  determined  specified  in  section
34(1).

For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that if a referral agency,
(3)
omits to submit their comments on an application to the Chief Town Planner
within the period specified in the request for comments, the comments of that

43

agency may be disregarded by the Board or the Minister, as the case may be, in
determining the application.

Publicity for applications

29.(1)
A development order may make provision requiring notice to be given
of  any  application  of  a  specified  class  and  provide  for  publicising  such
applications and for the form, contents and service of such notices.

Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), such publicity shall

(2)
be required with respect to

(a)

(b)

(c)

any  application  for  which  an  environmental  impact  assessment  is
required pursuant to section 30;

any application of strategic economic or environmental significance
which is to be referred to the Minister pursuant to section 33; and

any application for development that is inconsistent in some material
respect with an approved physical development plan for the area in
which the proposed development is located.

In determining an application to which this section relates, the Board or
(3)
the  Minister,  as  the  case  may  be,  shall  take  into  account  any  objection,
representation  or  comment  submitted  or  made  with  respect  to  the  application
under this section.

Where the applicant fails to comply with the requirements of a notice given
(4)
under subsection (1) the Chief Town Planner shall determine that the application
has been withdrawn by the applicant and may cancel and return the application
to the applicant.

When an application is cancelled pursuant to subsection (4), the applicant
(5)
is  not  entitled  to  a  refund  of  any  application  fee  paid  with  respect  to  that
application or to any form of compensation

44

Environmental Impact Assessment

30.(1)
The  Chief  Town  Planner  may  require  an  environmental  impact
assessment to be carried out by the applicant in respect of any application for
permission to develop land, if the proposed development, by reason of its nature,
scale or location, could significantly affect the environment.

Unless the Minister directs otherwise, the Chief Town Planner shall require
(2)
an  environmental  impact  assessment  in  respect  of  an  application  for  a
development of any kind mentioned in the Third Schedule.

The Board or the Minister, as the case may be, may not grant permission
(3)
for  the  development  of  land  pursuant  to  an  application  to  which  this  section
applies  unless  an  environmental  impact  statement  has  first  been  taken  into
account.

The  Minister  shall  make  environmental  impact  assessment  regulations

(4)
providing for

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

the criteria and procedures for determining whether an activity is likely
to significantly affect the environment so that an environmental impact
assessment  may  be  required  in  addition  to  the  information  that  the
applicant is ordinarily required to submit;

the procedures for settling the scope of works of the environmental
impact assessment to be carried out by the applicant in respect of any
development;

the  minimum  contents  of  an  environmental  impact  statement  to  be
submitted to the Chief Town Planner in respect of the environmental
impact assessment carried out by the applicant;

the  qualifications,  skills,  knowledge  or  experience  which  shall  be
possessed  by  persons  conducting  environmental  impact  assessment
studies for the purposes of this Act;

45

(e)

(f)

(g)

the  procedures  for  public  participation  in  the  environmental  impact
assessment process and public scrutiny of the environmental impact
statement submitted to the Chief Town Planner;

the  procedure  and  criteria  for  review  of  the  environmental  impact
statement; and

the consideration by the Board of an application with respect to which
an environmental impact assessment has been required.

When the Chief Town Planner notifies an applicant that an environmental
(5)
impact  assessment  is  required,  the  Department  and  any  other,  including  any
statutory undertaker, if requested by the applicant, shall enter into consultation
with  the  applicant  to  determine  whether  that  department  or  agency  of
Government has in its possession any information which the applicant considers
relevant to the environmental impact assessment and, if it does, the department
or  agency  of  Government  shall  make  any  such  information  available  to  the
applicant and allow the applicant to take copies on payment of the cost of making
the  copies,  but  is  not  required  to  disclose  any  confidential  information  to  the
applicant  or  to  do  anything  that  contravenes  the  provisions  of  the  Copyright
Act, Cap. 300.

When a notice requiring an applicant to carry out an environmental impact
(6)
assessment  is  issued,  the  Chief  Town  Planner  shall  notify  any  department  or
agency of the Government of Barbados having responsibility for the issue of any
licence,  permit,  approval,  consent  or  other  document  of  authorisation  in
connection with any matter affecting the development.

A department or agency of the Government of Barbados that has been given
(7)
notice  in  accordance  with  subsection  (6),  may  not  grant  its  licence,  permit,
approval, consent or other document of authorisation, unless it has been notified
by  the  Chief  Town  Planner  that  the  notice  has  been  complied  with  and  that
planning permission has been granted for the proposed development.

For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that in addition to the
(8)
application fee prescribed with respect to an application for planning permission

46

for which an environmental impact assessment is required, if any, the applicant
may be liable to an additional fee for the review of the environmental impact
statement, payable upon submission of the environmental impact statement for
review.

Permission to regularise unauthorised development

The power of the Board to grant planning permissions under this Part
31.(1)
includes power to grant permission for the retention on land of any buildings or
works constructed or carried out before the date of the application, or for the
continuation of any use of land instituted before that date, and references in this
Part to planning permission and to applications for planning permission are to be
construed accordingly.

Any planning permission granted in accordance with subsection (1) may
(2)
take effect from the date on which the buildings or works were constructed or
carried out, or the use was instituted.

In  the  case  of  buildings  or  works  constructed  or  a  use  instituted  in
(3)
accordance with planning permission granted for a limited period, any planning
permission granted in accordance with subsection (1) may be granted so as to
take effect from the end of that period.

The application fee payable with respect to an application for the retention
(4)
of  unauthorised  development  to  which  this  section  applies,  as  prescribed  by
regulations made under section 104, shall exceed the application fee ordinarily
payable with respect to applications for prior permission for the same class of
development.

Determination of applications by the Board

When  an  application  for  permission  to  develop  land,  other  than  an
32.(1)
application to which section 33 relates, is duly made, the application shall be
dealt with by the Department and submitted, together with a statement containing
the observations and recommendations of the Chief Town Planner, to the Board
for determination.

47

(2)
The Board shall have regard to the provisions of the physical development
plan for the area within which the land is situated, if any, and to any other material
considerations, and, subject to subsection (3), may grant planning permission,
either unconditionally or subject to conditions, or refuse permission.

Where  the  Board  grants  planning  permission  subject  to  conditions  or
(3)
refuses permission, the Board shall give reasons in writing for its decision in the
notice of planning permission or refusal, as the case may be.

In determining an application for planning permission, the Board, shall be
(4)
guided by a presumption in favour of granting planning permission and, where
it appears that a proposed development which would otherwise be refused can
be permitted subject to conditions if the application is modified, the Board shall
issue  to  the  applicant  a  notice  of  provisional  refusal  which  specifies  the
modifications to the development proposal that are required before permission
may be granted.

Where  an  applicant  to  whom  a  notice  of  provisional  refusal  is  issued
(5)
consents  to  modify  the  development  proposal  as  specified,  and  makes  the
modifications within such time as may be prescribed in the notice, the Board shall
cancel  the  provisional  refusal  and  grant  planning  permission  subject  to  such
conditions as it sees fit.

Where  an  applicant  to  whom  a  notice  of  provisional  refusal  is  issued
(6)
consents  to  modify  the  development  proposal  but  requests  an  opportunity  to
negotiate with respect to the required modifications, the Board shall enter into
such  negotiations  with  the  applicant  for  up  to  28  days,  and  shall  cancel  the
provisional refusal and grant planning permission, subject to such conditions as
are agreed, if the issues in contention are resolved in the negotiations, or otherwise
shall confirm the refusal of planning permission.

Where an applicant to whom a notice of provisional refusal is issued does
(7)
not consent to modify the development as specified in the notice and does not
opt  to  enter  into  negotiations  with  respect  to  the  required  modifications  or
proposed conditions within 28 days of the date of issue of the notice, the Board
shall confirm the refusal of planning permissions.

48

For the avoidance of doubt, it is declared that the considerations which the

(8)
Board shall take into account in determining an application include

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

(f)

the advice of the Chief Town Planner;

any other further information submitted by the applicant in support of
the application pursuant to section 27;

the comments made by any referral agency or other statutory body or
person  consulted  by  the  Chief  Town  Planner  with  respect  to  the
application pursuant to section 28;

the objections, representations or comments made by any person with
respect to an application which has been publicised pursuant to section
29;

the  proposed
the  environmental
development submitted to the Chief Town Planner pursuant to section
30, if any; and

impact  statement  concerning

where the land is located in a coastal zone management area established
under the Coastal Zone Management Act, Cap. 394, the provisions of
the coastal zone management plan approved in accordance with that
Act, if any.

Without  restricting  the  generality  of  subsection  (2),  conditions  may  be

(9)
imposed on the grant of planning permission to develop land

(a)

regulating the development or use of any land under the ownership of
the  applicant,  whether  or  not  it  is  land  in  respect  of  which  the
application  was  made,  including  the  discontinuance  of  any  existing
uses of the land or requiring the carrying out of works on such land, so
far  as  appears  to  the  Board  expedient  for  the  purposes  of  or  in
connection with the development authorised by the permission;

(b)

requiring  the  removal  of  any  buildings  or  works  authorised  by  the
permission, or the discontinuance of any use of land so authorised, at

49

the end of a specified period, and the carrying out of any works required
for re-instatement of the land at the expiration of that period;

(c)

(d)

requiring the commencement or completion of any development before
a  specified  date  or  on  or  before  the  completion  of  any  other
development to be carried out by the same applicant;

requiring  the  provision  of  proper  services  including  gas,  water,
electricity,  telecommunications  and  roads,  before  the  sale,  lease  or
other disposition of any land for which permission for subdivision for
residential, commercial or industrial purposes is given.

Any  planning  permission  granted  subject  to  any  such  condition  as  is
(10)
mentioned in subsection (9)(b) is referred to in this Act as “planning permission
for a limited period”.

(11)

Where

(a)

planning  permission  is  granted  for  development  consisting  of  or
including the carrying out of building or other operations subject to a
condition that shall be commenced or completed before a date specified
in the condition; and

(b)

any building or other operations are commenced or completed after the
date so specified,

then

(i)

(ii)

the commencement and carrying out of those operations in the case
of a condition requiring the commencement of those operations
before a date specified in the condition; or

the carrying out of any operations after the date specified in the
conditions, in the case of a condition requiring those operations to
be completed before such date,

do not constitute development for which that permission was granted.

50

(12)
For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that, where the Board has
delegated  the  power  to  determine  applications  to  the  Chief  Town  Planner
pursuant to section 10, the provisions of this section apply mutatis mutandis to
the determination of applications by the Chief Town Planner as they apply to the
determination of applications by the Board.

Referral of applications to the Minister

33.(1)
The Minister may give directions to the Chief Town Planner requiring
that any application or class of applications for planning permission specified in
the  direction,  being  development  which  would  involve  either  a  significant
departure  from  the  approved  physical  development  plan  or  is  of  strategic
economic  or  environmental  significance,  shall  be  referred  to  the  Minister  for
determination.

Where an application which is to be referred to the Minister under this
(2)
section is duly made, the application shall be dealt with by the Department and
submitted,  together  with  a  statement  containing  the  observations  and
recommendations of the Chief Town Planner, to the Minister for determination.

Where an application for planning permission is referred to the Minister
(3)
under this section the Chief Town Planner shall give notice to the applicant and
any  other  person  who  has  duly  made  an  objection  to  the  grant  of  planning
permission  when  the  application  was  publicised  pursuant  to  section  29
(hereinafter referred to as “the objector”), of the referral of the application to the
Minister.

Before determining an application under this section, the Minister shall, if
(4)
the  Chief  Town  Planner,  the  applicant  or  the  objector  so  desires,  give  the
aforementioned parties an opportunity to present their case in writing or appear
before and be heard by a person, being a member of the Tribunal, appointed by
the President for that purpose.

A hearing referred to in subsection (4) shall be conducted within 42 days
(5)
of the date on which the completed application is submitted in accordance with

51

the  procedures  with  respect  to  the  conduct  of  such  hearings  prescribed  by
regulations.

A person appointed to conduct a hearing under subsection (5) shall, within
(6)
21 days of the completion of the hearing, submit a report on the findings and
conclusions of the hearing to the Minister and copies of every such report shall
be  provided  to  the  Chief  Town  Planner  and  the  applicant,  and  shall  be  made
available for perusal by any member of the public in documentary form at the
office of the Department and in electronic form on the internet.

The provisions of section 32 apply, with any necessary modifications, to
(7)
the  determination  of  an  application  by  the  Minister  as  they  apply  to  the
determination of an application by the Board.

Where an application is referred to the Minister for determination under
(8)
this  section,  the  Minister  shall  give  notice  of  the  decision  on  that  application
within 21 days of receipt of the report of the person appointed to conduct the
hearing, pursuant to subsection (6).

The  decision  of  the  Minister  made  on  any  application  referred  to  the

(9)
Minister under this section is final.

Limitation Periods

34.(1)
Where an application for planning permission to be determined by the
Board is duly made, the Chief Town Planner shall issue a notice of the Board’s
decision

(a)

(b)

in  the  case  of  an  application  for  which  an  environmental  impact
assessment  has  been  submitted,  within  12  weeks  from  the  date  of
submission of the environmental impact statement;

in  the  case  of  an  application  classified  in  the  First  Schedule  as  a
complex  application,  other  than  an  application  for  which  an
environmental impact assessment has been submitted, within a period
of 10 weeks, from the date of submission of the application;

52

(c)

(d)

in the case of any other application, within a period of 6 weeks from
the date of submission of the application; or

in  any  case,  such  extended  period  as  may  be  agreed  to  in  writing
between the Chief Town Planner and the applicant.

Unless notice of the Board’s decision is issued within the period prescribed
(2)
by subsection (1), the provisions of section 35 apply in relation to the application
as if it had been refused.

For the avoidance of doubt it is declared that planning permission issued
(3)
after the expiry of the applicable period prescribed in subsection (1) is valid, and
an  applicant  may  choose  to  accept  the  benefit  of  such  permission  instead  of
appealing against the decision pursuant to section 35.

Right of Appeal

If a planning permission is refused by the Board, or is granted by the
35.(1)
Board subject to conditions, an applicant, or any other person having an interest
in  the  land  (except  a  mortgagee  not  in  possession),  who  is  aggrieved  by  the
decision of the Board may, within 28 days from the date of the decision, appeal
in writing against that decision to the Tribunal in accordance with Part XI, setting
out the grounds upon which the appeal is made.

For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that the right to appeal
(2)
against decisions of the Board under this section includes a right to appeal against
any such decision made by the Chief Town Planner or any other officer of the
Department under powers delegated by the Board pursuant to section 10.

Planning obligations

36.(1)
Where a person applies for planning permission under this Act, the
Crown may, on the advice of the Board and with the consent of the Minister,
enter into an agreement with that person or, if that person is not the owner of the
land to which the application relates, the owner of the land, and the agreement
shall contain such obligations as the Board thinks fit.

53

Without  restricting  the  generality  of  subsection  (1),  the  obligations

(2)
included in the agreement may

(a)

(b)

(c)

cover matters in respect of which conditions may not be imposed on a
planning permission;

impose  an  obligation  indefinitely  or  for  such  period  as  may  be
specified, unconditionally or subject to conditions;

provide for the making of a contribution (whether of works, money or
land)  by  the  applicant  towards  the  provision  of  services,  facilities
(including their future maintenance) and amenities in the area in which
the proposed development is to be carried out; or

(d)

provide for a performance bond or other financial security for ensuring
due compliance with the agreement by the applicant.

An agreement made under this section shall be entered into by way of an

(3)
instrument executed as a deed that

(a)

states  that  the  obligation  imposed  by  the  agreement  are  planning
obligations for the purposes of this section;

(b)

identifies the land in respect of which the obligation is being made;

(c)

(d)

identifies the person entering into the obligation; and

states the interest that the person entering into the obligation has in the
land.

An agreement made under this section shall be a charge on the land that is
(4)
the subject of the planning permission and shall be recorded in the Land Registry
in accordance with the provisions of the Land Registration Act, Cap. 229.

Any such agreement is binding on the person entering into the agreement
(5)
and any person deriving title from that person, until it is discharged in accordance
with the provisions of the Land Registration Act, Cap. 229.

Notwithstanding subsection (5), such an agreement may provide that the
(6)
person  entering  into  the  agreement  is  not  bound  by  the  agreement  when  that

54

person no longer has any interest in the land to which the planning permission
relates.

Where there is a breach of a requirement in an agreement entered into under
(7)
this section, to carry out any operations in, on, over or under any land to which
the obligation relates, the Minister

(a)

(b)

may cause any person to enter the land and carry out the operations;
and

recover as a civil debt any expenses reasonably incurred in doing so
from the person against whom the obligation is enforceable, in a court
of competent jurisdiction.

Before taking any action pursuant to subsection (7), the Minister shall give
(8)
not less than 21 days notice to any person against whom the planning obligation
is enforceable.

Modification and discharge of planning obligations

A planning obligation may be modified by an instrument executed as
37.(1)
a deed between the parties to the agreement entered into pursuant to section 36
or in accordance with subsection (3).

(2)

A planning obligation may be discharged in accordance with this section.

A person against whom a planning obligation is enforceable may at any
(3)
time after the expiry of the period prescribed in the agreement or, where no such
period is prescribed, 5 years from the date on which the obligation is entered into,
apply to the Minister for the obligation

(a)

to  have  effect  subject  to  such  modifications  as  are  specified  in  the
application; or

(b)

to be discharged.

55

Where  an  application  is  made  under  subsection  (3),  the  Minister  may

(4)
determine

(a)

(b)

(c)

that the obligation shall continue to have effect without modification;

where the obligation no longer serves a useful purpose, that it shall be
discharged; or

where the obligation continues to serve a useful purpose, but would
serve  that  purpose  equally  well  if  it  had  effect  subject  to  the
modifications specified in the application, or any of them, that it shall
have effect subject to such modifications.

The Minister shall give notice of the determination made under subsection

(5)
(4) to the applicant not later than 3 months after the application is made.

Where the Minister determines that a planning obligation shall have effect
(6)
subject to any modification, the modified obligation shall be enforceable as if it
had been entered into on the date on which the notice of the determination of the
application for modification was given to the applicant.

Where the Minister fails to give notice of a determination in accordance
(7)
with subsection (5) or determines that a planning obligation shall continue to
have effect without modification, the applicant may appeal to the Tribunal in
writing against that decision in accordance with Part XI, setting out the grounds
upon which the appeal is made.

Where the Minister fails to give notice of a determination in accordance
(8)
with subsection (5), it shall be assumed for the purposes of an appeal that the
Minister  has  determined  that  the  planning  obligations  shall  continue  to  have
effect without modification.

Effect of planning permission

38.(1)
Without  prejudice  to  the  provisions  of  this  Part  as  to  the  lapse,
modification  or  revocation  of  planning  permission,  the  permission  granted
thereby enures for the benefit of the land and of all persons for the time being

56

having an interest in the land, unless the notice of planning permission expressly
provides otherwise.

Planning permission granted under this Act does not exempt any proposed
(2)
development from any regulatory requirements imposed upon such development
by or under any other enactment.

Duration of planning permission

39.(1)
Where no planning permission covering the same development has
been applied for within 2 years of the grant of approval in principle or such longer
period as may be specified in the notice of approval, that approval in principle
lapses and ceases to have any force or effect.

Planning permission is subject to a condition that it lapses and ceases to
(2)
have  effect  if  the  development  to  which  it  relates  has  not  been  substantially
commenced within 5 years of the grant of the planning permission, or such longer
period as may be authorised by the Board in any particular case.

Where planning permission provides for different parts of the development
(3)
to  commence  at  different  times,  the  provisions  of  this  section  apply  to  those
separate parts of the development as if planning permission was granted for each
separate part or stage of the development.

The  Board  may  serve  written  notice  on  a  person  who  has  commenced
(4)
development  pursuant  to  planning  permission  within  the  prescribed  time,
requiring that person to complete the development within the time specified in
such  notice,  and  stating  that  if  the  development  is  not  completed  within  that
period the planning permission will cease to have effect after the expiration of a
further period specified in the notice.

Upon expiration of the further period specified in a notice served under
(5)
subsection (4) the planning permission ceases to be valid or to have any effect
and any further development or work carried out with respect to the development
authorised by that planning permission is a breach of planning control.

57

(6)
For  the  purposes  of  this  section,  development  by  way  of  building,
engineering, mining or other operations or the subdivision of land is taken to be
substantially commenced on the earliest date on which either

(a)

(b)

all the operations below the surface level of the site have been carried
out; or

a registered architect or engineer certifies that 20 per cent or more of
the  building  or  engineering  operations  authorised  by  the  planning
permission have been carried out.

For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that no compensation is
(7)
payable with respect to any loss arising from the lapse of planning permission
under this section.

Any person upon whom a notice is served under subsection (4) may at any
(8)
time within the period specified therein for the completion of the development
appeal in writing to the Tribunal against the notice on the grounds that the time
allowed for compliance falls short of what should reasonably be allowed.

Non-material changes to planning permission

40.(1)
Whenever plans have been submitted to the Chief Town Planner in
application for planning permission and such permission has been granted, the
development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved plans and any
conditions imposed by the Board or the Minister, as the case may be.

The  Chief  Town  Planner  may  approve  any  minor  variation  to  plans
(2)
approved by the Board, provided that the variations do not materially alter or
affect the terms and conditions subject to which planning permission was granted,
and inform the Board of the action which has been taken in that particular case.

Where  the  Chief  Town  Planner  is  requested  to  approve  a  variation  to
(3)
approved  plans  under  subsection  (2),  but  is  of  the  opinion  that  the  proposed
variation will materially alter or affect the terms and conditions subject to which
planning  permission  was  granted,  the  Chief  Town  Planner  shall  inform  the
applicant in writing that a fresh application is required.

58

Completion of development

41.(1)
This  section  has  effect  where  planning  permission  is  subject  to  a
condition that the development to which the permission relates shall be carried
out  by  or  before  a  specified  date  and  the  development  is  begun  but  is  not
completed before the specified date.

Where, in the opinion of the Chief Town Planner, the development will
(2)
not be completed within a reasonable period after the specified date, the Board
may give notice (in this section referred to as a “completion notice”) that the
planning  permission  shall  cease  to  have  effect  at  the  expiration  of  a  period
specified in the notice, being not less than one year after the notice takes effect.

(3)

A completion notice

(a)

shall be served on the owner and occupier of the land and on any other
person who, in the opinion of the Chief Town Planner, will be affected
by the notice; and

(b)

takes effect within 28 days from the date of service on the owner of the
land, if and when it is confirmed by the Minister.

In  confirming  a  completion  notice,  the  Minister  may  substitute,  for  the
(4)
period specified in the notice, some longer period as the period at the expiration
of which the planning permission will cease to have effect.

Where  a  completion  notice  takes  effect,  at  the  expiration  of  the  period
(5)
specified  in  the  completion  notice  or  such  longer  period  substituted  by  the
Minister,  as  the  case  may  be,  the  planning  permission  referred  to  therein  is
invalid, except in so far as it authorises any development carried out under the
planning permission before the expiration of that period.

Any person upon whom a completion notice is served under this section
(6)
may appeal in writing against that decision to the Tribunal in accordance with
Part XI, setting out the grounds upon which the appeal is made.

59

Modification or revocation of planning permission

42.(1)
Subject to the provisions of this section, where it appears to the Board,
after consideration of such advice as may be given by the Chief Town Planner,
that it is desirable that any planning permission ought to be modified or revoked,
the Board may, with the consent of the Minister, by written notice to the person
entitled  to  the  benefit  of  the  permission,  revoke  or  modify  the  planning
permission to such extent as it considers desirable.

(2)

The power conferred on the Board by this section may be exercised

(a)

(b)

(c)

where the planning permission relates to the carrying out of building
or  other  operations,  at  any  time  before  those  operations  have  been
completed;

where the planning permission relates only to the making of a material
change  in  the  use  of  building  or  other  land,  at  any  time  before  the
change has taken place; and

where the planning permission relates to the subdivision of land, at any
time  before  the  subdivision  plan  has  been  recorded  in  the  Land
Registry.

The modification or revocation of a planning permission for the carrying
(3)
out of building or other operations does not affect so much of the operations as
has been previously carried out.

A notice of the modification or revocation of a planning permission under

(4)
this section shall include

(a)

(b)

(c)

a statement of the reasons for the modification or revocation;

such directions as the Board considers necessary for the bringing to an
end any development to which the notice relates;

information  as  to  any  claim  for  compensation  that  may  arise  in
consequence of the modification or revocation, and the procedure for
making any claim for compensation;

60

(d)

information as to the right of appeal to the Tribunal under Part XI of
this Act; and

(e)

such other matters as may be prescribed.

(5)
Upon the service of a notice under subsection (1), the planning permission
concerned  ceases  to  be  valid  or  to  have  effect  to  the  extent  to  which  the
modification  or  revocation  so  requires,  and  any  further  development  or  work
carried out contrary to such notice is a breach of planning control.

Notwithstanding  subsection  (5),  the  Board,  after  considering  any
(6)
representations  made  in  respect  of  such  a  notice,  may  at  any  time  cancel  or
withdraw that notice.

An appeal lies to the Tribunal under Part XI against the issue of a notice
(7)
by the Board under subsection (1), or against the refusal of the Board to cancel
or withdraw such notice under subsection (6).

Pending the determination of any such appeal referred to in subsection (7)
(8)
the notice concerned is deemed to be suspended in its operation, save that any
further development or work carried out is a breach of planning control.

Certificate of lawful use or development

43.(1)
A person who wishes to ascertain whether any operations which have
been carried out in, on, over or under any land, or any existing use of buildings
or other land or any other matter related to the development of land, is lawful,
may apply to the Chief Town Planner for that purpose, specifying the location of
the land and describing the operations or use or other matter in question.

For the purposes of this Act, any operations or material change in the use

(2)
of land are lawful at any time if

(a)

such  operations  or  uses  do  not  constitute  development  within  the
meaning of this Act;

61

(b)

(c)

(d)

the development is authorised by a grant of planning permission and
complies with any conditions subject to which such permission was
granted;

the development is permitted under a development order and complies
with any conditions and limitations subject to which such permission
was granted;

no enforcement action may be taken with respect to the carrying out of
the development, or any breach of the conditions or limitations subject
to  which  such  development  was  permitted,  because  the  time  for
enforcement action in respect of any such breach of planning control
has expired; or

(e)

the  operations  or  use  do  not  contravene  the  requirements  of  an
enforcement notice in force.

Where  on  an  application  under  this  section,  the  Chief  Town  Planner  is
(3)
satisfied that the operations or use of the land described in the application are
lawful, the Chief Town Planner shall issue a certificate to that effect, and in any
other case refuse the application.

(4)

A certificate under this section shall

(a)

(b)

(c)

specify the land to which it relates;

describe the operations or use or any other matter in question;

give reasons for determining that the operations or use or other matter
is lawful; and

(d)

specify the date of the application and the certificate.

The lawfulness of any operations, use or other matter for which a certificate
(5)
is in force under this section shall be conclusively presumed in any proceedings
whatsoever.

62

(6)
An appeal lies to the Tribunal under Part XI against the refusal of the Chief
Town  Planner  to  issue  a  certificate  of  lawful  use  or  development  under  this
section.

PART V

BUILDING, ENGINEERING AND SUBDIVISON PLANS

Building plans

44.(1)
An application for planning permission for building operations may
be  submitted  by  the  applicant,  or  an  agent  for  the  applicant,  but,  subject  to
subsection (3), building plans included in an application for planning permission
shall  be  signed  and  stamped  by  a  registered  professional  architect  or  civil
engineer.

A  registered  professional  architect  or  engineer  who  signs  and  stamps
(2)
building plans included in an application for planning permission is liable for
ensuring  that  such  plans  comply  with  the  Building  Code  and  Building
Regulations in force, if any.

A person who is not a registered professional architect or engineer may
(3)
prepare  and  sign  building  plans  submitted  in  an  application  for  planning
permission for

(a)

(b)

(c)

dwelling houses and duplex dwellings;

buildings of not more than 2 storeys containing more than 2 dwelling
units but less than 10 dwelling units; or

commercial buildings of no more than 465 square metres in gross floor
area and no more than two stories in height.

For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that the grant of planning
(4)
permission under this Act for the carrying out of building operations does not

63

affect any requirement for regulatory approval to be obtained in relation to such
buildings under any other enactment.

The Crown is exempt from any liability for negligence arising from the
(5)
grant of planning permission for building operations under this Act, whether the
building plans submitted in application for planning permission were prepared
by a registered professional architect or engineer or any other person.

Emergency engineering operations

Nothing  in  this  Act  shall  render  unlawful  the  carrying  out  of  any
45.(1)
engineering operations which are urgently necessary for coastal conservation or
sea defence, or in the interest of public safety or the preservation of property,
provided  that  an  application  for  planning  permission  to  regularise  the
unauthorised development is made to the Board, pursuant to section 31, as soon
as may be practicable after the necessity for the emergency works arises.

Where such an application is for the retrospective approval of emergency
(2)
works  undertaken  on  the  seabed  or  shoreline  for  the  purposes  of  coastal
conservation or sea defence, the application shall be accompanied by a certificate
issued by the Director of the Coastal Zone Management Unit verifying that the
engineering  operations  carried  out  without  prior  planning  permission  were
urgently necessary.

Subdivision plans

46.(1)
An  application  for  planning  permission  to  sub-divide  land  shall  be
made in the manner prescribed by section 26, accompanied by a layout plan of
the proposed subdivision drawn to scale and showing

(a)

(b)

the boundaries of the land proposed to be subdivided;

the  locations  and  widths  of  the  proposed  roads  within  the  proposed
subdivision and the locations, widths and names of existing roads on
to which the proposed subdivision abuts;

(c)

the purpose for which the proposed parcels are to be used;

64

(d)

the existing uses of all adjoining lands;

(e)

the approximate dimensions and layout of the proposed parcels;

(f)

(g)

(h)

(i)

(j)

(k)

natural and artificial features such as buildings or other structures or
installations, roads, watercourses, drainage ditches, wetlands, caves,
sinkholes and wooded areas within or adjacent to the land proposed to
be subdivided;

the nature and porosity of the soil;

existing contours or elevations as may be required to determine the
grade  of  the  highways  and  the  drainage  of  the  land  proposed  to  be
subdivided;

the public services, including water and electricity supply, available or
to be available to the land proposed to be subdivided;

the nature and extent of any restrictions affecting the land proposed to
be subdivided, including rights of way and other easements; and

a copy of the title deed or certificate of title in respect of the parcel of
land.

When the layout plan of the proposed subdivision is being considered by

(2)
the Board, regard shall be had, among other material considerations, to

(a)

whether the plan conforms to the physical development plan for the
area;

(b)

approved plans for the subdivision of adjacent lands, if any;

(c)

(d)

the  suitability  of  the  land  for  the  purposes  for  which  it  is  to  be
subdivided;

the  number,  width,  location  and  proposed  grades  and  elevations  of
roads, and the adequacy thereof, and the roads linking the roads in the
proposed subdivision with the established road system in the vicinity
and the adequacy thereof;

65

(e)

the dimensions and shapes of the proposed lots;

(f)

(g)

(h)

the adequacy of public utilities and services;

conservation of natural resources and flood control;

the area of land, if any, within the proposed subdivision that, exclusive
of  roads,  is  to  be  conveyed  or  dedicated  for  public  or  community
purposes; and

(i)

whether the proposed subdivision is premature or in the public interest.

The Board may impose such conditions with respect to the approval of a
(3)
plan  of  subdivision  as  are  reasonable,  having  regard  to  the  nature  of  the
development  proposed  for  the  subdivision,  including  but  not  limited  to
requirements that

(a)

(b)

an area of the land be dedicated for open space purposes in accordance
with the provisions of section 47; and

such roads within the subdivision be dedicated to the public as the Chief
Technical Officer of the Ministry responsible for highways considers
necessary.

Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (3), when the proposed
(4)
subdivision abuts upon an existing highway the Board may, in particular, impose
a condition that sufficient land, other than land occupied by buildings or other
structures, be dedicated to provide for the widening of that existing highway to
such  width  as  the  Board,  on  the  advice  of  the  Chief  Technical  Officer  of  the
Ministry responsible for highways, considers necessary.

Reservation of open space

47.(1)
The Board may, as a condition subject to which a planning permission
is granted for the subdivision of land to be laid out in residential building lots,
require the developer to reserve part of the land as an open space.

If  the  Board  requires  open  space  to  be  reserved  in  accordance  with
(2)
subsection (1), the developer shall carry out any operations required to make it

66

fit for the use for which it was reserved, in compliance with any conditions subject
to which permission was granted.

Transfer of open spaces

48.(1)
When land that has been reserved as an open space has been rendered
fit  for  the  use  for  which  it  was  reserved  in  accordance  with  section  47,  the
developer shall transfer the open space to

(a)

a body corporate that is representative of the owners of the building
lots in the subdivision; or

(b)

the Crown.

For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that no compensation or
(2)
purchase price is payable to the person who was at the date of transfer of title the
owner of the land with respect to an open space transferred to the Crown or any
other person pursuant to subsection (1), and no tax is payable with respect to any
such transfer.

A developer who opts to transfer the open space to the Crown, pursuant to
(3)
subsection (1), may be required to enter into a planning obligation agreement
pursuant to section 36 providing for the making of a financial contribution, either
periodically or on a specified date, to cover or contribute to the cost of future
maintenance of the open space by the Crown, and providing for financial security
for ensuring compliance with that obligation.

A completion certificate shall not be issued in respect of any development
(4)
to  which  this  section  applies  pursuant  to  section  50  until  the  developer  has
substantially complied with the requirements of subsection (1).

In order to ensure the preservation and use of the open space for the purpose
(5)
for which it was reserved, the Cabinet may place any land vested in the Crown
pursuant  to  this  section  under  the  management  of  the  National  Conservation
Commission  established  by  the  National  Conservation  Commission  Act,
Cap. 393 or such other body as it sees fit.

67

Provision of services in subdivisions

49.(1)
Where any engineering or other operations are necessary or expedient
for  the  purpose  of  laying  the  land  out  in  the  manner  in  which  it  is  being
subdivided,  the  developer  of  the  land  to  be  subdivided  shall  carry  out  any
operations on the land that the Board requires for providing infrastructure and
utilities to service the lots created by the subdivision of the land.

The operations that the Board may require the developer of the land to
(2)
carry  out  pursuant  to  subsection  (1)  include  the  provision  of  roads,  drains,  a
sewage  collection,  treatment  and  disposal  works,  water  mains,  fire  hydrants,
electricity supply, street lighting and telecommunications services.

Any engineering or other operations required to be carried out under this
(3)
section shall be carried out in the manner and to the standards specified by the
statutory bodies, authorities or statutory undertakers having functions and powers
under any other enactment with respect to the provision of roads, drains, sewage
collection, treatment and disposal works, water mains, fire hydrants, electricity
supply, street lighting and telecommunication services (in this Part referred to as
the “relevant authorities”) and approved by the relevant authorities prior to the
issue of a completion certificate issued pursuant to section 50.

Commencement and completion of works

50.(1)
Where  planning  permission  has  been  granted  for  building  or
engineering operations, including but not limited to engineering operations for
the provision of infrastructure in subdivisions, no such operations may be carried
out  until  the  developer  has  given  7  days  notice  in  writing  to  the  Chief  Town
Planner of the intention to commence works.

Where  the  Chief  Town  Planner  has  been  notified  in  writing  by  the
(2)
developer that building or engineering operations have been completed to the
satisfaction of and approved by the relevant authorities, the Chief Town Planner
shall  issue  a  completion  certificate  where  the  works  have  been  carried  out  in

68

accordance with the approved plans and the terms and conditions of the planning
permission.

In  the  case  of  the  subdivision  of  land,  no  transfer  of  parcels  in  the

(3)
subdivision may be registered in the Land Registry until

(a)

(b)

(c)

a  completion  certificate  for  any  engineering  operations  required  to
service parcels in the subdivision has been issued by the Chief Town
Planner pursuant to subsection (2);

a detailed survey of the subdivision has been carried out by a licensed
land surveyor and all the boundaries within the subdivision have been
marked  out  on  the  ground  in  accordance  with  the Land  Boundaries
(Land Survey) Regulations, 1993 (S.I. 1993 No. 55); and

the  survey  plan  of  the  subdivision  iscertified  by  the  licensed  land
surveyor has been submitted to the Board for approval and lodged in
the Land Registry.

Severance of a parcel of land

51.(1)
For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that the foregoing
provisions of this Part related to the subdivision of land do not apply where an
application for planning permission is made

(a)

to subdivide a parcel of land which abuts on to an existing right of way
access road or higher class of road, provided that each of the parcels
to be created

(i)

abuts on to the existing road or right of way;

(ii)

exceeds the minimum parcel size for residential lots;

(iii)

is adequately drained; and

(iv)

has independent access to a public water supply and electricity
distribution lines; or

69

(b)

to  make  adjustments  to  the  boundaries  of  parcels  of  land  or  create
rights of way or other easements over land.

In  subsection  (1),  “access  road”  has  the  meaning  assigned  to  it  by  the

(2)
Development Order.

In every case to which this section applies, after planning permission has
(3)
been granted, a survey plan of the approved subdivision, stamped and signed by
the licensed land surveyor shall be submitted to the Board for approval before
being lodged in the Land Registry.

PART VI

PROTECTION OF THE CULTURAL AND NATURAL HERITAGE

Interpretation of this Part

52.
served under this Part, unless the context otherwise requires:

In  this  Part  and  any  regulations,  orders,  or  notices  made,  given  or

“cultural heritage” includes

(a)

(b)

monuments namely buildings and other architectural works, works of
monumental  sculpture  and  painting,  elements  or  structures  of  an
archeological nature, inscriptions, cave dwellings and combinations of
features,  which  are  of  outstanding  value  from  the  point  of  view  of
history, art or science;

groups of buildings namely groups of separate or connected buildings
which, because of their architecture, their homogeneity or their place
in the landscape, are of outstanding value from the point of view of
history, art or science; and

(c)

sites namely works of man or the combined works of nature and of
man, and areas including archeological sites which are of outstanding

70

value  from  the  historical,  aesthetic,  ethnological  or  anthropological
points of view; and

“natural heritage” includes terrestrial and marine

(a)

(b)

natural  features  consisting  of  physical  and  biological  formations  or
groups of such formations, which are of outstanding value from the
aesthetic or scientific point of view;

geological and physiological formations and precisely delineated areas
which constitute the habitat of threatened species of animals and plants
of outstanding value from the point of view of science or conservation;

(c)

natural sites or precisely delineated natural areas of outstanding value
from the point of view of science, conservation or natural beauty.

Listing of cultural heritage buildings, monuments and sites

The Minister shall cause to be compiled lists of buildings, monuments
53.(1)
and sites of prehistoric, historic or architectural merit or interest, or may adopt,
with or without modifications, any such lists compiled by the Barbados National
Trust or other bodies or persons, and may amend any lists so compiled from time
to time.

Before the Minister compiles, adopts or amends any list under this section,

(2)
the Board shall cause reasonable steps to be taken to ensure that

(a)

(b)

adequate  publicity  is  given  to  the  proposed  listing  of  any  building,
monument or site; and

the owner and occupier of the building or land and any other person
who wishes to make any objections or representations with respect to
the proposed listing of any building, monument or site, is invited and
given an adequate opportunity to do so.

Any objections or representations made with respect to the proposal shall
(3)
be taken into account by the Minister in deciding whether the building, monument
or site should be listed.

71

(4)
As soon as may be practicable after the inclusion of any building or other
monument or site on any list compiled or adopted under subsection (1), or any
amendments to a list have been made, the Board shall serve notice on every owner
and occupier of the building or other monument or land stating that the building
or other monument or site has been included in or removed from the list, as the
case may be, and the Minister shall cause an order (in this Act referred to as a
“Cultural  Heritage  Preservation  Order”)  listing  the  affected  buildings,
monuments or sites to be published in the Official Gazette and a daily newspaper
in general circulation in Barbados.

The Chief Town Planner shall make an up to date copy of the list of cultural
(5)
heritage  buildings,  monuments  and  sites  published  in  the  Official  Gazette
available by inspection by members of the public, free of charge during normal
business hours, at the office of the Department, and shall publish an electronic
copy of the list on the internet.

For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that no compensation shall
(6)
be  payable  to  the  owner  of  any  property  included  in  a  Cultural  Heritage
Preservation  Order  which  depreciates  in  open  market  value  as  a  result  of  the
restrictions placed thereby on its use or development.

Effect of listing

Subject  to  this  section,  no  person  shall  execute  any  works  for  the
54.(1)
demolition  or  alteration  of  a  listed  building,  monument  or  site,  except  minor
works which would not materially affect its character, whether or not such works
would ordinarily constitute development or permitted development under this
Act, without applying for and receiving planning permission.

When the Board receives an application for planning permission for any
(2)
proposed works under subsection (1), the Board shall consult with the Barbados
National  Trust  andsuch  other  bodies  or  persons  having  special  knowledge  of
buildings, monuments and sites of prehistoric, historic or architectural merit or
interest, as may be specified by direction of the Minister, before granting planning
permission for the execution of the proposed works.

72

(3)
Subject to subsection (4), a person who executes or causes to be executed
any work for the demolition or alteration of a listed building, monument or the
disturbance of a listed site for which the Board has not granted prior planning
permission or in breach of any condition subject to which the Board granted such
permission, is guilty of an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine
of $500 000 or 10 years imprisonment or both.

Nothing in this section shall render unlawful the execution of any works
(4)
which  are  urgently  necessary  in  the  interests  of  safety  or  health  or  for  the
preservation of a listed building, monument or site, or of neighbouring property,
provided  that  an  application  for  planning  permission  to  regularise  the
unauthorised development is made to the Board, pursuant to section 31, as soon
as may be practicable after the necessity for the work arises.

An application for the retrospective approval of works to a listed building
(5)
or other monument or site, made pursuant to subsection (4), shall be accompanied
by a certificate issued by a registered professional architect or engineer verifying
that the building or engineering operations carried out without prior planning
permission were urgently necessary.

Interim protection

55.(1)
Where  it  appears  to  the  Minister  to  be  expedient  to  make  urgent
provision for the preservation of any unlisted building, monument or site, the
Minister may by order (in this Act referred to as an “Interim Listing Order”)
published in the Official Gazette and a daily newspaper in Barbados, restrict the
demolition, alteration or extension of that building, monument or disturbance of
that site.

(2)

An Interim Listing Order shall

(a)

(b)

specify the building or other monument or site to which it applies;

state the effect of the order and the date on which it comes into force;
and

73

(c)

invite  the  owners  and  occupiers  of  the  building  or  land  to  which  it
applies to make any objections or representations with respect to the
order within 28 days after it comes into force.

(3)

A copy of the Interim Listing Order shall

(a)

be posted or affixed in a prominent place on the building or land to
which it applies; and

(b)

served on every owner and occupier of the property to which it applies.

An Interim Listing Order remains in force for a period of 6 months and
(4)
ceases to have any effect at the end of that period unless the building, monument
or site to which it applies is listed by the Minister before the end of that period.

When an Interim Listing Order is in force with respect to any building,
(5)
monument or site, the provisions of this Act have effect in relation to it as if that
building, monument or site were a listed building, monument or site.

Where  any  works  have  been  carried  out  in  contravention  of  an  Interim
(6)
Listing Order, the Minister may require the restoration of the affected building
or other monument or site to its former state.

Where, after an Interim Listing Order has been issued, the Minister decides
(7)
not to list the building, monument or site to which the order relates, the Minister
shall not serve a fresh Interim Listing Order with respect to the same building,
monument or site within a period of 12 months from the date when the previous
notice ceased to have effect.

Conservation and rehabilitation of listed buildings, monuments and
sites

56.(1)
Every owner and occupier of a listed building, monument or site is
responsible for the conservation and rehabilitation of that building, monument
or site.

The Board shall, as far as practicable, assist the owners and occupiers of
(2)
listed  buildings,  monuments  and  sites  in  procuring  financial  and  technical

74

assistance  for  the  purposes  of  the  conservation  and  rehabilitation  of  such
buildings, monuments or sites.

Where any works have been carried out on a listed building, monument or
(3)
site in contravention of a Cultural Heritage Preservation Order or Interim Listing
Order, the Board may serve on the owner or occupier a notice requiring that such
steps as may be specified in the notice for restoring the building, monument or
site to its former state be taken within such period as may be so specified.

Where the owner or occupier of a listed building, monument or site neglects
(4)
or refuses to comply, within the specified time, with the requirements of a notice
served pursuant to subsection (3)

(a)

(b)

the Board may, enter upon the premises and take the steps required to
conserve  or  rehabilitate  the  listed  building,  monument  or  site  and
recover as a simple contract debt in any court any expenses reasonably
incurred for these purposes from the owner of the land; or

the Crown may compulsorily acquire the building, monument or site
in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Land  Acquisition  Act,
Cap. 228.

Heritage Conservation Areas

57.(1)
The Minister may by order (in this Act referred to as a “designation
order”) published in the Official Gazette, designate any area containing a group
of separate or connected buildings which, because of their history, architecture,
homogeneity or place in the landscape, are of outstanding cultural heritage value,
including such other land in the vicinity of that group of buildings as is necessary
to provide a peripheral protection belt or buffer zone, as an Heritage Conservation
Area.

Before making a designation order pursuant to subsection (1), the Minister

(2)
shall cause to be taken reasonable steps to ensure that

(a)

adequate  publicity  is  given  to  the  proposed  designation  of  the  area,
including where appropriate the holding of a public meeting; and

75

(b)

the owners and occupiers of buildings and land in the area, and any
other person who wishes to make objections or representations with
respect to the proposed designation of the area, are invited and given
an adequate opportunity to do so.

The Minister shall take any objections or representations made with respect
(3)
to the proposal are taken into account in deciding whether the area should be
designated.

The Minister shall, in a designation order, specify restrictions or conditions
(4)
for the protection of buildings and other land within a Heritage Conservation
Area.

Any person who, being the owner or occupier of a building or other land
(5)
within a Heritage Conservation Area, contravenes the restrictions or conditions
for  the  protection  of  buildings  or  other  land  within  that  area  specified  in  the
designation order, is guilty of an offence and is liable on summary conviction to
a fine of $250 000 or 5 years imprisonment or both.

Nothing in this section shall render unlawful the execution of any works
(6)
which  are  urgently  necessary  in  the  interests  of  safety  or  health  or  for  the
preservation of a building or other land within a Heritage Conservation Area,
provided  that  an  application  for  planning  permissions  to  regularise  the
unauthorised development is made to the Board, pursuant to section 31 as soon
as may be practicable after the necessity for the work arises.

An application for the retrospective approval of works to a building or other
(7)
land, made pursuant to subsection (6) shall be accompanied by a certificate issued
by a registered professional architect or engineer verifying that the building or
engineering  operations  carried  out  without  prior  planning  permission  were
urgently necessary.

For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that no compensation is
(8)
payable  to  the  owner  of  any  property  within  an  area  declared  as  a  Heritage
Conservation Area which depreciates in open market value as a result of any
restriction placed on its use or development by the designation order.

76

Protection of Natural Heritage

58.(1)
The  Minister  may  cause  to  be  compiled,  and  from  time  to  time
amended, lists of places of natural beauty or natural interest, including submarine
and subterranean areas, and their flora and fauna.

Where  the  Minister  is  of  the  view  that  it  is  desirable  to  afford  special
(2)
protection to any area on a list compiled under subsection (1), the Minister may
by order (in this Act referred to as a “protected area declaration”) published in
the Official Gazette declare that area to be a protected area.

Before making an order pursuant to subsection (2), the Minister shall take

(3)
reasonable steps to ensure that

(a)

(b)

adequate publicity is given to the proposed declaration within the area
which it proposes to protect, including if appropriate the holding of a
public meeting;

persons  who  may  wish  to  make  representations  with  respect  to  the
proposed declaration are invited and given an adequate opportunity to
make representations on the proposal; and

(c)

any  representations  made  on  the  proposal  are  taken  into  account  in
deciding whether the order should be made.

(4)

An order made under subsection (2) may

(a)

(b)

(c)

authorise the carrying out within the protected area of such works as
may be expedient for the protection or rehabilitation of the environment
in the area;

require  that  an  environmental  impact  assessment  be  carried  out  in
respect of every application for development within the area;

restrict or prohibit development, or development of any class, within
the area;

77

(d)

(e)

provide  for  the  control  over  the  use  of  land  within  the  area  for  the
purposes of agriculture, forestry or fisheries; or

restrict or prohibit the entry of persons into the area or the movement
of persons or the carrying out of activities by persons within the area.

Any person who, being the owner or occupier of land in relation to which
(5)
a protected area declaration is in force, contravenes any restrictions, prohibitions
or controls on the use of such land specified in the order or any other person who
enters  upon  such  land  and  carries  out  any  restricted  or  prohibited  activity  in
contravention  of  the  order  is  guilty  of  an  offence  and  is  liable  on  summary
conviction to a fine of $100 000 or 2 years imprisonment or both.

For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that no compensation shall
(6)
be payable to the owner of any land within an area declared as a protected area
which depreciates in open market value as a result of any restriction placed on
its use or development by the protected area declaration.

Tree preservation orders

59.(1)
Where it appears to the Minister that it is expedient in the interests of
amenity, soil conservation or the recovery or rehabilitation of areas degraded by
the clearance of vegetation, fire or any natural hazard event, to make provision
for the preservation of trees, groups of trees or woodlands in any part of Barbados,
then subject to this section, the Minister may for that purpose make an order (in
this  Act  referred  to  as  a  “tree  preservation  order”)  with  respect  to  such  trees,
groups of trees or woodlands as may be specified in the order.

(2)

Provision may be made in any tree preservation order for

(a)

for prohibiting (subject to any exemption specified in the order) the
felling, topping, lopping, or wilful damage to or destructions of trees,
except with the consent of the Board, and for any such consent to be
granted subject to conditions;

78

(b)

(c)

for securing the replanting, in such manner as may be prescribed by or
under the order, of any part of a wooded area which is felled in the
course of any operations permitted by or under the order; and

for  applying  in  relation  to  any  such  consent  under  the  order  and  to
applications for such consent, any of the provisions of Part IV relating
to  permission  to  develop  land  and  to  such  applications  for  such
permission, as may be specified in the order.

Every tree preservation order shall define the position of the group of trees
(3)
or woodlands to which it relates and for that purpose shall include a map of a
scale which shows definitively the boundaries of the area protected, or shall refer
to such a map kept for inspection at the Department.

Subsections (2), (3) and (4) of section 53 apply mutatis mutandis to the
(4)
making of tree preservation orders as they apply to the listing of cultural heritage
buildings, monuments and sites.

Without limiting the other exemptions for which provision may be made
(5)
by a tree preservation order, no such order applies to the cutting down, topping
or lopping of trees by a statutory undertaker in compliance with any obligation
imposed or in the exercise of any power conferred on them by any Act, statutory
instrument or other enactment.

Any  person  who  contravenes  a  tree  preservation  order  is  guilty  of  an
(6)
offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine of $50 000 and in the case
of a continuing offence, to a further fine of $1000 for every day after the first day
during which the contravention is so continued.

For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that no compensation shall
(7)
be payable to the owner of any tree, group of trees or woodland with respect to
any loss or expense incurred in consequence of the measures to preserve such
trees imposed by a tree preservation order.

This section takes effect subject to the provisions of the Cultivation of Trees
(8)
Act, Cap. 390 and the Trees (Preservation) Act, Cap. 397, governing licences and
permits to cut down trees.

79

Planning permission to include provisions concerning trees

60.(1)
Whenever it is appropriate, in granting planning permission for any
development,  the  Board  shall  ensure  that  adequate  provision  is  made  by  the
imposition of conditions for the preservation or planting of trees.

Where any planning permission is granted subject to conditions for the
(2)
preservation  or  planting  of  trees,  the  Board  may  require  the  applicant,  before
commencing the development permitted thereby, to deposit in a special account
in the Treasury an amount of money specified by the Board as security against
any failure to preserve or plant such trees.

Where an applicant fails to do anything in respect of which a deposit is
(3)
made under subsection (2), the Board may authorise the Chief Town Planner to
enter  upon  the  land  and  cause  such  thing  to  be  done  in  accordance  with  the
planning permission and deduct the costs thereof from the amount of the deposit.

Where there is an unexpended balance on the account after a deduction is
(4)
made under subsection (3), that balance shall be repaid to the applicant by the
Accountant-General, upon being made to the Accountant-General accompanied
by  proof  that  the  required  measures  for  the  preservation  or  planting  of  trees
development  have  been  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  conditions  of  the
planning permission.

Preservation of amenity

61.(1)
Where it appears to the Chief Town Planner that the amenity of any
part of Barbados is, or is likely to be, despoiled by the condition of any building,
vacant site or other open land, then, the Board may serve on the owner or occupier
of  the  building  or  other  land  a  notice  (in  this  Act  referred  to  as  an  “amenity
notice”) requiring that such steps to remediate the condition of the building or
other land as may be specified in the notice be taken within such period as may
be specified in the notice.

80

(2)
Subject to subsection (2) of section 63, an amenity notice under this section
takes effect at the end of such period, not being less than 28 days after the services
of the notice, as may be specified in the notice.

(3)
A person who fails to comply with an amenity notice served on them under
this section is guilty of an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine
of $50 000 and in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine of $1000 for
every day after the first say during which the failure to comply is continued.

Where a person on whom an amenity notice is served under this section
(4)
fails to comply with the notice, the Board may authorise the Chief Town Planner
to enter upon the land with such assistance as may be necessary and take such
measures or do such work as is necessary to effect compliance with the notice.

Any expenses incurred by the Chief Town Planner in respect of anything
(5)
done under subsection (4)  are a debt due to the Crown from the person on whom
the notice has been served, which the Crown may recover as a civil debt in a court
of competent jurisdiction.

Fixed Penalty Notices

62.(1)
Without prejudice to the rights of the Board to take any other steps
under this Act, where the owner or occupier of land commits an offence under
this Part, the Chief Town Planner may give that person a fixed penalty notice
charging that person with the commission of the offence and requiring them to
pay a fixed penalty for the offence within the time specified in the notice, or to
appear at the court of law specified in the notice on the date and time specified
therein to answer the offence charged.

A fixed penalty notice given under subsection (1) shall be in the prescribed

(2)
form, signed by the Chief Town Planner and specify

(a)

(b)

the name and address of the person liable for the alleged offence to
whom the notice is given;

the date, time and place at which the notice was given to the person
liable for the alleged offence;

81

(c)

the section of this Act creating the alleged offence and such particulars
of  the  offence  as  are  required  under  the  Magistrates  Court  Act,
Cap. 116A;

(d)

the date by which the fixed penalty is payable, which shall be 10 days
from the date of the notice;

(e)

the amount of the fixed penalty;

(f)

(g)

the clerk of the court to whom and the address at which or to which the
fixed penalty may be pain or remitted; and

the address of the Magistrates’ Court at which the person is required
to appear to answer the charge, in the event that the fixed penalty is not
paid within the specified time, and the date and time at which the person
is required to appear at the said court.

The Chief Town Planner shall send a duplicate copy of the fixed penalty
(3)
notice to the clerk of the court with jurisdiction over the area in which the offence
is alleged to have been committed and the said copy of the notice is deemed to
be a complaint within the meaning of the Magistrates’ Court Act, Cap. 116A.

Payment of the fixed penalty must be made to the clerk of the court having
(4)
jurisdiction over the area in which the offence is alleged to have been committed
within  the  time  specified  therein  and,  when  the  fixed  penalty  is  duly  paid  in
accordance with the notice, the person named in the notice is not liable to be
continued of the offence specified on the notice.

Notwithstanding any enactment to the contrary, the fixed penalty notice
(5)
given to the person is liable for the alleged offence is, from the expiration of the
time specified therein for payment of the fixed penalty, deemed to be a summons
issued in accordance with the Magistrates’ Court Act, Cap. 116A.

Where the fixed penalty is not paid within the time specified in the notice,
(6)
proceedings in respect of the offence specified in the notice shall proceed in the
manner specified in the Magistrates’ Court Act, Cap. 116A.

82

(7)
The  Minister  may  make  regulations  subject  to  negative  resolution,
providing  for  any  matter  incidental  to  the  operation  of  this  section,  and  in
particular for prescribing

(a)

the form of fixed penalty notice to be given by the Chief Town Planner;
and

(b)

the fixed penalty payable for each offence under this Part.

Appeals under this Part

Any person aggrieved by a decision of the Board made under this Part
63.(1)
may, within 28 days of the date of that decision, appeal against that decision to
the Tribunal in accordance with Part XI, setting out the grounds upon which the
appeal is made.

A person upon whom a notice under section 56(3) is served, or any other
(2)
person having a interest in the building, monument or site to which the notice
relates, may, at any time within the period specified in the notice at the end of
which it is to take effect, appeal to the Tribunal against the notice on any of the
following grounds

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

that the works to which the notice relates were not, or were not wholly,
works in contravention of the provisions of section 56(1);

that the works to which the notice relates were urgently necessary in
the interests of health and safety or for the preservation of the listed
building,  monument  or  site,  or  of  neighboring  property  and  an
application  has  been  made  to  the  Board  in  accordance  with  section
54(3);

that  the  requirements  of  the  notice  exceed  what  is  necessary  for
restoring  the  building,  monument  or  site  to  its  condition  before  the
works to which the notice relates were carried out;

that the period specified in the notice as the period within which any
steps  required  by  the  notice  to  be  taken  falls  short  of  what  should
reasonably be allowed; or

83

(e)

that any of the steps required by the notice to be taken would not serve
the purpose of restoring the character of the building, monument or site
to what it was before the works to which the notice relates were carried
out.

A person upon whom an amenity notice under section 61(1) is served, or
(3)
any other person having a interest in the building or land to which the notice
relates, may, at any time within the period specified in the notice at the end of
which it is to take effect, appeal to the Tribunal against the notice on either of the
following grounds

(a)

(b)

that  the  requirements  of  the  notice  exceed  what  is  necessary  for
remediating the condition of the building, monument or site to preserve
the amenity of the area; or

that the period specified in the notice as the period within which any
steps  required  by  the  notice  to  be  taken  falls  short  of  what  should
reasonably be allowed.

When an appeal is brought under this section, the decision or notice to
(4)
which it relates is of no effect pending the final determination or withdrawal of
the appeal.

PART VII

CONTROL OF OUTDOOR ADVERTISEMENTS

Advertisement Control Regulations

64.(1)
Subject to this section, the Minister may make regulations under this
Act for restricting or regulating the display of advertisements in the interest of
amenity  or  public  safety,  hereinafter  referred  to  as  “Advertisement  Control
Regulations”.

84

Without  restricting  the  generality  of  subsection  (1),  any  Advertisement

(2)
Control Regulations may provide for:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

regulating  the  dimensions,  materials  appearance  and  position  of
advertisements  that  may  be  displayed,  the  sites  on  which  the
advertisements may be displayed, and the manner in which they are to
be affixed to land;

requiring the consent of the Board to be obtained for the display of
advertisements,  or  of  advertisement  of  any  class  specified  in  the
regulations;

charging application and license fees with respect to the processing of
applications for such consent and for the display of advertisements of
different types;

for applying, in relation to any such consent and to applications for
such  consent,  any  of  the  provisions  of  Part  IV  relating  to  planning
permissions and to applications for such permission, subject to such
adaptations and modifications as may be specified in the regulations;
and

for enabling the Board to require the removal of any advertisement that
is  being  displayed  in  contravention  of  the  regulations,  or  the
discontinuance of the use for the display of advertisements of any site
that is being used for that purpose in contravention of the regulations,
and for that purpose for applying any of the provisions of Part VIII with
respect  to  enforcement  notices,  subject  to  such  adaptations  and
modifications as may be specified in the regulations.

Advertisement Control Regulations made under this Act may direct that
(3)
any Act, regulations or bylaws, affecting the display of advertisements in force
on the day when the regulations made under this Act come into operation, do not
apply to the display of advertisements in any area to which the Advertisement
Control Regulations made under this Act apply.

85

Existing outdoor advertisements

65.(1)
Advertisement  Control  Regulations  made  under  section  64  may  be
made so as to apply to advertisements that are being displayed on the date on
which  the  regulations  come  into  force,  or  to  the  use  for  the  display  of
advertisements of any site that was being used for that purpose on that date.

(2)

Regulations made under this section may make exceptions with respect to

(a)

(b)

the continued display of any such advertisement as is referred to in
subsection (1); and

the continued use for the display of advertisements of any such site as
is referred to in subsection (1), during such period as may be prescribed
by the regulations, and different periods may be so prescribed for the
purposes of different provisions of the regulations.

Special provisions for particular areas

Advertisement Control Regulations made under this Act may make
66.
different provisions with respect to different areas and in particular may make
special provision with respect to areas defined in the regulations as areas which
require special protection on the grounds of amenity.

Exercise of advertisement control powers

67.

In exercising the powers conferred on it by this Part the Board shall

(a)

in  the  interests  of  amenity,  determine  the  suitability  of  sites  for  the
display  of  advertisements  having  regard  to  any  development  plan
applicable to the area and to the general characteristics of the locality
including the presence of any feature of architectural, historic, cultural
or similar interest and the natural beauty or scenic value of the locality;
and

(b)

in the interests of public safety, determine the suitability of sites for the
display of advertisements having regard to the safety of persons who

86

may use any road, dock, harbour or airfield and in particular consider
whether any display of advertisements on the site is likely to hinder or
obscure any road or traffic sign or any aid to navigation by air or water.

Supplementary provisions as to advertisements

Where

the  display  of  advertisements

in  accordance  with
68.(1)
Advertisement Control Regulations involves the development of land within the
meaning of this Act permission for that development is deemed to be granted by
virtue of this section, and no application is necessary in that behalf under the
provisions of Part IV.

Without prejudice to any regulations made under section 104, any person
(2)
who  displays  an  advertisement  in  contravention  of  the  provisions  of  the
Advertisement Control Regulations is liable on summary conviction to a fine of
such amount as may be prescribed by the Advertisement Control Regulations,
not exceeding $50 000, and, in case of a continuing offence, to a further fine not
exceeding $1000 for every day after the first day during which the display is so
continued.

For the purposes of subsection (2) and without restricting the generality

(3)
thereof, a person is deemed to display an advertisement where

(a)

(b)

the advertisement is displayed on the land of which that person is the
owner or occupier; or

the advertisement gives publicity to the goods, trade, business or other
concerns of that person.

A person is not guilty of an offence under subsection (2) by reason only
(4)
that  an  advertisement  is  displayed  on  land  of  which  they  are  the  owner  or
occupier, or that their goods, trade, business or other concerns are given publicity
by  the  advertisement,  where  they  prove  that  it  was  displayed  without  their
knowledge or consent.

87

PART VIII

ENFORCEMENT

Power to serve an Enforcement Notice

The Board may, if it considers it expedient to do so having regard to
69.(1)
the provisions of the physical development plan for the area, if any, and to any
other  material  considerations,  serve  a  notice  (in  this  Act  referred  to  as  an
“enforcement notice”) under this section, if it appears to it that

(a)

(b)

any  development  of  land  has  been  carried  out  without  planning
permission required under Part IV; or

any  development  of  land  has  been  carried  out  in  breach  of  any
conditions  or  limitations  subject  to  which  planning  permission  is
granted  pursuant  to  section  32  or  section  33,  or  by  a  development
order made under section 23.

An enforcement notice shall be served within 4 years of the development
(2)
being carried out or, in the case of non-compliance of any condition or limitation,
within 4 years of the date of the alleged failure to comply.

(3)

An enforcement notice

(a)

(b)

(c)

shall be served on the owner and on the occupier of the land to which
it relates; and

may, if the Board thinks fit, be served on any other person having an
interest in that land which is materially affected by the notice; and

on any other person carrying on activities on the land which are alleged
to constitute a breach of the planning control, or causing such activities
to be carried on.

The fact that the Board fails to serve an enforcement notice on the persons
(4)
mentioned in subsection (3) does not invalidate any action or proceedings under
the notice against any other of those persons.

(5)

An enforcement notice

88

(a)

(b)

shall specify the development that is alleged to have been carried out
without planning permission, or the matters in respect of which it is
alleged that the development does not comply with the conditions or
limitations subject to which planning permission was granted, as the
case may be; and

may require such steps as are specified in the notice to be taken, within
a  specified  period,  for  restoring  the  land  to  its  condition  before  the
unauthorised development took place or for securing compliance with
the  conditions  or  limitations  subject  to  which  development  was
permitted, as the case may be, including but not limited to

(i)

(ii)

the discontinuation of any use of land or the carrying out of any
building, engineering, mining or other operations on the land; and

the demolition or alteration of any building, engineering, mining
or other works on the land.

Subject to this Part, an enforcement notice takes effect on the expiration
(6)
of 28 days from the date of service of the notice on either the owner or occupier
of the land.

Compliance  with  an  enforcement  notice  does  not  discharge  the

(7)
enforcement notice.

The Board may at any time revoke an enforcement notice without affecting
(8)
the power to serve another enforcement notice in respect of the same alleged
breach of the provisions of this Act.

Where an enforcement notice is revoked under subsection (8), the Board
(9)
shall serve notice of the revocation on every person on whom the enforcement
notice was served.

89

Application to retain unauthorised development

70.(1)
Where, before the enforcement notice takes effect, an application is
made to the Board in accordance with section 31 for the retention on land of any
buildings  or  works  or  the  continuance  of  any  use  of  the  land  to  which  the
enforcement notice relates, the operation of the enforcement notice is suspended
pending the determination of that application.

Where the Board grants planning permission for the retention on land of
(2)
buildings or other works or for the continuation of a use of land to which the
enforcement notice relates, the enforcement notice ceases to have effect in so far
as it requires steps to be taken for the demolition or alteration of those buildings
or works or the discontinuance of that use, as the case may be.

Where on an application made under this section the Board agrees to vary
(3)
some condition or limitation subject to which planning permission was granted,
the enforcement notices ceases to have effect in so far as it requires steps to be
taken to comply with that condition or limitation.

Stop notice

71.(1)
Where the Board has served an enforcement notice in respect of any
land,  the  Board  may,  at  any  time  before  the  enforcement  notice  takes  effect,
subject to any direction given by the Minister, serve a further notice (in this Act
referred to as a “stop notice”) prohibiting any person on whom the stop notice is
served from carrying out or continuing any building, engineering, mining or other
operations on the land, being activities either alleged in the enforcement notice
to constitute a breach of planning control or so closely associated therewith as to
constitute substantially the same development.

A stop notice served under subsection (1) shall contain a reference to, and
(2)
have annexed to it, a copy of the enforcement notice served in respect of the
unauthorised development of land to which the stop notice relates.

90

(3)
A stop notice may be served by the Board on any person who has an interest
in  the  land  or  appears  to  the  Board  to  be  concerned  with  the  carrying  out  or
continuance of any unauthorised operations thereon.

(4)

A stop notice

(a)

(b)

takes effect from the date of its service; and

without affecting subsection (5), ceases to have effect when

(i)

(ii)

the enforcement notice to which it relates is revoked by the Board
under section 69(8) or quashed by a court of law;

permission is granted for the retention of the building, works or
other operations in accordance with section 70;

(iii)

a person is convicted of an offence under section 74; or

(iv)

the Chief Town Planner enters on the land in accordance with
section 75.

The Board may at any time revoke a stop notice (without prejudice to their
(5)
power to serve another) by serving notice to that effect on the person on whom
the stop notice was served and the stop notice ceases to have effect as from the
date of withdrawal.

Where a stop notice is revoked under subsection (5), the Board shall serve

(6)
notice of the revocation on every person on whom the stop notice was served.

Where a stop notice takes effect in relation to works being carried out by
(7)
a person (hereinafter referred to as “the contractor”) under a contract with another
person  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  “the  developer”),  and  the  works  are
discontinued by the contractor in compliance with the notice, the developer is
under  the  same  liability  in  contract  as  if  the  operations  were  discontinued  on
instructions given to the contractor by the developer in breach of contract, unless
the contract explicitly provides to the contrary.

91

Appeals against Enforcement and Stop Notices

72.(1)
Before the enforcement notice takes effect, any person on whom the
notice is served who is aggrieved by the enforcement notice or, where a stop
notice has also been served, the stop notice, may lodge an appeal to a Judge in
chambers,  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  rules  of  court,  against  the
enforcement notice or the stop notice or both such notices on any of the following
grounds

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

(f)

that  what  is  assumed  in  the  enforcement  notice  to  constitute
development  did  not  constitute  or  involve  development  within  the
meaning of this Act;

that  planning  permission  has  been  granted  for  the  development  to
which the enforcement notice relates under Part IV;

that the development is of a class of permitted development specified
in a development order made under section 23;

that  the  development  complies  with  the  conditions  or  limitations
subject to which permission for the development was granted;

that the enforcement notice was not served within the period of 4 years
specified in section 69(2);

that  the  requirements  of  the  enforcement  notice  exceed  what  is
reasonably necessary for restoring the land to its condition before the
development in question took place or, as the case may be, for securing
compliance with the conditions or limitations to which the enforcement
notice relates;

(g)

that the period specified in the enforcement notice as the period within
which any steps are to be taken falls short of what should reasonably
be allowed;

92

(h)

that the enforcement notice or the stop notice, as the case may be, was
not served on the appellant in accordance with the provisions of section
97; or

(i)

that there are fundamental defects or errors in the enforcement notice
or the stop notice, as the case may be.

Where an appeal is made under this section, the enforcement notice is of

(2)
no effect pending the determination or withdrawal of the appeal.

On an appeal under this section, the Judge may correct any informality,
(3)
defect or error on the face of the enforcement notice, if the Judge is satisfied that
the informality, defect or error is not a material one and the correction is not
prejudicial to the appellant.

Where a stop notice has been served pursuant to section 71, the hearing of
(4)
an appeal against the stop notice or the enforcement notice related to the stop
notice is deemed to be a case for urgent hearing by the court.

On the determination of an appeal under this section, the Judge shall give
(5)
reasons for the court’s decision and directions for giving effect to that decision
including, where appropriate, directions or for varying the enforcement notice in
accordance with subsection (3) or for quashing the enforcement notice or stop
notice to which the appeal relates.

Where  an  enforcement  notice  is  varied  by  the  Judge  or  the  appeal  is
(6)
dismissed, the Judge may direct that the enforcement notice does not come into
force until such date as ordered by the court, not being less than 28 days from the
determination of the appeal.

On  the  determination  of  an  appeal  under  this  section,  the  Board  or  the
(7)
appellant may appeal to the Court of Appeal against the decision of the Judge in
chambers.

Compensation for loss due to stop notice

73.(1)
Where a stop notice ceases to have effect, a person who at the time
when it was first served had an interest in the land to which it relates is, in any

93

of the circumstances mentioned in subsection (2), entitled to be compensated by
the Crown in respect of any loss or specific damages directly attributable to the
prohibition contained in the notice.

(2)

A person is entitled to compensation under subsection (1) where

(a)

(b)

(c)

the enforcement notice to which the stop notice refers is quashed by a
court of law on any of the grounds specified in subsection 72(1);

an allegation in the enforcement notice upon which the prohibition in
the stop notice depends is not upheld because the enforcement notice
is varied in any material way on appeal to a Judge in chambers under
section 72;

the  enforcement  notice  is  revoked  by  the  Board,  otherwise  than  in
consequence of the grant or variation of a planning permission pursuant
to an application to retain the unauthorised development made under
section 70;

(d)

the stop notice is revoked by the Board under section 71(5).

A claim for compensation under this section shall be made to the Crown

(3)
within such time and in such manner as are prescribed by the Minister.

The loss or specific damages in respect of which compensation is payable
(4)
under this section includes a sum payable by any person for breach of contract
caused by the taking of action necessary to comply with prohibition in the stop
notice.

Compensation payable under this section shall, in default of agreement, be

(5)
determined by the procedure laid down in the Land Acquisition Act, Cap. 228.

Proceedings for non-compliance with notices

Where by virtue of an enforcement notice any building, engineering,
74.(1)
mining or other operations or any use of land is required to be discontinued, or
compliance is required with any conditions subject to which development was
permitted, any person who carries out, or causes or permits those operations to

94

be carried out or that use of land to continue, in contravention of the enforcement
notice, is guilty of an offence and is liable on summary conviction to

(a)

(b)

a fine of $100 000; and

a further fine of $10 000 a day for every day after the notice comes into
force during which the operations were carried on or the use of land
was continued in contravention of the enforcement notice.

Without prejudice to subsection (1), where an enforcement notice has been
(2)
served on a person who, at the time when the notice was served, was the owner
of the land to which the notice relates, then, if the steps specified in the notice to
be taken have not been taken within the time allowed for compliance with the
notice, that person is guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a
fine of $200 000.

Where a person on whom a stop notice is served carries out, or causes or
(3)
permits to be carried out any unauthorised building, engineering, mining or other
operations prohibited by the notice, that person is guilty of an offence and is liable
on summary conviction to:

(a)

(b)

a fine of $500 000; and

a further fine of $50 000 for each day after the notice was served during
which the prohibited operations continue.

Power to remove or alter works

75.(1)
Where a person on whom an enforcement notice was served fails or
refuses to take the steps required by the enforcement notice to remedy the breach
of planning control within the period specified in the enforcement notice, after
the  expiry  of  that  period,  the  Board  without  prejudice  to  their  right  to  take
summary proceedings for a fine in respect of the contravention of the enforcement
notice and the stop notice, may authorise the Chief Town Planner to enter the
land with such assistance as may be necessary and take those steps in respect of
the unauthorised development to enforce the notice as it may see fit.

When  the  Board  has  exercised  any  power  under  subsection  (1),  it  may
recover as a civil debt, from the person on whom the notice has been served, those
expenses reasonably incurred by it in the exercise of such power, in a court of
competent jurisdiction.

A person who is entitled to appeal against an enforcement notice under
(3)
section  72,  and  has  failed  to  make  such  an  appeal,  is  not  entitled  in  any
proceedings to dispute the validity of the action taken by the Board or the Chief
Town  Planner  upon  any  ground  that  could  have  been  entertained  on  such  an
appeal.

Without affecting the operation of section 74, a person who, without having
(4)
first obtained a planning permission, carries out any development on land by way
of reinstating or restoring buildings or other works that have been demolished or
altered  in  accordance  with  an  enforcement  notice,  pursuant  to  this  section,  is
guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine of $250 000.

Recovery of expenses

76.(1)
Any  expenses  incurred  by  the  owner  or  occupier  of  land  for  the
purpose of complying with an enforcement notice or stop notice served in respect
of  any  development,  or  paid  to  the  Board  pursuant  to  subsection  75(2),  are
deemed to be incurred or paid on behalf of and at the request of the person by
whom the development was carried out.

The Board may sell any materials which have been removed from any land,
(2)
including  any  street,  when  taking  steps  pursuant  to  section  75,  which  are  not
claimed  and  removed  by  the  owner  within  7  clear  days  of  the  date  of  their
removal.

Where the Board sells any materials pursuant to subsection (2), the amount
(3)
of money yielded by the sale shall be offset against the costs incurred by the
Board in any proceedings for debt recovery taken under section 75(2).

96

Injunctions

In addition to any other remedy provided by this Act, the Board may,
77.
in any case that it thinks fit, institute a civil action in the Supreme Court for an
injunction to prevent any person from violating the provisions of this Act, or to
enforce any enforcement notice or stop notice.

Saving of existing uses

78.
Nothing contained in this Part shall be construed as requiring planning
permission to be required for the use of land for the purpose for which it could
lawfully have been used if the development in respect of which an enforcement
notice is served had not been carried out.

Effect of Enforcement Notice on subsequent development

79.(1)
enforcement notice.

Compliance  with  an  enforcement  notice  does  not  discharge  the

(2)
Without  prejudice  to  subsection  (1),  any  provision  of  an  enforcement
notice requiring a use of land to be discontinued operates as a requirement that
it shall be discontinued permanently, to the extent that the use is in contravention
of Part IV and, accordingly, the resumption of that use at any time after it has
been discontinued in compliance with the enforcement notice is, to that extent,
in contravention of the enforcement notice.

Without prejudice to subsection (1), if any development is carried out on
(3)
land  by  way  of  reinstating  or  restoring  buildings  or  works  which  have  been
demolished  or  altered  in  compliance  with  an  enforcement  notice,  the  notice
(notwithstanding that its terms are not apt for the purpose) is deemed to apply in
relation to the buildings or works as reinstated or restored as it applied to the
buildings  or  works  before  they  were  demolished  or  altered  and,  subject  to
subsection (4), the provisions of section 75 and 76(1) apply accordingly.

Where  at  any  time  after  an  enforcement  notice  takes  effect,  the  Board
(4)
proposes to take any steps under section 75 with respect to any development is

97

carried by way of reinstating or restoring buildings or works which have been
demolished or altered in compliance with an enforcement notice, not less than
28  days  before  taking  any  such  steps,  the  Board  shall  serve  on  the  owner  or
occupier of the land a notice of their intention to take such steps.

Any person who, without the grant of planning permission, carries out any
(5)
development on land by way of reinstating or restoring buildings or works which
have been demolished or altered in compliance with an enforcement notice, is
guilty of an offence and is liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine of $250
000.

Exercise of the Board’s discretion to take enforcement action

The  Board  may  exercise  its  discretion  to  take  enforcement  action
80.(1)
under this Part on a complaint made by the Chief Town Planner or any other
person, but every such complaint shall be made to the Board through the Chief
Town Planner.

Every complaint concerning a breach of planning control made to the Chief
(2)
Town Planner by another person shall be recorded and the Chief Town Planner
shall inform the complainant in writing of the decision of the Board with respect
to the exercise of its discretion to take enforcement action in relation to their
complaint.

A document which discloses the identity of a complainant giving notice to
(3)
the Board of an alleged breach of planning control, or by means of which such a
person’s identity may be readily discovered, shall not be included in any register
or record to which members of the public have access.
