Period of responsibility of the carrier

Subject to subsections (2) and (3), the period of responsibility of the
22.(1)
carrier for goods under this Act begins when the carrier or a performing party
receives the goods for carriage and ends when the goods are delivered.

If the law of the place of receipt of goods requires the goods to be handed
(2)
over to an authority or other third party from which the carrier may collect them,
the  period  of  responsibility  of  the  carrier  begins  when  the  carrier  collects  the
goods from the authority or other third party.

If the law of the place of delivery of goods requires the carrier to hand over
(3)
the  goods  to  an  authority  or  other  third  party  from  which  the  consignee  may
collect them, the period of responsibility of the carrier ends when the carrier hands
the goods over to the authority or other third party.

33

(4)
For the purpose of determining the carrier’s period of responsibility, the
parties may agree on the time and location of receipt and delivery of the goods,
but  a  provision  in  a  contract  of  carriage  is  void  to  the  extent  that  it  provides
that

(a)

(b)

the time of receipt of the goods is subsequent to the beginning of their
initial loading under the contract of carriage; or

the time of delivery of the goods is prior to the completion of their final
unloading under the contract of carriage.

A  carrier  of  goods  shall,  during  the  period  of  its  responsibility
23.(1)
specified in section 22 and subject to section 36, properly and carefully receive,
load, handle, stow, carry, keep, care for, unload and deliver the goods.

Notwithstanding  subsection  (1),  and  without  prejudice  to  the  other
(2)
provisions in this Part and Parts V to VII, a carrier and a shipper may agree, by

and preservation.

34

Goods that may become a danger

Notwithstanding sections 16 and 18, a carrier or a performing party
25.
may decline to receive or load goods, and may take such other measures as are
reasonable, including unloading, destroying or rendering goods harmless, if the
goods are, or reasonably appear likely to become during the carrier’s period of
responsibility, a danger to persons, property or the environment.

Sacrifice of the goods during the voyage by sea

Notwithstanding sections 16, 18 and 19, a carrier or a performing party
26.
may sacrifice goods at sea when the sacrifice is reasonably made for the common
safety or for the purpose of preserving from peril human life or other property
involved in the common adventure.

of the carrier’s responsibility as defined in Part IV.

(2)

A carrier is relieved of all or part of its liability under subsection (1) if

(a)

(b)

if the claimant proves that the fault of the carrier or of a person referred
to in section 28 caused or contributed to the event or circumstance on
which the carrier relies; or

if  the  claimant  proves  that  an  event  or  circumstance  not  listed  in
subsection  (2)(b)  contributed  to  the  loss,  damage  or  delay,  and  the
carrier cannot prove that this event or circumstance is not attributable
to its fault or to the fault of any person referred to in section 28.

The carrier is also liable, notwithstanding subsection (2), for all or part of

(4)
the loss, damage, or delay if

(a)

the claimant proves that the loss, damage, or delay was or was probably
caused by or contributed to by

(i)

the unseaworthiness of the ship;

(i)

(ii)

none of the events or circumstances referred to in paragraph (a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

any other person who performed or undertook to perform, any of the
carrier’s obligations under the contract of carriage, to the extent that
the person acted, either directly or indirectly, at the carrier’s request or
under the carrier’s supervision or control.

Liability of maritime performing parties

29.(1)
A  maritime  performing  party  is  subject  to  the  obligations  and
liabilities  imposed  on  a  carrier  under  this  Act  and  is  entitled  to  the  carrier’s
defences and limits of liability as provided for in this Act, if

(a)

the maritime performing party received the goods for carriage in the
state  of  the  contracting  party,  delivered  them  in  the  state  of  the
contracting party, or performed its activities with respect to the goods
in a port in the state of a contracting party; and

(b)

the occurrence that caused the loss, damage or delay took place

(i)

during the period between the arrival of the goods at the port of
loading of the ship and their departure from the port of discharge
from the ship;

(ii)

while the maritime performing party had custody of the goods;
or

38

(iii)

at any other time the maritime performing party was participating
in the performance of any of the activities contemplated by the
contract of carriage.

(2)
If a carrier agrees to assume obligations other than those imposed on the
carrier under this Act, or agrees that the limits of its liability are higher than the
limits specified under this Act, a maritime performing party is not bound by that
agreement unless it expressly agrees to accept those obligations or higher limits.

A maritime performing party is liable for the breach of its obligations under
(3)
this Act caused by the acts or omissions of any person to whom it has entrusted
the performance of any of the carrier’s obligations under the contract of carriage
under the conditions set out in subsection (1).

Nothing in this Act imposes liability on the master or crew of a ship or on

(4)
an employee of a carrier or of a maritime performing party.

Joint and several liability

If a carrier and one or more maritime performing parties are liable for
30.(1)
the loss of, damage to or delay in delivery of goods, their liability is joint and

(2)
shall not exceed the overall limits of liability under this Act.

Delay

31.
destination provided for in the contract of carriage within the time agreed.

Delay in delivery occurs when goods are not delivered at the place of

Calculation of compensation

32.(1)
Subject to section 69 the compensation payable by a carrier for loss
of or damage to goods is calculated by reference to the value of the goods at the
place and time of delivery established in accordance with section 53.

(2)

The value of goods is fixed

39

(a)

(b)

(c)

according to the commodity exchange price;

if  there  is  no  commodity  exchange  price,  according  to  their  market
price; or,

if there is no commodity exchange price or market price, by reference
to the normal value of goods of the same kind and quality at the place
of delivery.

In case of loss of or damage to goods, the carrier is not liable for payment
(3)
of any compensation beyond what is provided for in section 32(1) and (2), except
when  the  carrier  and  the  shipper  have  agreed  to  calculate  compensation  in  a
different manner within the limits of Part XVI.

Notice in case of loss, damage or delay

A carrier is presumed, in absence of proof to the contrary, to have
33.(1)
delivered goods according to their description in the contract particulars, unless
notice of loss of or damage to the goods, indicating the general nature of the loss
or damage, was given to the carrier or the performing party that delivered the
goods before or at the time of the delivery or, if the loss or damage is not apparent,
within 7 working days after the delivery of the goods.

A failure to provide a notice referred to in subsection (1) to the carrier or
(2)
the performing party shall not affect the right to claim compensation for loss of
or damage to the goods under this Act or affect the allocation of the burden of
proof set out in section 27.

A notice referred to in subsection (1) is not required in respect of loss or
(3)
damage that is ascertained in a joint inspection of the goods by the person to
whom they have been delivered and the carrier or maritime performing party
against whom liability is being asserted.

No compensation in respect of delay is payable unless notice of the loss
(4)
due  to  the  delay  was  given  to  the  carrier  within  21  days  of  delivery  of  the
goods.

40

(5)
When a notice referred to in this section is given to a performing party who
delivered the goods, it has the same effect as if that notice was given to the carrier,
and a notice given to the carrier has the same effect as a notice given to a maritime
performing party.

In the case of any actual or apprehended loss or damage to goods, the parties
(6)
to the dispute shall give all reasonable facilities to each other for inspecting and
tallying the goods and shall provide access to records and documents relevant to
the carriage of the goods.

PART VI

PARTICULAR STAGES OF CARRIAGE

Deviation

When under the applicable law a deviation constitutes a breach of the
34.
carrier’s  obligations,  the  deviation  shall  not  deprive  the  carrier  or  a  maritime
performing party of any defence or limitation of this Act, except to the extent
provided in section 71.

Deck cargo on ships

35.(1)

Goods may be carried on the deck of a ship only if

(a)

(b)

the carriage is required by law;

they  are  carried  in  or  on  containers  or  vehicles  that  are  fit  for  deck
carriage, and the decks are specially fitted to carry such containers or
vehicles; or

(c)

the carriage on deck is in accordance with the contract of carriage, or
the customs, usages or practices of the trade in question.

The provisions of this Act relating to the liability of the carrier apply to the
(2)
loss of, damage to or delay in the delivery of goods carried on deck in accordance

41

with subsection (1), but the carrier is not liable for loss of or damage to the goods,
or for any delay in their delivery, caused by the special risks involved in their
carriage on deck in the circumstances referred to in paragraphs (1)(a) or (c).

If the goods have been carried on deck in a manner other than that permitted
(3)
under subsection (1), the carrier is liable for any loss of or damage to the goods
or any delay in their delivery that is exclusively caused by their carriage on deck,
and is not entitled to the defences provided for in section 27.

A carrier is not entitled to invoke paragraph (1)(c) against a third party that
(4)
has acquired a negotiable transport document or a negotiable electronic transport
record in good faith, unless the contract particulars state that the goods may be
carried on deck.

If a carrier and shipper expressly agreed that the goods would be carried
(5)
under deck, the carrier is not entitled to the benefit of the limitation of liability
for any loss of, damage to or delay in the delivery of the goods to the extent that
such loss, damage or delay resulted from their carriage on deck.

Carriage preceding or subsequent to sea carriage

36.
When loss of or damage to goods, or a circumstance causing a delay
in their delivery, occurs during the carrier’s period of responsibility but before
their loading onto the ship or after their discharge from the ship, the provisions
of this Act do not prevail over the provisions of another international instrument
that, at the time of the loss, damage or event or circumstance causing delay, if
the provisions of the international instrument

(a)

would have applied to all or any of the carrier’s activities if the shipper
had made a separate and direct contract with the carrier in respect of
the particular stage of carriage where the loss of, or damage to goods,
or an event or circumstance causing delay in their delivery occurred;

(b)

specifically provide for the carrier’s liability, limitation of liability or
time for suit; and

42

(c)

cannot be departed from by contract either at all or to the detriment of
the shipper under that instrument.

PART VII

OBLIGATIONS OF THE SHIPPER TO THE CARRIER

Delivery for carriage

37.(1)

A shipper shall deliver goods in such a condition that

(a)

they  will  withstand  the  intended  carriage,  including  their  loading,
handling, stowing, lashing, securing and unloading; and

(b)

they will not cause harm to persons or property.

Unless otherwise agreed in the contract of carriage, a shipper shall deliver

(2)
goods ready for carriage.

A  shipper  shall  properly  and  carefully  perform  any  obligation  assumed

(3)
under an agreement made under section 23(2).

When a container is packed or a vehicle is loaded by a shipper, the shipper
(4)
shall  properly  and  carefully  stow,  lash  and  secure  the  contents  in  or  on  the
container or vehicle in such a way that they will not cause harm to persons or
property.

Cooperation in providing information and instructions

38.
A carrier and a shipper shall respond to requests from each other to
provide  information  and  instructions  required  for  the  proper  handling  and
carriage of goods, if the information is in the requested party’s possession or the
instructions are within the requested party’s reasonable ability to provide and
they are not otherwise reasonably available to the requesting party.

43

Shipper’s obligation to provide information, instructions and
documents

39.(1)
A  shipper  shall  provide  to  the  carrier  in  a  timely  manner  any
information,  instructions  and  documents  relating  to  the  goods  that  are  not
otherwise reasonably available to the carrier, and that are necessary

(a)

(b)

for the proper handling and carriage of the goods, including precautions
to be taken by the carrier or a performing party; and

for the carrier to comply with laws, regulations or other requirements
of public authorities in connection with the intended carriage,

if  the  carrier  notifies  the  shipper  in  a  timely  manner  of  the  information,
instructions and documents it requires.

Nothing  in  this  Part  affects  any  obligation  to  provide  information,
(2)
instructions or documents related to goods pursuant to a law, regulations or other
requirements of public authorities in connection with the intended carriage.

Basis of shipper’s liability to carrier

40.(1)
A shipper is liable for loss or damage sustained by the carrier, if the
carrier proves that the loss or damage was caused by a breach of the shipper’s
obligations under this Act.

Except in respect of loss or damage caused by a breach by the shipper of
(2)
its obligations pursuant to section 40(2) and section 42, a shipper is relieved of
all or part of its liability if the cause, or one of the causes, of the loss or damage
is not attributable to its fault or to the fault of any person referred to in section
44.

When  a  shipper  is  relieved  of  part  of  its  liability  under  this  section  the
(3)
shipper is liable only for that part of the loss or damage that is attributable to its
fault or to the fault of a person referred to in section 44.

44

Information for compilation of contract particulars

41.(1)
A shipper shall provide to the carrier, in a timely manner, accurate
information  required  for  the  compilation  of  the  contract  particulars  and  the
issuance of the transport documents or electronic transport records, including

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

the particulars referred to in section 46(1);

the name of the party to be identified as the shipper in the contract;

the name of the consignee, if any; and

the  name  of  any  person  to  whose  order  the  transport  document  or
electronic transport record is to be issued.

A shipper is deemed to have guaranteed the accuracy, at the time of receipt
(2)
by the carrier, of the information that is provided under subsection (1), and shall
indemnify the carrier against loss or damage resulting from the inaccuracy of that
information.

Special rules on dangerous goods

When  goods  by  their  nature  are,  or  reasonably  appear  likely  to
42.(1)
become,  a  danger  to  persons,  property  or  the  environment,  the  shipper  shall
inform the carrier of the dangerous nature of the goods in a timely manner before
they are delivered to the carrier or a performing party.

If the shipper fails to do so and the carrier or performing party does not
(2)
otherwise have knowledge of the dangerous nature of the goods, the shipper is
liable to the carrier for loss or damage resulting from the failure.

A shipper shall mark or label dangerous goods in accordance with any laws,
(3)
regulations or other requirements of public authorities that apply during any stage
of the intended carriage of the goods.

If the shipper fails to do so, it is liable to the carrier for loss or damage

(4)
resulting from the failure.

45

Assumption of shipper’s rights and obligations by a documentary
shipper

43.(1)
A  documentary  shipper  is  subject  to  the  obligations  and  liabilities
imposed on the shipper under this Part and under section 65, and is entitled to
the shipper’s rights and defences provided by this Part and by Part XIII.

Subsection (1) does not affect the obligations, liabilities, rights or defences

(2)
of the shipper.

Liability of the shipper for other persons

A  shipper  is  liable  for  the  breach  of  its  obligations  under  this  Act
44.
caused by the acts or omissions of any person, including employees, agents and
sub-contractors,  to  whom  it  has  entrusted  the  performance  of  any  of  its
obligations, but the shipper is not liable for the acts or omissions of a carrier, or
of  a  performing  party  acting  on  behalf  of  a  carrier,  to  which  the  shipper  has
entrusted the performance of its obligations.

PART VIII

TRANSPORT DOCUMENTS AND ELECTRONIC TRANSPORT RECORDS

Issuance of a transport document or electronic transport record

Unless  a  shipper  and  a  carrier  have  agreed  not  to  use  a  transport
45.
document or an electronic transport record, or it is the custom, usage or practice
of the trade not to use one, upon delivery of the goods for carriage to the carrier
or  performing  party,  the  shipper  or,  if  the  shipper  consents,  the  documentary
shipper, is entitled to obtain from the carrier, at the shipper’s option

(a)

a non-negotiable transport document or, subject to section 18(a), a non-
negotiable electronic transport record; or

46

(b)

an  appropriate  negotiable  transport  document  or,  subject  to  section
18(a), a negotiable electronic transport record, unless the shipper and
the carrier have agreed not to use a negotiable transport document or
negotiable  electronic  transport  record,  or  it  is  the  custom,  usage  or
practice of the trade not to use one.

Contract particulars

46.(1)
The  contract  particulars  in  the  transport  document  or  electronic
transport record referred to in section 45 shall include the following information,
as furnished by the shipper:

(a)

(b)

(c)

a description of the goods appropriate for the transport;

the leading marks necessary for identification of the goods;

the number of packages or pieces, or the quantity of goods; and

(d)

the weight of the goods, if furnished by the shipper.

The contract particulars in the transport document or electronic transport

(2)
record referred to in section 45 shall also include

(a)

a statement of the apparent order and condition of the goods at the time
the carrier or a performing party receives them for carriage;

(b)

the name and address of the carrier;

(c)

the date on which the carrier or a performing party received the goods,
on which the goods were loaded on board the ship, or on which the
transport document or electronic transport record was issued;

(d)

if the transport document is negotiable and more than one original is
issued, the number of originals of the negotiable transport document;

(e)

the name and address of the consignee, if named by the shipper;

(f)

the name of a ship, if specified in the contract of carriage;

(g)

the place of receipt and, if known to the carrier, the place of delivery;

47

(h)

(i)

the port of loading and the port of discharge, if specified in the contract
of carriage;

the  intended  journey  route,  modes  of  transport  and  places  of
transshipment, if known;

(j)

any other particulars which the parties have agreed to.

(3)

For the purposes of subsection (2)(a),

“apparent order and condition of the goods” means the order and condition of the

goods based on

(a)

(b)

a reasonable external inspection of the goods, as packaged at the time
the shipper delivers them to the carrier or a performing party; and

any  additional  inspection  that  the  carrier  or  a  performing  party
performs before issuing the transport document or electronic transport
record.

Identity of the carrier

47.(1)
If a carrier is identified by name in a contract, any other information
in the transport document or electronic transport record relating to the identity of
the  carrier  shall  have  no  effect  to  the  extent  that  it  is  inconsistent  with  that
identification.

If  no  person  is  identified  in  a  contract  as  the  carrier,  as  required  under
(2)
section 46(2)(b), but the contract particulars indicate that the goods have been
loaded on board a named ship, the registered owner of that ship is presumed to
be the carrier, unless it proves that the ship was under a bareboat charter at the
time  of  the  carriage  and  it  identifies  the  bareboat  charterer  and  indicates  its
address, in which case the bareboat charterer is presumed to be the carrier.

A  registered  owner  may  rebut  the  presumption  of  being  the  carrier  by
(3)
identifying the carrier and indicating its address, and a bareboat charterer may
rebut a presumption of being the carrier in the same manner.

48

(4)
Nothing in this section prevents a claimant from proving that a person other
than a person identified in the contract particulars or under subsection (2) or (3)
is the carrier.

Signature

Deficiencies in the contract particulars

The absence or inaccuracy of a contract particular referred to in section
49.(1)
46 does not affect the legal character or validity of the transport document or of

(2)
date is deemed to be

(a)

(b)

if the contract particulars indicate that the goods have been loaded on

or

if  the  contract  particulars  do  not  indicate  that  the  goods  have  been

(a)

(b)

the carrier had no physically practicable or commercially reasonable
means of checking the information furnished by the shipper, in which
case it may indicate which information it was unable to check; or

the carrier has reasonable grounds to believe the information furnished
by the shipper to be inaccurate, in which case it may include a clause
providing what it reasonably considers to be accurate information.

When goods are delivered for carriage to a carrier or a performing party in

(4)
a closed container or vehicle

(a)

the  carrier  may  qualify  the  information  referred  to  in  section  46(1)

by the carrier or a performing party; and

50

(ii)

neither the carrier nor a performing party otherwise has knowledge
of  its  contents  before  issuing  the  transport  document  or  the

51.
the circumstances and in the manner set out in section 50

a  negotiable  transport  document  or  a  negotiable  electronic
transport record that is transferred to a third party acting in good
faith; or

a non-negotiable transport document that indicates that it shall be
surrendered in order to obtain delivery of the goods and that is
transferred to the consignee acting in good faith; and

(c)

proof to the contrary by the carrier shall not be admissible against a
consignee  who  in  good  faith  has  acted  in  reliance  on  any  of  the

51

following contract particulars included in a non-negotiable transport
document or a non-negotiable electronic transport record:

(i)

(ii)

transport record has been issued

When  a  negotiable  transport  document  or  a  negotiable  electronic

(a)

the holder of the negotiable transport document or negotiable electronic
transport  record  is  entitled  to  claim  delivery  of  the  goods  from  the
carrier after they have arrived at the place of destination, in which event
the carrier shall deliver the goods to the holder at the time and location
referred to in section 53.

(i)

upon surrender of the negotiable transport document and, if the
holder  is  the  shipper,  the  consignee  or  a  person  to  whom  the
document was duly endorsed, upon the holder providing proper
identification; or

55

(ii)

upon  demonstration  by  the  holder,  in  accordance  with  the
procedures referred to in section 19(1), that it is the holder of the
negotiable electronic transport record;

(b)

(c)

(d)

the carrier shall refuse delivery if the requirements of paragraph (a)(i)
or (ii) are not met;

if more than one original of the negotiable transport document has been
issued,  and  the  number  of  originals  is  stated  in  that  document,  the
surrender of one original will suffice and the other originals cease to
have any effect or validity; and

when a negotiable electronic transport record has been used, the record
ceases  to  have  any  effect  or  validity  upon  delivery  to  the  holder  in
accordance with the procedures required by section 19(1).

Without prejudice to section 58(1), if a negotiable transport document or
(2)
the  negotiable  electronic  transport  record  expressly  states  that  goods  may  be
delivered  without  the  surrender  of  the  transport  document  or  the  electronic
transport record, the following rules apply:

(a)

if the goods are not deliverable because

(i)

(ii)

the holder, after having received a notice of arrival, does not, at
the time or within the time period referred to in section 48, claim
delivery of the goods from the carrier after their arrival at the
place of destination;

the carrier refuses delivery because the person claiming to be a
holder  does  not  properly  identify  himself  as  the  shipper,  the

or

(iii)

in order to request delivery instructions,

the carrier may so advise the shipper and request instructions in respect of the
delivery of the goods or, if after a reasonable effort the carrier is unable to locate

56

the  shipper,  the  carrier  may  so  advise  the  documentary  shipper  and  request

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

a  carrier  that  delivers  goods  upon  instruction  of  the  shipper  or  the
documentary shipper in accordance with paragraph (a) is discharged
from its obligation to deliver the goods under the contract of carriage
to the holder, irrespective of whether the negotiable transport document
has  been  surrendered  to  it  or  the  person  claiming  delivery  under  a
negotiable electronic transport record has demonstrated, in accordance
with the procedures referred to in section 19(1), that he is the holder;

the person giving instructions under subsection (2)(a) shall indemnify
the  carrier  against  any  loss  arising  from  its  being  held  liable  to  the
holder  under  subsection  (2)(e)  and  the  carrier  may  refuse  to  follow
those instructions if the person fails to provide such adequate security
as the carrier may reasonably request;

a person who becomes a holder of the negotiable transport document
or  the  negotiable  electronic  transport  record  after  the  carrier  has
delivered  the  goods  pursuant  to  contractual  or  other  arrangements
acquires rights against the carrier under the contract of carriage, other
than the right to claim delivery of the goods, if the contractual or other
arrangements were made prior to the delivery of the goods; and

notwithstanding paragraphs (b) and (d), a holder that becomes a holder
after  delivery  of  the  goods,  and  who  did  not  have,  and  could  not
reasonably have had, knowledge of the delivery at the time of becoming
a holder, acquires the rights incorporated in the negotiable transport
document or negotiable electronic transport record.

For the purpose of subsection (2)(e), when a contract states the expected
(3)
time of arrival of goods, or indicates how to obtain information as to whether the
goods have been delivered, it is presumed that the holder at the time of becoming
a holder had, or could reasonably have had, knowledge of the delivery of the
goods.

57

55, 56 or 57;

the carrier is not allowed to deliver the goods to the consignee under
the laws of the place at which delivery is requested; or

the goods are otherwise undeliverable by the carrier.

Without  prejudice  to  any  other  rights  that  a  carrier  may  have  against  a
(2)
shipper, controlling party or consignee, if goods remain undelivered, the carrier
may, at the risk and expense of the person entitled to the goods, take such action
in respect of the goods as circumstances may reasonably require, including

(a)

(b)

(c)

storing the goods at any suitable place;

unpacking or moving the goods; or

(3)
reasonable notice of the intended action under that subsection to

the person stated in the contract as the person, if any, to be notified of
the arrival of the goods at the place of destination; and

the  consignee,  the  controlling  party  or  the  shipper,  if  known  to  the
carrier, in that order.

58

(4)
If goods are sold under subsection (2)(c), the carrier shall hold the proceeds
of the sale for the benefit of the person entitled to the goods, but may deduct any
costs incurred by the carrier and any other amounts that are due to the carrier in
connection with the carriage of those goods.

A carrier shall not be liable for loss of or damage to goods that occurs
(5)
during  the  time  that  they  remain  undelivered  under  this  section,  unless  the
claimant proves that the loss or damage resulted from a failure by the carrier to
take steps that would have been reasonable in the circumstances to preserve the
goods and that the carrier knew, or ought to have known, that the loss or damage
to the goods would result from its failure to take such steps.

Retention of goods

Nothing in this Act affects a right of the carrier or a performing party
59.
that may exist, pursuant to the contract of carriage or the applicable law, to retain
the goods to secure the payment of sums due.

in the contract particulars, or when a higher limitation of liability has been agreed
upon between the carrier and the shipper.

When goods are carried in or on a container, pallet or similar article of
(2)
transport used to consolidate goods, or in or on a vehicle, the packages or shipping
units  enumerated  in  the  contract  particulars  as  packed  in  or  on  that  article  of

(4)
currency of a state according to the value of the currency at the date of judgement
or award or the date agreed upon by the parties.

65

(5)
In determining a special drawing right, the value of a national currency of
a contracting party that is a member of the International Monetary Fund is to be
calculated  in  accordance  with  the  method  of  valuation  applied  by  the
International Monetary Fund for its operations and transactions in effect at the
date in question.

In determining a special drawing right, the value of a national currency of
(6)
a contracting party that is not a member of the International Monetary Fund is to
be calculated in a manner to be determined by that party.

(7)

In this section,

“unit  of  account”  means  a  special  drawing  right  defined  by  the  International

Monetary Fund.

exceed the limit established under section 69(1) in respect of the total loss of the
goods.

Loss of the benefit of limitation of liability

71.(1)
Neither the carrier nor a person referred to in section 28 is entitled to
the benefit of the limitation of liability provided in section 69, or as provided in
the contract of carriage, if the claimant proves that the loss resulting from the
breach of the carrier’s obligation under this Act was attributable to a personal act
or omission of the person claiming the benefit that was done with the intent to
cause the loss or was done recklessly and with knowledge that the loss would
probably result.

66

(2)
Neither the carrier nor a person referred to in section 28 is entitled to the
benefit of the limitation of liability provided in section 70 if the claimant proves
that the delay in delivery resulted from a personal act or omission of the person
claiming the benefit that was done with the intent to cause the loss due to delay
or that was done recklessly and with knowledge that the loss would probably
result.

PART XIII

TIME FOR SUIT

expiration of a period of 2 years after the day on which the carrier delivered the
goods or, where no goods were delivered or only part of the goods were delivered,
on the last day on which the goods should have been delivered.

claim asserted by the other party.

Extension of time for suit

73.(1)
The period provided in section 72 shall not be subject to suspension
or interruption, but the person against whom a claim is made may at any time
during  the  running  of  the  period  extend,  or  further  extend,  that  period  by  a
declaration to the claimant.

A  declaration  under  subsection  (1)  is  deemed  to  be  given  where  an
(2)
unequivocal  statement  is  made  or  published  in  a  written  form,  including  in
electronic or digital form or by facsimile, by the party against which the claimant
was entitled to access the goods or obtain them by lawful means.

the time allowed by the applicable law in the jurisdiction where the
proceedings are instituted; and

indemnity has either settled the claim or been served with process in
the action against itself, whichever is earlier.

Actions against the person identified as the carrier

(b)

the  time  allowed  by  the  applicable  law  in  the  jurisdiction  where
proceedings are instituted; and

90 days after the day when the carrier was identified, or the registered
owner  or  bareboat  charterer  rebutted  the  presumption  that  it  is  the
carrier, under section 47(2).

A court in a state in which a provisional or protective measure was taken

(2)
does not have jurisdiction to determine the case upon its merits unless

(d)

any other regionally or internationally transport rules in force,

PART XV

ARBITRATION

Arbitration agreements

84.(1)
Subject to this Part and notwithstanding Part XIV, parties may agree
that any dispute that may arise relating to the carriage of goods under this Act
shall be referred to arbitration.

72

Arbitration proceedings shall, at the option of the person asserting a claim

(2)
against the carrier, take place at

(a)

(b)

a place designated for that purpose in the arbitration agreement; or

any  other  place  situated  in  a  state  in  which  any  of  the  following  is
located:

(i)

the domicile of the carrier;

(ii)

the place of receipt agreed in the contract of carriage;

(iii)

the place of delivery agreed in the contract of carriage;

(iv)

the port where the goods are initially loaded on a ship; or

(v)

the port where the goods are finally discharged from a ship.

The designation of the place of arbitration in an agreement is binding for
(3)
disputes between the parties to the agreement, if the agreement is contained in a
volume contract that clearly states the names and addresses of the parties and

(a)

(b)

is individually negotiated; or

contains a prominent statement that there is an arbitration agreement
and  specifies  the  sections  of  the  volume  contract  containing  the
arbitration agreement.

When  an  arbitration  agreement  has  been  concluded  in  accordance  with
(4)
subsection (3), a person who is not a party to the volume contract is bound by the
designation of the place of arbitration in that agreement only if

(a)

(b)

(c)

the place of arbitration designated in the agreement is situated in one
of the places referred to in subsection (2)(b);

the  agreement  is  contained  in  the  transport  document  or  electronic
transport record;

the person to be bound is given timely and adequate notice of the place
of arbitration; and

73

(d)

applicable  law  permits  that  person  to  be  bound  by  the  arbitration
agreement.

(5)
Subsections (1) to (4) are deemed to be part of every arbitration clause or
agreement, and any term of a clause or agreement that is inconsistent with them
is void to the extent of the inconsistency.

Where the parties in a dispute subject to an arbitration clause are members
(6)
of  the  Shipping  Association  of  Barbados  or  another  Barbados-based  private
sector  shipping  organization,  the  parties  have  been  unable  to  agree  on  an
arbitrator and the arbitration clause or agreement does not otherwise provide for
the  selection  or  appointment  of  the  arbitrator,  either  party  may  request  the
Shipping Association of Barbados or other private sector shipping organization
to  appoint  an  arbitrator,  and  any  arbitrator  so  selected  shall  be  taken  as  the
arbitrator for the dispute between the parties.

Arbitration agreement in non-liner transportation

Nothing  in  this  Act  affects  the  enforceability  of  an  arbitration
85.(1)
agreement in a contract of carriage in non-liner transportation to which this Act
applies by reason of

(a)

(b)

the application of section 12; or

the parties’ voluntary incorporation of the provisions of this Act in a
contract of carriage that would not otherwise be subject to this Act.

Notwithstanding  subsection  (1),  an  arbitration  agreement  in  a  transport
(2)
document or electronic transport record to which this Act applies by reason of
the application of section 12 is subject to this Part, unless the transport document
or electronic transport record

(a)

identifies  the  parties  to,  and  the  date  of,  the  charter  party  or  other
contract  excluded  from  the  application  of  this  Act  by  reason  of  the
application of section 11; and

(b)

incorporates  by  reference  the  clause  in  the  charter  party  or  other
contract that contains the terms of the arbitration agreement.

74

Agreement to arbitrate after a dispute has arisen

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  this  Part  and  Part  XIV,  after  a
86.
dispute has arisen, the parties to the dispute may agree to resolve it by arbitration
in any place.

PART XVI

VALIDITY OF CONTRACTUAL TERMS

General provisions

87.(1)
is void to the extent that it

Unless otherwise provided in this Act, a term in a contract of carriage

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

directly or indirectly excludes or limits the obligations of the carrier or
a maritime performing party under this Act;

directly or indirectly excludes or limits the liability of the carrier or a
maritime performing party for breach of an obligation under this Act;

assigns a benefit of insurance of goods in favour of the carrier or a
person referred to in section 28;

directly or indirectly excludes, limits or increases the obligations under
this  Act  of  the  shipper,  consignee,  controlling  party,  holder  or
documentary shipper; or

directly or indirectly excludes, limits or increases the liability of the
shipper, consignee, controlling party, holder or documentary shipper
for breach of any of its obligations under this Act.

75

Special rules for volume contracts

88.(1)
Notwithstanding  section  87,  a  volume  contract  to  which  this  Act
applies  may  provide  for  greater  or  lesser  rights,  obligations  and  liabilities  as
between the carrier and the shipper than those imposed by this Act.

(2)

This section applies only when

(a)

the volume contract contains a prominent statement that it derogates
from this Act;

(b)

the volume contract is

(i)

individually negotiated; or

(ii)

prominently  specifies  the  sections  of  the  volume  contract
containing the derogations;

(c)

the shipper is given an opportunity, and notice of the opportunity, to
conclude a contract of carriage on terms and conditions that comply
with this Act without any derogation under subsection (1); and

(d)

the derogation is neither

(i)

incorporated by reference from another document; nor

(ii)

included in a contract of adhesion that is not subject to negotiation.

A  carrier’s  public  schedule  of  prices  and  services,  transport  document,
(3)
electronic transport record or similar document is not a volume contract under
section  86(1),  but  a  volume  contract  may  incorporate  such  documents  by
reference as terms of the contract.

Section 86(1) does not apply to rights and obligations provided in section
(4)
24(a)  or  (b),  section  39  or  42,  or  to  liability  arising  from  their  breach  or  any
liability arising from an act or omission referred to in section 71.

76

(5)
The terms of a volume contract that derogate from this Act, if the volume
contract satisfies the requirements of subsection (2), apply between the carrier
and any person other than the shipper if

(a)

the person received information that prominently states that the volume
contract derogates from this Act and gave his express consent to be
bound by the derogations; and

(b)

the consent is not solely set forth in the carrier’s public schedule of
prices and services, transport document or electronic transport record.

A party claiming the benefit of a derogation bears the burden of proof that

(6)
the conditions for derogation have been fulfilled.

Special rules for live animals and certain other goods

Notwithstanding  section  87  and  without  prejudice  to  section  88,  a
89.(1)
contract of carriage may exclude or limit the obligations or the liability of both
the carrier and a maritime performing party if

(a)

(b)

the goods are live animals; or

the character or condition of the goods, or the circumstances and terms
and conditions under which the carriage is to be performed, reasonably
justify a special agreement, if the contract of carriage is not related to
ordinary commercial shipments made in the ordinary course of trade
and  no  negotiable  transport  document  or  negotiable  electronic
transport record is issued for the carriage of the goods.

Any such exclusion or limitation in relation to live animals will not be
(2)
effective if the claimant proves that the loss of or damage to the goods, or delay
in delivery, resulted from an act or omission of the carrier or of a person referred
to in section 28

(a)

done with the intent to cause the loss of or damage to the goods or a
loss due to delay; or

77

(b)

done recklessly and with knowledge that such a loss or damage would
probably result.

PART XVII

MATTERS NOT GOVERNED BY THE ACT

Nothing  in  this  Act  affects  the  application  of  any  international
90.

damage as either the Paris or Vienna Conventions or the Convention
on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage.

PART XVIII

CARRIAGE OF GOODS BEYOND THE SEA: BY ROAD

Application - Part XVIII

94.(1)
The provisions of this Act specific to the carriage of goods by road
shall apply to every contract for the carriage of goods by road in vehicles for
reward, when the place of taking over of the goods and the place designated for
delivery, as specified in the contract, are situated in two different countries, of
which at least one is a contracting country, irrespective of the place of residence
and the nationality of the parties, and includes carriage carried out by states or
by governmental institutions or organizations.

(2)

This Part shall not apply to

(a)

carriage  performed  under  the  terms  of  an  international  postal
convention;

79

(b)

funeral consignments; or

(c)

furniture removal.

Definitions - Part XVIII

95.

For the purposes of this Part,

“consignment note” means a document regarding the carriage of goods by road
that declares the contract of carriage, includes the instructions given to the
carrier and proves the contract of carriage;

“successive carrier” means a carrier

(a)

that is subject to a single contract, entered into between the principal
carrier and the shipper; and

(b)

that has accepted goods and a consignment note; and

“vehicle” means a motor vehicle, articulated vehicle, trailer or semi-trailer as

defined in Article 4 or the Convention on Road Traffic, 1949.

Vehicles containing goods

96.(1)
Subject to subsection (2) and section 108, where a vehicle containing
goods is carried over part of the journey by sea, rail, inland waterways or air and
the goods are not unloaded from the vehicle, this Act shall apply to the whole of
the carriage.

If it is proved that any loss, damage or delay in delivery of the goods that
(2)
occurs during the carriage by a means of transport other than road was not caused
by an act or omission of the carrier by road, but by some event that could have
occurred only in the course of and by reason of the carriage by that other means
of transport, the liability of the carrier by road shall be determined not by this
Act but in the manner in which the liability of the carrier by the other means of
transport would have been determined if a contract for the carriage of the goods
had been made by the sender with the carrier by the other means of transport

80

alone in accordance with the conditions prescribed by law for the carriage of
goods by that means of transport.

If, however, there are no such prescribed conditions, the liability of the

(3)
carrier by road shall be determined by this Act.

If the carrier by road is also the carrier by the other means of transport,
(4)
liability shall be determined in accordance with subsections (1) to (3), but as if,
in its capacities as carrier by road and as carrier by the other means of transport,
it were two separate entities.

Persons for whom the Carrier is Responsible

Persons for whom the Carrier is Responsible Carrier’s responsibility

A carrier is responsible for the acts and omissions of its agents and
97.
servants  and  of  any  other  persons  of  whose  services  it  makes  use  for  the
performance of the carriage, when those agents, servants or other persons are
acting within the scope of their employment, as if such acts or omissions were
the carrier’s own.

On taking over goods, the carrier shall check

(a)

the accuracy of the statements in the consignment note as to the number
of packages and their marks and numbers; and

(b)

the apparent condition of the goods and their packaging.

Where a carrier has no reasonable means of checking the accuracy of the
(2)
statements referred to in paragraph (1)(a), it shall enter its reservations in the
consignment note together with the grounds on which they are based and specify
the  grounds  for  any  reservations  with  regard  to  the  apparent  condition  of  the
goods and their packaging.

Such reservations shall not bind the sender unless the sender has expressly

(3)
agreed to be bound by them in the consignment note.

The sender may require the carrier to check the gross weight of the goods
(4)
or  their  quantity  otherwise  expressed,  and  may  require  the  contents  of  the

(2)
presumed that the goods and their packaging appeared to be in good condition
when the carrier took them over and that the number of packages, their marks
and numbers corresponded with the statements in the consignment note.

84

Liability of the sender

The  sender  of  goods  is  liable  to  the  carrier  for  damage  to  persons,
104.
equipment or other goods, and for any expenses due to defective packing of the
goods, unless the defect was apparent or known to the carrier at the time when it
took over the goods and it made no reservations concerning it.

Sender’s requirements in the delivery of goods

105.(1)
For  the  purposes  of  customs  or  other  formalities  to  be  completed
before delivery of the goods, the sender shall attach the necessary documents to
the consignment note or place them at the disposal of the carrier and shall furnish
it with all the information that it requires.

The carrier shall not be under any duty to enquire into the accuracy or the

(2)
adequacy of such documents and information.

The sender is liable to the carrier for any damage caused by the absence,
(3)
inadequacy or irregularity of such documents and information that is not caused
by a wrongful act or neglect on the part of the carrier.

The liability of the carrier for consequences arising from a loss, inadequacy
(4)
or irregularity of the documents accompanying the consignment note or deposited
with the carrier shall be that of an agent.

Compensation payable by the carrier under subsection (4) shall not exceed

(5)
that payable in the event of loss of the goods.

Sender’s and consignee’s rights of disposal of goods

106.(1)

A sender has the right to

(a)

dispose of goods, including by asking the carrier to stop the goods in
transit;

(b)

change the place at which delivery is to take place; or

85

(c)

deliver the goods to a consignee other than the consignee indicated in
the consignment note.

(2)
A right of the sender under subsection (1) shall cease to exist when the
second  copy  of  the  consignment  note  is  handed  to  a  consignee  or  when  a
consignee exercises a right under section 107(1), from which time onwards the
carrier shall obey the orders of the consignee.

A consignee shall, however, have a right of disposal from the time when
(3)
the consignment note is drawn up, if the sender makes an entry to that effect in
the consignment note.

If, in exercising a right of disposal, a consignee has ordered the delivery
(4)
of the goods to another person, that other person shall not be entitled to name
other consignees.

(5)

A right of disposal may be exercised if

(a)

(b)

the  sender  or,  in  the  circumstances  referred  to  in  subsection  (3),  a
consignee who wishes to exercise the right produces the first copy of
the consignment note on which the new instructions to the carrier have
been entered and indemnifies the carrier against all expenses, loss and
damage involved in carrying out such instructions;

the carrying out of such instructions is possible at the time when the
instructions reach the person who is to carry them out and does not
interfere  with  the  normal  working  of  the  carrier's  undertaking  or
prejudice the senders or consignees of other consignments; and

(c)

the instructions do not result in a division of the consignment.

When  a  carrier  cannot  carry  out  the  instructions  that  it  receives  in  the
(6)
circumstances referred to in subsection (5)(b), the carrier shall immediately notify
the person who gave the instructions.

A carrier that has not carried out instructions in accordance with subsection
(7)
(5),  or  that  has  carried  them  out  without  requiring  the  first  copy  of  the

86

consignment note to be produced, is liable to the person entitled to make a claim
for any loss or damage caused by that failure.

Requirement of carrier to the consignee upon delivery

107.(1)
After arrival of goods at the place designated for delivery, a consignee
may require the carrier to deliver to him, against a receipt, the second copy of the
consignment note and the goods.

If a loss of goods is established or if goods have not arrived after the expiry
(2)
of the period provided for in section 0, a consignee may enforce in his own name
against the carrier any rights arising from the contract of carriage

A consignee who exercises the rights granted under subsection (1) shall

(3)
pay the charges shown to be due on the consignment note.

If there is a dispute regarding the charges due, the carrier is not required

(4)
to deliver the goods unless security has been furnished by the consignee.

Where terms of contract cannot be fulfilled

108.(1)
If it is or becomes impossible to carry out the contract in accordance
with the terms laid down in the consignment note before the goods reach the place
designated  for  delivery,  the  carrier  shall  ask  for  instructions  from  the  person
entitled to dispose of the goods in accordance with section 106.

If the carriage can be carried out under conditions differing from those laid
(2)
down  in  the  consignment  note  and  if  the  carrier  has  been  unable  to  obtain
instructions in a reasonable time from the person entitled to dispose of the goods
in accordance with section 106, the carrier shall take such steps as seem to it to
be in the best interests of the person entitled to dispose of the goods.

Where goods cannot be delivered after arrival

109.(1)
Where circumstances prevent the delivery of goods after their arrival
at  the  place  designated  for  delivery,  the  carrier  shall  ask  the  sender  for  his
instructions.

87

If a consignee refuses the goods, the sender may dispose of them without

(2)
being obliged to produce the first copy of the consignment note.

(3)
If  a  consignee  has  refused  the  goods,  the  consignee  may  nevertheless
require their delivery so long as the carrier has not received instructions to the
contrary from the sender.

When  circumstances  preventing  delivery  of  the  goods  arise  after  the
(4)
consignee, in the exercise of a right under section 106(3), has given an order for
the goods to be delivered to another person, subsections (1) to (3) shall apply as
if the consignee were the sender and that other person were the consignee.

Carrier’s entitlement to recover cost pertaining to instructions

A carrier is entitled to recover the cost of a request for instructions and
110.(1)
any expenses entailed in carrying out such instructions, unless the expenses were
caused by the wrongful act or neglect of the carrier.

In the circumstances referred to in section 108(1) or section 109, a carrier
(2)
may immediately unload the goods for account of the person entitled to dispose
of them, at which time the carriage is deemed to be at an end.

A carrier who does so shall then hold the goods on behalf of the person
(3)
entitled to dispose of them or entrust them to a third party, in which case the
carrier shall not be under any liability except for the exercise of reasonable care
in the choice of the third party.

In the circumstances referred to in subsections (2) and (3), the charges due
(4)
under  the  consignment  note  and  all  other  expenses  shall  remain  chargeable
against the goods.

A carrier may sell the goods, without awaiting instructions from a person

(5)
entitled to dispose of them, if

(a)

(b)

the goods are perishable or their condition warrants it; or

when the storage expenses would be out of proportion to the value of
the goods,

88

and, after the expiry of a reasonable period, it has not received from the person
entitled to dispose of the goods instructions to the contrary that can reasonably
be carried out.

If  goods  have  been  sold  under  this  section,  the  proceeds  of  sale,  after
(6)
deduction of the expenses chargeable against the goods, shall be placed at the
disposal of the person entitled to dispose of the goods.

If these charges exceed the proceeds of sale, the carrier is entitled to the

(7)
difference.

The  procedure  for  the  sale  of  goods  shall  be  determined  by  the  law  or

(8)
custom of the place where the goods are situated.

Liability of the Carrier

Liability of total or partial loss of goods in the carrier’s care

Subject to subsection (2), a carrier is liable for a total or partial loss
111.(1)
of goods and for damage to them that occurred between the time when the carrier
took over the goods and the time of delivery, as well as for any delay in delivery.

(2)

A carrier is not liable if the loss, damage or delay was caused by

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

the wrongful act or neglect of the claimant;

the instructions of the claimant given otherwise than as the result of a
wrongful act or neglect on the part of the carrier;

an inherent vice of the goods; or

circumstances that the carrier could not avoid and the consequences of
which it was unable to prevent.

(3)

A carrier shall not be relieved of liability by reason of

(a)

the  defective  condition  of  the  vehicle  used  in  order  to  perform  the
carriage; or

89

(b)

the wrongful act or neglect of a person from whom the carrier hired the
vehicle or of the agents or servants of that person.

Subject to sections 112(2) to (5), a carrier is relieved of liability when the

(4)
loss or damage arises from the risks inherent in

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

the use of open un-sheeted vehicles, when their use has been expressly
agreed and specified in the consignment note;

the lack of, or defective condition of, packing of goods that, by their
nature,  are  liable  to  wastage  or  to  be  damaged  when  not  packed  or
properly packed;

handling, loading, stowage or unloading of the goods by the sender,
the  consignee  or  persons  acting  on  behalf  of  the  sender  or  the
consignee;

goods whose nature particularly exposes them to total or partial loss or
to  damage,  especially  through  breakage,  rust,  decay,  desiccation,
leakage, normal wastage or the action of moth or vermin;

(e)

insufficiency or inadequacy of marks or numbers on the packages; or

(f)

the carriage of livestock.

A carrier is liable only to the extent that the factors for which it is liable

(5)
under this section have contributed to the loss, damage or delay.

Burden of proof

112.(1)
the causes specified in section 111(2) shall rest upon the carrier.

The burden of proving that a loss, damage or delay was due to one of

If a carrier establishes that a loss or damage could be attributed to a risks
(2)
referred to in section 111(4), it shall, subject to subsection (3), be presumed that
it was so caused unless the claimant proves that the loss or damage was not, in
fact, attributable either wholly or partly to one of those risks.

90

(3)
The  presumption  referred  to  in  subsection  (2)  shall  not  apply  in  the
circumstances set out in section 111(4)(b), if there has been an abnormal shortage
of packing, or a loss of any package.

(4)
If the carriage is performed in vehicles specially equipped to protect the
goods from the effects of heat, cold, variations in temperature or the humidity of
the air, the carrier shall not be entitled to claim the benefit of section 111(4)(a),
unless it proves that all steps incumbent on it in the circumstances with respect
to  the  choice,  maintenance  and  use  of  such  equipment  were  taken  and  that  it
complied with any instructions issued to it.

A  carrier  shall  not  be  entitled  to  claim  the  benefit  of  section  111(4)(f),
(5)
unless it proves that all steps normally incumbent on it in the circumstances were
taken and that it complied with any instructions issued to it.

Recovery of lost goods

A  claimant  may,  on  receipt  of  compensation  for  missing  goods,
113.(1)
request in writing that he shall be notified immediately if the goods are recovered
in the course of the year following the payment of compensation.

A request under subsection (1) shall be acknowledged in writing by the

(2)
person to whom the claimant made the request.

Within the 30 days following receipt of notification that goods have been
(3)
recovered, the claimant may require the goods to be delivered to him against
payment of the charges shown to be due on the consignment note and the refund
of the compensation received, less those charges, but without prejudice to any
claim to compensation for delay in delivery under section 116 or 119.

In  the  absence  of  a  request  mentioned  in  subsection  (1)  or  of  any
(4)
instructions given within the period of 30 days specified in subsection (3), or if
the  goods  are  not  recovered  until  more  than  one  year  after  the  payment  of
compensation, the carrier is entitled to deal with them in accordance with the law
of the place where the goods are situated.

91

Carrier liable to sender if cash on delivery not collected

If goods have been delivered to the consignee without collection of a
114.
cash-on-delivery charge that should have been collected by the carrier under the
terms  of  the  contract  of  carriage,  the  carrier  is  liable  to  the  sender  for
compensation not exceeding the amount of that charge without prejudice to its
right of action against the consignee.

Sender’s obligation to inform carrier of dangerous goods

When a sender hands goods of a dangerous nature to a carrier, he shall
115.(1)
inform the carrier of the exact nature of the danger and indicate, if necessary, the
precautions to be taken.

If this information has not been entered in the consignment note, the burden
(2)
of proving, by some other means, that the carrier knew the exact nature of the
danger constituted by the carriage of the goods shall rest upon the sender or the
consignee.

Goods of a dangerous nature that were not entered in the consignment note
(3)
and that the carrier did not know were dangerous may, at any time or place, be
unloaded, destroyed or rendered harmless by the carrier without compensation
to the sender and the sender is liable for all expenses, loss or damage arising out
of their handing over for carriage or of their carriage.

Calculation of compensation for the carrier

116.(1)
When a carrier is liable under this Act for compensation in respect of
a total or partial loss of goods, the compensation shall, subject to subsection (3),
be calculated by reference to the value of the goods at the place and time at which
they were accepted for carriage.

(2)

The value of goods shall be fixed according to

(a)

(b)

the commodity exchange price;

if there is no commodity exchange price, the current market price; or

92

(c)

if there is no commodity exchange price or current market price, the
normal value of goods of the same kind and quality.

Compensation  shall  not  exceed  25  francs  per  kilogram  of  gross  weight

(3)
short.

(4)

In subsection (3),

“franc” means a gold franc weighing 10/31 of a gramme and being of millesimal

fineness 900.

Carriage charges, customs duties and other charges incurred in respect of
(5)
the carriage of the goods shall be refunded in full in the case of a total loss, and
in proportion to the loss sustained in the case of a partial loss.

In the case of a delay in delivery, if the claimant proves that damage has
(6)
resulted from the delay, the carrier shall pay compensation for that damage in an
amount not exceeding the carriage charges.

Compensation higher than that provided by this section may be claimed
(7)
only  where  the  value  of  the  goods  or  a  special  interest  in  delivery  has  been
declared in accordance with sections 117 and 119.

Payment of surcharged for goods exceeding limit

117.
A sender may, on payment of a surcharge to be agreed upon, declare
in the consignment note a value for the goods exceeding the limit laid down in
section 116(3), in which case the amount of the declared value shall be substituted
for that limit.

Carrier’s liability where goods have been diminished in value

118.(1)
In the case of damage to goods, the carrier is liable for the amount by
which the goods have diminished in value, calculated by reference to the value
of the goods fixed in accordance with sections 116(1), (2) and (5).

93

(2)

Compensation under subsection (1) may not, however, exceed

(a)

(b)

if the whole consignment has been damaged, the amount payable in
the case of a total loss; and

if only part of the consignment has been damaged, the amount payable
in the case of a loss of that part.

Sender’s obligation on payment of a surcharge in case of loss or
damage

A sender may, on payment of a surcharge to be agreed upon, fix the
119.(1)
amount of a special interest in delivery in the case of loss of or damage to the
goods  where  the  agreed  time-limit  for  delivery  is  exceeded,  by  entering  that
amount in the consignment note.

If  a  declaration  of  a  special  interest  in  delivery  has  been  made,
(2)
compensation for the loss or damage proved due to delay may be claimed, up to
the total amount of the interest declared, in addition to the compensation provided
for in sections 116, 117, and 118.

Claimant’s right to claim interest on compensation payable

120.(1)
A  claimant  is  entitled  to  claim  interest  on  compensation  payable,
calculated at 5 per cent per annum, accruing from the date on which the claim
was sent in writing to the carrier or, if no such claim has been made, from the
date on which legal proceedings were instituted.

When the amounts on which the calculation of the compensation is based
(2)
are not expressed in the currency of the country in which payment is claimed,
conversion shall be at the rate of exchange applicable on the day and at the place
of payment of compensation.

Circumstances in which carrier can exclude liability

121.(1)
Where, under the applicable law, a loss, damage or delay arising out
of carriage under this Act gives rise to an extra-contractual claim, the carrier may

94

avail itself of the provisions of this Act that exclude its liability or fix or limit the
compensation due.

Where an extra-contractual liability for loss, damage or delay of a person
(2)
for whom the carrier is responsible under the terms of section 97 is in issue, that
person may avail himself of the provisions of this Act that exclude the liability
of the carrier or that fix or limit the compensation due.

Circumstances in which carrier cannot exclude or limit liability

A carrier shall not be entitled to avail itself of the provisions of this
122.(1)
Act that exclude or limit its liability or that shift the burden of proof, if the damage
was caused by its wilful misconduct or by a default on its part.

Subsection (1) applies to wilful misconduct or default committed by an
(2)
agent or servant of the carrier, or by any other persons of whose services it makes
use of for the performance of the carriage, when that agent, servant or other person
is acting within the scope of his employment.

An agent, servant or other person referred to in subsection (2) shall not be
(3)
entitled to an exclusion or limitation of liability, or a shift in the burden of proof,
referred to in subsection (1).

Claims and Actions

Consignee’s obligation to check goods

123.(1)

condition with the carrier, or without sending the carrier a reservation giving a
general indication of loss or damage, not later than at the time of delivery, in the
case of apparent loss or damage, or within 7 days of delivery in the case of loss
or damage that is not apparent, the fact of taking delivery shall be prima facie
evidence that the consignee has received the goods in the condition described in
the consignment note.

95

Where the loss or damage is not apparent, the reservation referred to in

(2)
subsection (1) shall be made in writing.

(3)
If the condition of the goods has been duly checked by the consignee and
the carrier, evidence contradicting the result of this check shall be admissible
only  if  the  loss  or  damage  is  not  apparent  and  if  the  consignee  has  duly  sent
reservations in writing to the carrier within 7 days from the date of checking.

No compensation is payable for a delay in delivery unless a reservation
(4)
has been sent in writing to the carrier within 21 days from the time that the goods
were placed at the disposal of the consignee.

In calculating the time limits provided for in this Part, the date of delivery,
(5)
the date of checking or the date when the goods were placed at the disposal of
the consignee, as the case may be, shall not be included.

The  carrier  and  the  consignee  shall  give  each  other  every  reasonable

(6)
facility for making the required investigations and checks.

Where in respect of a claim referred to in subsection (1) an action is pending
(2)
before a court or tribunal referred to in that subsection, or where in respect of
such a claim a judgement has been entered by such a court or tribunal, no new

96

action shall be started between the same parties on the same grounds unless the
judgement of the court or tribunal before which the first action was brought is
not enforceable in the country in which the fresh proceedings are brought.

When a judgement entered by a court or tribunal of a contracting country
(3)
in an action referred to in subsection (1) has become enforceable in that country,
it shall also become enforceable in each of the other states of the contracting
parties, as soon as the formalities required in the country concerned have been
complied with.

The formalities referred to in subsection (3) shall not permit the merits of

(4)
the case to be re-opened.

Subsection  (3)  applies  to  judgements  after  trial,  judgements  by  default,

(c)

in all other cases, 3 months after the making of the contract of carriage.

(4)
A written claim shall suspend the period of limitation until the date that
the carrier rejects the claim by notification in writing and returns the documents
attached to it.

If a part of the claim is admitted, the period of limitation shall start to run

(5)
again only in respect of the part of the claim that still in dispute.

The burden of proof of the receipt of a claim, of a reply and of the return

(6)
of documents shall rest with the party relying upon these facts.

The running of a period of limitation shall not be suspended by further

(7)
claims having the same object.

Subject to subsection (2), the extension of a period of limitation and the

fresh  accrual  of  rights  of  action  shall  be  governed  by  the  law  of  the  court  or
tribunal seized of the case.

Counter-claim concerning claim on the same contract of carriage

Except in the case of a counter-claim or a set-off raised in an action
129.(1)
concerning a claim based on the same contract of carriage, legal proceedings in
respect of liability for loss, damage or delay may be brought only against the first
carrier,  the  last  carrier  or  the  carrier  who  was  performing  that  portion  of  the
carriage during which the event causing the loss, damage or delay occurred.

An action may nonetheless be brought at the same time against more than

(2)
one of the carriers referred to in subsection (1).

Carrier entitled to recover compensation

A  carrier  who  has  paid  compensation  under  this  Act  is  entitled  to
130.
recover  that  compensation,  together  with  interest  and  all  costs  and  expenses
incurred by reason of the claim, from the other carriers who have taken part in
the carriage, but

(a)

compensation, interest, costs and expenses, whether paid by itself or
by another carrier;

99

(b)

(c)

when the loss or damage has been caused by the action of two or more
carriers, each of them shall pay an amount proportionate to its share of
liability or, if it is impossible to apportion the liability, each carrier is
liable in proportion to the share of the payment for the carriage that is
due to it; and

if it cannot be ascertained to which carriers liability is attributable for
the  loss  or  damage,  the  amount  of  the  compensation  shall  be
apportioned between all the carriers in proportion to the share of the
payment for the carriage that is due to each of them.

Where carrier is insolvent

If one of the carriers is insolvent, the share of the compensation due
131.
from it and unpaid by it shall be divided among the other carriers in proportion
to the share of the payment for the carriage due to them.

Where carrier is not entitled to dispute validity of payment

No carrier against whom a claim is made under section 130 or section
132.(1)
131 is entitled to dispute the validity of the payment made by the carrier making
the  claim,  if  the  amount  of  the  compensation  was  determined  by  a  judicial
authority after the carrier against whom the claim was made was given due notice
of the proceedings and afforded an opportunity to enter an appearance.

A carrier may enforce its right of recovery by making a claim before a

(2)
competent court or tribunal of the country in which

(a)

(b)

(c)

one of the carriers concerned is ordinarily resident;

the carrier has its principal place of business; or

the branch or agency through which the contract of carriage was made

(5)
Section 120 shall apply to claims between carriers, though the period of
limitation shall begin to run on the date of the final judicial decision fixing the

Nullity of Stipulations Contrary to the Act

Where provisions are void

Subject to section 133, any stipulation in a contract of carriage that
134.(1)
would directly or indirectly derogate from the provisions of this Act, including
a benefit-of-insurance clause in favour of the carrier or any other similar clause,
or any clause shifting the burden of proof, is void.

The nullity of a stipulation under subsection (1) does not nullify any other
