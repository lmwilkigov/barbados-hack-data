Trafficking in Persons Prevention Bill, 2015

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

SUMMARY
The purpose of this Bill is to repeal the Transnational Organized Crime (Prevention and
Control) Act, 2011 (Act 2011-3) in order to make fuller provision for the prevention of
the  trafficking  in  persons  and  the  implementation  of  the  United  Nations  Protocol  to

Prevent,  Suppress  and  Punish  Trafficking  in  Persons,  Especially  Women  and
Children,  supplementing
the  United  Nations  Convention  Against  Transnational
Organized Crime.

The Bill broadens the scope of the offences by creating an offence where trafficking in
persons  takes  place  within  the  country  and  creates  a  special  offence  with  heavier
penalties in relation to the trafficking of children.

The Bill now makes extensive provision for the protection of victims and the treatment of
victims.  Certain  privileges  relating  to  immigration  matters  and  legal  proceedings  are
granted  to  victims.  Special  provision  is  made  for  the  treatment  of  victims  who  are
children.

This Bill is related to  the Immigration Amendment (No.    )  Bill, 2015 and the Criminal
Assets Recovery Fund Bill, 2015 which also make better provision for other aspects of the
Convention  Against  Transnational  Organized  Crime.  The  first  mentioned  Bill  will
provide  for  the  offence  of  the  smuggling  of  persons  on  the  repeal  of  the  Transnational
Organized Crime (Prevention and Control) Act. The amendment to the Immigration Act
reflects  the  fact  that  the  offences  created  are  essentially  immigration  offences  and  that
prevention lies in strong border control.

The  Criminal  Assets  Recovery  Fund  Bill,  2015  will  provide  on  the  repeal  of  the
Transnational Organized Crime (Prevention and Control) Act, 2011 for the continuation
of  the  Criminal  Assets  Recovery  Fund  in  which  confiscated  proceeds  of  crime  are

deposited. Providing for these matters in a separate Bill emphasizes the fact that the Fund
relates to all proceeds of crime and not only to transnational organized crime.

The Bill makes no specific reference to organized criminal groups within the meaning of
Article 5 of the Convention as the general law will apply. The offences in the Bill will
apply  not  only  to  individuals  but  also  where  two  or  more  persons  are  acting  in  concert
(also  referred  to  as  “joint  criminal  enterprise”).  In  particular,  the  law  relating  to
conspiracy, inchoate offences and accomplices will apply.  The Bill also makes specific
provision for the important inchoate offence of incitement and the secondary offence of
receiving financial benefit from the offence of trafficking in persons.

Clause 1: Short title
This clause provides for the short title.

Clause 2: Interpretation
This  clause  provides  definitions  for  the  terms  used  in  the  Bill.  In  particular,  the  term
“exploitation”  is  widely  defined  in  accordance  with  Article  3  (a)  of  the  Protocol  to
include slavery, sexual servitude, prostitution, child pornography and the illicit removal
of organs.

The  term  “child”  carries  the  same  definition  as  the  Protocol.  That  term  is  defined  in
Article 3 (d) of Protocol.

Clause 3: Offence of trafficking in persons
This clause specifies the elements of the offence of trafficking in persons, including the
inchoate offence of inciting another to commit the offence. Despite the narrow scope of
application  in  Article  4  of  the  Protocol,  the  offence  created  in  this  clause  need  not  be
transnational  in  nature  or  involve  an  organized  criminal  group.  The  clause  therefore
follows  Article  34  (2)  of  the  Convention  which  requires  that  offences  should  be
“established in domestic law independently of the transnational nature or the involvement
of an organized criminal  group”. The offence is therefore committed whether the act is
committed by an individual or by several persons acting in concert.

Clause 4: Trafficking in children
In accordance with the Article 3 (c) of the Protocol a stricter offence is created in relation
to the trafficking in children.

Clause 5: Consent is not a defence and past sexual behaviour inadmissible
This clause complies with Article 3 (b) of the Protocol by providing that the consent of a
victim to exploitation should not be a defence to the charge of trafficking in persons.

Clause 6: Unlawfully destroying or withholding travel document etc.
This  clause  creates  a  special  offence  in  relation  to  destroying  or  withholding  travel
documents as this is a common means of securing the exploitation of persons.

Clause  7:  Transporting  a  person  for  the  purpose  of  exploiting  that  person’s
prostitution
This  clause  creates  a  special  offence  in  relation  to  sexual  exploitation  as  a  means  of
preventing this type of exploitation.

Clause 8: Knowingly receiving financial benefit from trafficking in persons
This clause creates an offence for the purpose of punishing accomplices and accessories
to the offence of trafficking in persons.

Clause 9: Knowingly receiving financial benefit from trafficking in children
This  clause  creates  a  special  offence  with  heavier  penalties  where  financial  benefit  is
derived from trafficking in children.

Clause 10: Forfeiture
This  clause  implements  Articles  12,  13  and  14  of  the  Convention  by  providing  for  a
regime of forfeiture and the disposal of the funds so forfeited.

Clause 11: Restitution
This  clause  makes  provision  for  restitution  to  be  made  to  victims  in  appropriate
circumstances and in particular it implements Article 14 (2) of the Convention.

Clause 12: Offences of bodies corporate
This clause supplements the general law relating to the prosecution of corporate bodies in
accordance with Article 10 of the Convention and provides for the imposition of heavy
penalties where an offence is committed under the Act.

Clause 13: Additional penalties
This clause provides for action to be taken to close businesses which are involved in the
commission of offences under the Act.

Clause 14: Victim may offer a defence
This clause in accordance with Article 6 (2) gives a victim of trafficking the right to give
evidence to prove that he or she was not complicit in the offence of trafficking but was
genuinely exploited.

Clause 15: Protection and safety of victims
This clause implements Article 6 of the Protocol by making provision for the protection
of victims of trafficking from recapture and reprisals.

Clause 16: Privacy of victims
This clause provides for hearings to be held in camera and gives victims the right to have
their identity protected in accordance with Article 6 (1) of the Protocol.

Clause 17: Information for victims
This clause in accordance with Article 6 (2) makes provision for pertinent information to
be given to victims in relation to their immigration status and any legal proceedings that
may be undertaken.

Clause 18: Assistance to victims
This  clause  implements  Article  6  (3)  to  (5)  of  the  Protocol  by  making  provision  for
financial, social and legal assistance to be granted to victims of trafficking.

Clause 19: Immigration regime for victims
This clause provides for immigration leniency to be provided to victims of trafficking in
accordance with Article 7 of the Protocol.

Clause 20: Return of victims to home country
This  clause  provides  for  a  repatriation  regime  in  accordance  with  Article  8  of  the
Protocol.

Clause 21: Special considerations for child victims
