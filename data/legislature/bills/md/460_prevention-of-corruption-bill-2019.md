fulfilled, the judge may make an order authorising the officer to give to any person
the  officer  considers  has  relevant  information,  notice  in  writing  requiring  the
person, with respect to any matter relevant to the investigation for the purposes
of which the order is sought, to

(a)

(b)

(c)

answer any question, either at a time specified in the notice or at once,
at a place so specified;

manner so specified.

An application for a disclosure order shall be made without notice and shall
(2)
state that a person specified in the application is subject to an investigation under
this Act.

18

The requirements referred to in subsection (1) are that there are reasonable

(3)
grounds for

(a)

suspecting that the person specified in the application has committed
an offence under Part II; and

(b)

believing that

(i)

(ii)

information which may be provided in compliance with the order
is likely to be of substantial value, whether or not by itself, to the
investigation for the purposes of which the order is sought; and

it is in the public interest for the information to be provided, having
regard  to  the  benefit  likely  to  accrue  to  the  investigation  if  the
information is obtained.

(9)
unless

(a)

(b)

evidence relating to it is adduced; or

a question relating to it is asked,

by or on behalf of the person in the proceedings arising out of the prosecution.

A  disclosure  order  has  effect  notwithstanding  any  obligation  as  to
(10)
confidentiality  or  any  other  restriction  upon  the  disclosure  of  information
imposed by any enactment, rule of law or otherwise.

A disclosure order does not require a person to provide privileged material
(11)
but an attorney-at-law may be required to produce the name and address of a
client.

An investigative officer may take copies of or extracts from any documents
(12)
produced  by  a  person  in  connection  with  complying  with  a  requirement  of  a
disclosure order.

20

(13)
Any document produced in compliance with a disclosure order may be
retained for so long as it is necessary to retain it, as opposed to copies of it, in
connection with the investigation for the purposes of which the order was made.

Notwithstanding  subsection  (13),  where  an  investigative  officer  has

(14)
reasonable grounds for believing that the document

(a)

may need to be produced for the purposes of any legal proceedings;
and

(b)

might otherwise be unavailable for those purposes,

the document may be retained until the proceedings are concluded.

An investigative officer who applied for a disclosure order or any person
(15)
affected by the order may apply to a judge in Chambers to vary or discharge the
order, and the judge may do so where he considers it appropriate.

For the purposes of subsection (1), “relevant information” is information,
(16)
whether or not contained in a document, which the investigative officer considers
to be relevant to the investigation.

16.(1)
Where on an application made by an investigative officer, a magistrate
is satisfied of the circumstances set out in subsection (3), the magistrate may issue
a warrant authorising the officer to

(a)

(b)

enter  and  search  the  premises  specified  in  the  application  for  the
warrant; and

seize and retain any material found on the premises which is likely to
be of substantial value, whether or not by itself, to the investigation for
the purposes of which the application is made.

(2)

An application for a search and seizure warrant shall

(a)

(b)

specify the person subject to investigation;

state that the warrant is sought for the purposes of the investigation;

21

(c)

(d)

specify the premises in respect of which the warrant is sought; and

the premises that

(i)

(ii)

relates to the person specified in the application or the question
whether that person has committed an offence under Part II; and

is likely to be of substantial value, whether or not by itself, to the
investigation for the purposes of which the warrant is sought.

(3)

The circumstances referred to in subsection (1) are that

(a)

(b)

a disclosure order in relation to material has not been complied with
and there are reasonable grounds for believing that the material is on
the premises specified in the application for the warrant; or

there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the person specified
in the application for the warrant has committed an offence under Part
II and

(i)

the conditions specified in subsection (4) are fulfilled; or

(ii)

the conditions specified in subsection (5) are fulfilled.

(4)

The conditions referred to in subsection (3)(b)(i) are that

(a)

(i)

any material on the premises specified in the application for the
warrant is likely to be of substantial value, whether or not by itself,
to the investigation for the purposes of which the warrant is sought;
and

(ii)

it is in the public interest for the material to be obtained, having
regard  to  the  benefit  likely  to  accrue  to  the  investigation  if  the
material is obtained; and

22

(b)

it would not be appropriate to make a disclosure order because

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

it  is  not  practicable  to  communicate  with  any  person  against
whom the disclosure order could be made;

it is not practicable to communicate with any person who would
be required to comply with an order to grant entry to the premises;
or

the  investigation  might  be  seriously  prejudiced  unless  an
investigative  officer  is  able  to  secure  immediate  access  to  the
material.

(5)

The conditions referred to in subsection (3)(b)(ii) are that

(a)

there are reasonable grounds for believing where the material cannot
be identified at the time of the application, that there is material on the
premises specified in the application for the warrant that

(i)

(ii)

relates to the person specified in the application or the question
whether he has committed an offence under Part II; and

is likely to be of substantial value, whether or not by itself, to the
investigation for the purposes of which the warrant is sought; and

(b)

there are reasonable grounds for believing that it is in the public interest
for the material to be obtained, having regard to the benefit likely to
accrue to the investigation if the material is obtained; and

(c)

one of the following applies:

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

it  is  not  practicable  to  communicate  with  any  person  against
whom a disclosure order could be made;

entry  to  the  premises  will  not  be  granted  unless  a  warrant  is
produced; or

the  investigation  might  be  seriously  prejudiced  unless  an
investigative  officer  arriving  at  the  premises  is  able  to  secure
immediate entry to them.

23

A search and seizure warrant does not confer the right to seize privileged

(6)
material.

Offence of tipping off etc.

under Part II has been, is being, or is about to be conducted, or that an order under
this Part has been made or may be made and

(a)

(b)

divulges that fact or other information to another person whereby the
investigation is likely to be prejudiced; or

falsifies,  conceals,  destroys  or  otherwise  disposes  of,  or  causes  or
permits the falsification, concealment, destruction or disposal of, any
matter or thing that he knows or suspects is or is likely to be relevant
to the investigation,

is guilty of an offence and is liable, on conviction on indictment to a fine of $250
000 or to imprisonment for 10 years or to both.

24

(b)

the person had, at or about the date of, or at any time since the date of,
the  alleged  offence,  obtained  an  accretion  to  property  for  which  he
cannot satisfactorily account,

any  witness  giving  evidence  in  such  proceedings  that  the  person  solicited  or
accepted an advantage and showing that such advantage was solicited or accepted
as an inducement or reward.
