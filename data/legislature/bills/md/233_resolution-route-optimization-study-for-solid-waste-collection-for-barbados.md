Summary

Increased  consumption,  construction  and  other  development  activities  has  resulted  in

increased rates of waste and recyclable generation in Barbados and Barbados is putting a lot of

effort and resources in improving the collection, disposal and management of solid waste in order

to  better  serve  residents  and  visitors.    The  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Drainage  (MED)  of

Barbados, Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and Export-Import Bank of Korea (KEXIM)

agreed  to  proceed  with  a  KSP-IDB  Joint  Consulting  Project  to  study  route  optimization  and  to

determine  the  improvement  points  for  the  solid  waste  collection  and  management  process  in

Barbados.

This  report  provides  the  details  of  the  results  of  the  Consulting  Project  called  the

“Consultancy  for  the  Development  of  Route  Optimization  Study  in  Solid  Waste  Collection  in

Barbados”.    During the first mission trip for the Project, the KSP Consultants conducted As-Is

Analysis  of  the  current  status  and  environment  of  solid  waste  collection,  disposal  and

management  in  Barbados.    From  the  As-Is  Analysis  and analysis  of  case  studies  in  Korea,  the

KSP  Consultants  determined  improvement  points  for  solid  waste  collection,  disposal  and

management  in  Barbados  in  terms  of  process  improvements,  system  improvements,  and

equipment improvements.

A  Dissemination  Seminar  was  conducted  in  Barbados  with  the  key  stakeholders  in  order  to

present  the  findings  of  the  report  and  to  discuss  the  improvement  points  in  more  detail.    The

Dissemination Seminar was attended by the representatives from the IDB, Project Management

Coordination Unit (PMCU), Sanitation Services Authority (SSA) and Environmental Protection

Agency.    The  suggestions  and  comments  raised  during  the  Dissemination  Seminar  were

incorporated into the final report and presented during the Capacity Building Workshop (CBW)

which was also held in Barbados.    Representatives for nine (9) neighboring Caribbean countries

were  invited  to  attend  the  CBW  to  present  their  current  status  and  future  plans  for  solid  waste

collection and management in their respective countries as well as discuss future needs and plans

for the whole Caribbean region.

I.  Project Overview

### 1.  Project Background and Objectives

##### 1.1. Project Background

Since  2004,  the  Ministry  of  Strategy  and  Finance  of  Korea  had  been  initiating  and

sponsoring the KSP (Knowledge Sharing Program) with the Export-Import Bank of Korea as

its  execution  agency.    Every  year  more  than  10  KSP  Consulting  Projects  are  executed  in

various underdeveloped countries in diverse fields and industries where Korea’s knowledge

and experience in the diverse fields and industries are shared with the recipient countries in

order to help the recipient countries leap-frog to the next level of advancement without going

through  the  pains  and  mistakes  that  might  arise  through  trial-and-error  processes.    The

economies  of  the  recipient  countries  will  also  be  able  to  grow  and  prosper  through  the

knowledge gained from the KSP Consulting Projects.

In  Barbados,  increased  consumption, construction  and  other development  activities  had

resulted  in  increased  rates  of  waste  and  recyclable  generation.    In  2008,  Barbados

constructed  the  Sustainable  Barbados  Recycling  Center  (SBRC)  to  properly  manage  the

collection  and  disposal  of  waste.    Barbados  is  putting  a  lot  of  effort  and  resources  into

improving  the  collection,  processing,  disposal  and  management  of  solid  waste  in  order  to

better serve residents and visitors.    The Ministry of Environment and Drainage (MED), IDB

and  KEXIM  agreed  to  proceed  with  a  KSP-IDB  Joint  Consulting  Project  to  study  route

optimization and to determine the improvement points for the solid waste collection process

and systems in Barbados.

In 2014 Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) sponsored the Caribbean Conference

on  Solid  Waste  Management  in  Jamaica  and  the  Conference  was  attended  by  the

representatives  from  some  countries  in  the  Caribbean  and  Central  America.    Presentations

were  made  by  individual  countries  to  explain  the  current  status  and  future  plans  for  solid

waste management in their countries.    To continue the practice, IDB and KEXIM (Export-

Import  Bank  of  Korea)  agreed  to  conduct  a  similar  conference  in  Barbados  in  2015  as  a

4

2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)

Capacity Building Workshop where representatives from some neighboring countries along

with  Barbados  were  able  to  present  the  current  status  and  future  plans  for  solid  waste

collection  and  management  in  their  respective  countries.    In  addition,  IDB  and  KEXIM

shared the results of this Consulting Project, including the Best Practices and case studies in

Korea,  with  the  representatives  from  the  other  neighboring  countries  who  attended  the

Capacity  Building  Workshop  in  order  for  all  participants  to  share  ideas  and  direction  for

advancements in processes and systems related to solid waste collection in the region.

##### 1.2. Project Objectives

The  Consulting  Project’s  main  objective  was  to  conduct  a  route  optimization  study  for

solid waste collection in Barbados.    Currently in Barbados, there are a number of problems

that  are  arising  due  to  inefficient  solid  waste  collection  such  as  stacking  of  solid  waste

waiting to be picked up, illegal dumping of solid waste, and others.    The Consulting Project

proposed solutions and alternatives to solving the current problems and issues related to solid

waste  collection  and  management  in  order  to  make  the  solid  waste  collection  and

management activities more efficient and standardized.

### 2.  Scope of Works

##### 2.1. Main Areas of Focus

#########   Solid waste collection process is not a stand-alone process that can be analyzed and

managed independently; therefore, recycling process and solid waste disposal process

will be included in the overall analysis and study.

#########   Hazardous waste collection was not included in this study where “hazardous waste” is

defined  as  1)  characteristic  waste  which  are  materials  that  are  known  or  tested  to

exhibit  one  or  more  of  the  following  four  hazardous  traits:  ignitability,  reactivity,

corrosivity,  and/or  toxicity  and  2)  listed  hazardous  wastes  which  are  materials

specifically listed by regulatory authorities as a hazardous waste which are from non-

specific sources, specific sources, or discarded chemical products.

5

2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)

  This study concentrated on residential waste with some consideration of commercial

waste while industrial waste was not covered..

##### 2.2. Project Implementation Plan

The  Consulting  Project  was  executed  in  four  stages  :  Preparation  and  As-Is  Analysis

Stage, Case Study and Recommendation Stage, Dissemination Seminar Stage, and Capacity

3.  Expected Results

The following were the expected results of the Consulting Project:

#########   With Barbados as the key reference site and since Barbados is one of the leading

countries  in  the  Caribbean  in  terms  of  solid  waste  collection  and  management,

improvement  points  and  advanced  systems  and  processes  proposed  in  this

Consulting  Project  could  also  be  expanded  and  adapted  to  other  neighboring

countries  in  order  to  raise  the  overall  level  of  solid  waste  collection  and

management throughout the Caribbean.

#########   The results of the Consulting Project could be used as the basis for future projects

in  solid  waste  collection,  disposal  and  management.    Barbados  will  be  able  to

apply  for  IDB,  GCF  (Green  Climate  Fund)  or  other  ODA  (Official  Direct

Assistance) funds as a follow up project from the results of this Consulting Project.

II.  Analysis of Current Status

### 1.  Law and Policy in Barbados

##### 1.1.   Organization

The main organization concerning solid waste management in Barbados is the Ministry

of  Environment  and  Drainage  (MED)  and  the  MED  is  responsible  for  developing  and

executing  the  law,  regulation  and  policies  related  to  solid  waste  collection,  disposal  and

management.    Under the MED, there are three main departments who are involved in solid

waste  management  and  they  are  the  Project  Management  Coordination  Unit  (PMCU),

Sanitation  Services  Authority  (SSA)  and  the  Environmental  Protection  Department  (EPD)

(Please refer to Figure II-1 on the next page).    PMCU is responsible for the implementation

of  the  Integrated  Solid  Waste  Management  Programme  (ISWMP)  and  they  are  the  main

counterpart  organization  for  this  Consulting  project.    SSA  is  a  quasi-government  agency

responsible  for  the  collection  and  disposal  of  solid  waste.    EPD  is  responsible  for  the

regulation, enforcement and monitoring of the laws related to solid waste collection, disposal,

and management.    The Environmental Health Department (EHD) works in conjunction with

the  EPD;  however,  EHD  is  not  part  of  the  MED  but  under  the  Ministry  of  Health.    The

Sustainable Barbados Recycling Center (SBRC) is a PPP (Public Private Partnership) where

the  SSA  reimburses  SBRC  for  some  of  the  services  SBRC  provide  such  as  1)  automatic

weighing  of  collection  trucks  as  the  trucks  enter  and  leave  SBRC,  2)  acting  as  a  transfer

station where wastes are unloaded and separated prior to the delivery to the landfill, and 3)

recycling of the waste that are unloaded by the collection trucks.

There  are  around  12  private  companies  involved  in  solid  waste  collection  and

management  and  the  three  largest  are  Simpson Trucking  and  Skip  Services, Jose and Jose,

and Garbage Master.    There are also some companies involved in recycling paper, plastic,

glass,  metal,  etc.  and  the  three  largest  are  B’  Recycling,  Ace  Recycling  and  Scrap  Man.

Other  than  the  recycling  companies,  all  the  private  haulers  also  take  their  collected  solid

waste to the SBRC to be processed and reside disposed of at the landfill.

##### 1.2. Solid Waste Related Law and Policy

The main laws related to solid waste is the “Waste Management Act”(draft version) and

the  “Licensing  Relations”  related  to  the  execution  of  the  law.    Other  related  laws  are  the

Sanitary Service Act, Health Service Act, Town and Country Planning Act, Marine Pollution

Act and the Coastal Zone Management Act.

The  main  policy  related  to  solid  waste  is  the  Integrated  Solid  Waste  Management

Programme  (ISWMP)  which  was  started  in  1993.    There  were  many  revisions  and

amendments  to  the  ISWMP  since  1993  and  it  is also  a  major  part  of  the  government-wide

Barbados Sustainable Development Policy (BSDP) which was launched in 2004.

Solid waste characterization studies are also performed every ten years (1994 and 2005)

and  Barbados  is  currently  undergoing  the  latest  study  where  the  draft  version  of  the  study

was received and was reviewed.    In the “National Strategic Plan of Barbados 2005~2024”,

Major  Target  4  deals  with  “Strengthening  the  Physical  Infrastructure  and  Preserving  the

Environment”  where  solid  waste  management  is  outlined  as  one  of  the  key  issues  that  the

Government of Barbados (GOB) will be focusing on for the next 25 years.

14

2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)

Later,  with  the  emergence  of  national  waste  management  as  an  international

environmental issue, Barbados established the 1993 Health Sector Development Plan and the

ISWMP  is  currently  being  implemented  as  part  of  this  Plan.    The  ISWMP  focuses  on

various stakeholders from both the public and private sectors working together to change the

existing bad practices of illegal disposal of wastes, to minimize the disposal of solid waste,

to  promote  recycling,  and  to  provide  guidance  to  convert  solid  wastes  into  resources.    By

presenting a long term vision for solid waste management for the next 20 years, the goal of

the ISWMP is to develop a modern and sustainable management system that is efficient and

reliable  in  order  to  effectively  manage  the  solid  waste  disposal  throughout  Barbados  and

protect the environment.

The objectives of the ISWMP can be categorized into three parts.    The first objective is

to  reduce  the  disease  and  environmental  contamination  from  wastes  resulting  from  illegal

disposal  and  existing  bad  disposal  practices.    The  second  objective  is  to  improve  the

sanitation standards of Barbados by developing and providing an efficient and reliable solid

waste  management  system,  and  the  third  objective  is  to  provide  programs  to  promote

awareness  and  educate  the  public  in  order  for  the  citizens  of  Barbados  to  manage  the

environment on their own.    The participation of the private sector stakeholders in the solid

waste management system, and the reduction of volume and toxicity of the solid wastes are

also included in the third objective (PAHO, 2003).

The  ISWMP  is  composed  of  physical  elements  and  non-physical  elements.    Physical

elements  are  the  facilities  such  as  the  landfills,  solid  waste  management  depots,  and  large

waste  disposal  facilities.    The  solid  waste disposal  depots  should include transfer  stations,

materials  recovery  facilities,  chemical  waste  storage  facilities,  and  composting  facilities.

Additionally, improving the roads to effectively transport the wastes to the disposal facilities

are also included in this element (PAHO, 2003).

The  non-physical  elements  of  the  ISWMP  are  reinforcing  the  solid  waste  management

system by establishing organizational and advisory groups, who can implement all aspects of

the solid waste disposal process and can supervise the status of progression of the ISWMP.

Developing  policies  and  laws  related  to  improving  solid  waste  disposal,  increasing  public

awareness  and  providing  educational  programs  on  the  importance  of  solid  waste

management  for  various  stakeholders  such  as  employees  of  major  governmental  agencies,

semi-governmental organizations and private waste collection companies are all considered

15

2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)

to  be  non-physical  elements  as  well.    Furthermore,  looking  for  more  economical  ways  to

recoup  the  solid  waste  management  expenses  are  also  included  in  this  category  (PAHO,

2003).

2.  Current Status of Solid Waste Collection in Barbados

##### 2.1. Classification of Waste

The Waste Management Act does not clearly define the classification of waste; however,

generally  the  waste  is  classified  as  1)  Municipal  Solid  Waste  (MSW),  2)  Industrial,

Commercial and Institutional (ICI) or Commercial and Institution (CI), 3) Construction and

Demolition (C&D) waste, and 4) Rock and Soil (R&S).    Another way to classify waste is

by using the content of waste such as 1) garbage or MSW, 2) Green Waste (GW), 3) C&D

and 4) R&S.    The “Characterization Study 2005” classified waste as 1) Residential Refuse

2)  Residential  Yard  Waste,  3)  Commercial  Refuse,  4)  Commercial  Yard  Waste,  5)  Bulky

Waste,  6)  Hazardous  Waste,  7)  Special  Liquid  Waste,  and  8)  Imported  Waste.    The

definition of waste is currently being undertaken in the revised policy.

Since there is no classification of waste defined in the Waste Management Act, there is

also no waste code (number) associated with the different waste classifications.    Waste code

is  very  important  in  the  management  of  waste;  therefore,  the  waste  codes  defined  in  the

characterization  studies  are  currently  being  used  to  manage  the  different  types  of  waste.

We can see a continuous increase in the number of classifications of waste (thus, the number

of  waste  codes)  from  the  initial  characterization  study  performed  in  1995  which  had  34

classes  to  the  latest  study  performed  in  2015  which  has  52  classes.    Currently,  codes  1~8

classifies paper and cardboard, codes 9~13 classifies glass, codes 14~21 metal, codes 22~28

plastic, codes 29~30 textile, codes 37~42 construction waste, codes 43~48 special care waste

and codes 49~52 other waste.    The different codes define the different methods of recycling

and processing of the waste which is a very efficient coding system.    The waste codes can

also be used as keys to identify the different types of waste in a computer system.

##### 2.2. Production of Waste

Usually the increase in waste production is linked with the increase in population and the

increase  in  income.    However,  in  Barbados,  there  is  minimal  increase  in  population;

therefore, the yearly increase in waste production is linked to the increase in GDP.    Before

2001, the yearly increase in waste production was only 3%; however, from 2001 to 2010, the

17

2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)

yearly increase rose to over 11% which is directly linked to the large increase in GDP during

this period.    Then after 2010, the yearly increase has fallen back to the 3% level.

The sum of MSW production and GW production was 150 tons per day in 2001, then in

2010 the amount increased to 400 tons per day and in 2014, the amount has increased to 450

tons per day.    450 tons per day translates to 1.68 kg of waste produced per person every day.

The  average  waste  production  for  advanced  countries  is  about  1  kg  per  person  per  day  so

Barbados’s waste production is much higher than the average and we can assume two main

reasons for this higher amount.    One is because tourism is one of Barbados’ main industries

and the second is due to the large amount of GW produced.

The  total  sum  of  all  waste  produced,  including  MSW,  GW,  C&D  and  R&S,  is  about

1,000 tons per day (300 tons per day for MSW, 150 tons per day for GW, 150 tons per day

for C&D, and 400 tons per day for R&S).    Table II-2 shows the amount of waste received

by SBRC for the last 5 years.    You can see that the total amount of waste received by the

SBRC  has  increased  continuously  for  the  last  5  years.    The  waste  collected  by  SSA

accounts for about 21.7% of the total (78,703 tons out of a total 360,526 tons) and you can

notice that the amount of waste collected by SSA stays rather constant between 77,000 tons

to 83,000 tons per year for the last 5 years which means that the population is not increasing

very much.    The main increase in the total amount of waste comes from the private haulers,

meaning that the increase in waste production is due to increase in tourism and businesses.

2.3. Composition of Waste

Table II-3 shows the composition of MSW and ICI waste in the latest “Characterization

Study 2015”.    For MSW, 36% are organic waste with paper, textile and plastic accounting

for 15%, 11%, and 10%, respectively.    For ICI, 48% are organic waste and 35% are C&D

and these two types of waste account for 83% of all ICI.    Paper, plastic, textile and organic

waste account for 92% of the overall waste production by households and the remaining 8%

are glass and metal waste.

##### 2.4. Waste Management

The general waste management process is as follows:

#########   Generation  →  Storage (on-site)  →  Collection  →  Transportation  →  Processing

Usually,  task  of  collection  and  the  task  of  transportation are  separated and executed  by

different companies or organizations.    In this case, collection can be performed using large

19

2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)

non-compactor  trucks  and  the  waste  delivered  to  transfer  stations  where  the  waste  is

separated and compacted for delivery.    However, in Barbados, due to the small size of the

country,  both  collection  and  transportation  are  carried  out  by  the  same  company  or

organization  using  compactor  trucks.    Also,  there  are  no  in-between  transfer  stations

handling the waste separation prior to delivery to the SBRC.    SBRC can be considered the

only transfer station prior to the delivery to the landfill.

In  Barbados  there  are  no  requirements  for  separation  of  recyclable  waste  versus  non-

recyclable waste.    The only separation of waste done at the households are the separation of

containers made of glass, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), or metal since these containers

can  be  brought  to  recycling  centers  for  exchange  of  money  (based  on  the  Returnable

Containers  Act).    These  recyclable  wastes  account  for  about  20%  of  the  total  waste

generated at the households (about 60 tons per day).

The generated wastes are placed in plastic bags (designated trash bags or regular plastic

bags provided at the markets) and placed at the curb for pick-up.    The plastic bags can just

be piled on the curb or placed in individual trash bins which can be purchased.    The 60 to

100  liter  trash  bins  are  made  of  plastic  with  holes  drilled  at  the  bottom  to  remove  liquid,

which are generated by the waste.    The trash bins make the waste collection easier for the

loaders.    Other  than  households,  skips  can  be  used  to  store  plastic  bags  or  other  trash

generated  by  commercial  businesses  or  apartments.    The  Figure  below  shows  the  storage

on-site of the generated waste in Barbados.

#### Figure II-2 | Waste Storage On-Site

20

2.5. Waste Collection

The  SSA  divides  Barbados  into  5  major  regions  for  waste  collection.    The  regions  are

City  West,  City  East,  South  West,  South  East  and  North  (shown  in  Figure  II-2  below).

Bridgetown,  where  42%  of  the  total  amount  of  waste  is  generated  is  divided  into  two

separate  regions,  City  West  and  City  East.    In  Barbados,  there  are  3  major  depots  where

collection trucks are parked and distributed from.    The Wildey Depot is the main depot with

about 40 trucks (operational or not).    There is a depot in Bridgetown at Reed Street with 1

compactor truck and 1 skip truck.    Finally, there is a small depot in the North at Greenland

with 3 trucks.

Table II-4 shows the amount of waste collected by region in 2014.    There were only 4

regions in 2014 where the South was divided into two regions this year.

The residents bring out their waste to the curb and place the plastic bags on the curb or

put the plastic bags into 60 to 100 liter trash bins.    Barbados is currently using a house-to-

house,  “alley  service”  method  of  collection.    In  larger  apartments  or  buildings,  skip

container  based  “block  service”  method  of  collection  is  being  used.    In  the  city,  street

cleaners roll along large garbage cans to place sweep the streets as well as collect garbage

from  trash  bins  or  directly  from  the  streets.    Figure  II-4  shows  the  type  of  collection

equipment used by SSA.

Comparing  waste  management  status  of  Barbados  with  the  current  waste  management

status  of  Seoul,  Korea,  the  land  area  of  Barbados  is  about  71%  of  the  land  area  of  Seoul;

however, Barbados only has 2.6% of Seoul’s population, 5.3% of Seoul’s waste generation,

5.0% of persons associated with waste collection and 3.5% of the number of waste collection

equipment (please refer to Table II-5 below).

##### 2.6. Waste Processing

The  waste  processing  in  Barbados  has  a  very  simple  structure.    Recyclable  goods

collected at the private recycling companies and the SBRC are mostly exported to China or

to South America.    Most of the MSW generated are buried in the Mangrove Pond Landfill

without incineration.

Figure  II-4  shows  the  waste  collection,  disposal  and  management  process  in  Barbados

depending  on  the  classification  of  waste.    About  1,000  tons  of  waste  are  collected  and

23

2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)

delivered to the SBRC every day (MSW 300 tons/day, GW 150 tons/day, C&D 150 tons/day,

and R&S 400 tons/day).    SSA is responsible for collecting about 180 tons of waste per day

and  the  remaining  800+  tons  of  waste  are  being  collected  by  private  companies.    Most  of

the 1,000 tons of waste collected per day either go to the landfill to be buried (400 tons/day)

or is being used for land reclamation (540 tons/day).    The remaining 60 tons of waste are

being recycled; therefore, about 6% of the total amount of waste is being recycled which is

very low compared to Korea where about 60% of the waste is being recycled.    Recycling is

important because it diverts a large amount of waste going to the landfill.

3.  Problems and Issues

The  two  biggest  problems  and  issues  in  waste  collection  in  Barbados  are  1)  collection

trucks and 2) roads.    In case of collection trucks, the biggest problem is that the trucks and

facilities are old and outdated.    There should have been a continuous purchasing of at least

a small number of trucks every year or every two years; however, in Barbados, large number

of trucks were purchased in 1999, 2005 and 2013 without replenishing fleet in other years.

Since the trucks are old and overworked, there are constant mechanical failures mainly in the

gear, brake, compactor and transmission.    Since 1991, a total of 88 trucks were purchased;

however,  currently  there  are  only  41  trucks  that  can  be  used  and  out  of  these  41,  only  15

trucks  were  operational  during  our  mission  trip.    The  remaining  trucks  were  in  the  shop

waiting  for  replacements  and  minor  repairs.    Some  trucks  were  completely  unusable  and

some  were  outside  the  shop  being  worked  on  for  major  repairs  by  outsourced  private

companies.    The  percentage  of  operating  trucks  was  far  below  50%  while  in  Korea,  the

percentage of operating trucks was maintained to levels above 85% at all times.    Table II-6

shows the defect ratio of equipment.

The other major problem is in the road infrastructure of Barbados where a lot of the roads

are  narrow  and  hard  to  access  by  waste  collection  trucks.    There  are  a  lot  of  roads  with

dead-ends and no turn-around points; thereby, forcing waste collection trucks to back into the

dead-end roads for pickup or make hard almost impossible turns to drive out of roads.    Low

hanging  trees  or  electric  wires  also  pose  problems  to  drivers  and  parked  cars  sometimes

make it impossible to reach houses in streets with narrow roads.    Other problems that arise

are  that  sometimes  persons  dump  their  waste  into  other  person’s  garbage  lots  or  skips  in

order  to  avoid  payment  for  excessive  discharge.    Table  II-7  shows  the  troublesome  issues

related to waste collection.

III.  Case Study on Korea’s Experiences

### 1.  Korean Waste Management Laws and Policies

##### 1.1. Development of the Waste Regulations

The Waste Management Policy of Korea which started with the ‘Garbage Cleaning Law’

of  the  1960s  has  developed  continuously  through  the  establishment  and  amendment  of  the

related  laws  and  regulations.    There  was  a  dual  waste  management  policy  before  1986

because residential waste was managed under the ‘Garbage Cleaning  Law’ while industrial

waste was managed under the ‘Environmental Protection Law’.

It  is  difficult  to  say  that  both  the  ‘Garbage  Cleaning  Law’  and  the  ‘Environmental

Protection Law’ can be considered real waste management policies, as they only pertained to

the  cleaning  and  disposing  of  the  wastes  instead  of  managing  them  effectively  and

systematically.

However,  with  the  establishment  of  the  ‘Waste  Management  Law’  in  the  late  1980s,

waste  management  became  a  single  policy,  and  various  waste  management  policies  and

regulations were established and implemented afterwards.

######### 1)  Establishment of the ‘Garbage Cleaning Law’ (1961~1986)

Established in December 1961 and abolished in December 1986, the ‘Garbage Cleaning

Law’  focused  mainly  on  thoroughly  collecting  and  disposing  of  household  garbage  and

human excrements in the cities.    This was closely related to the social situation at the time

where  the  neglected  garbage  and  excrements  damaged  the  views  of  the  residential

environments and public spaces, and the odors became a serious problem.    Meanwhile, the

‘Garbage  Cleaning  Law’  was  amended in  1973  to include  not  only  household  garbage  and

human excrements but other wastes as well.

27

2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)

2)  Establishment of the ‘Environmental Protection Law’ (1978~1986)

As  the  result  of  the  increasing  awareness  for  environmental  contamination  problems  as

the  result  of  the  increase  in  industrial  wastes  from  industrialization,  the  ‘Environmental

Protection Law’ was established in December 1977 and enforced in January 1978.    With the

implementation  of  this  law,  the  waste  management  policy  in  Korea  became  a  dual  policy

where  residential  wastes  such  as  garbage  and  human  excrements  were  managed  under  the

existing ‘Garbage Cleaning Law’, while the industrial wastes were managed under the new

‘Environmental Protection Law’.

Meanwhile,  with  the  birth  of  the  Korea  Environmental  Office  in  1980  after  the

establishment  of  the  ‘Environmental  Protection  Law’,  Korea’s  environmental  policies

became  more  assertive.    In  other  words,  if  the  existing  policies  were  considered  more

passive  by  focusing  mainly  on  disposing  (cleaning)  the  wastes  that  were  produced  by

households  and  industries,  the  policies  after  the  establishment  of  the  Environmental

Protection  Law  became  more  assertive,  seeking  for  directions  to  maintain  a  clean

environment.

Furthermore,  in  order  to  reflect  the  social  situation  of  increasing  importance  for

environmental  problems,  the  Environmental  Protection  Law  included  more  assertive

solutions such as the evaluation on the pollutants’ effect on environment, the environmental

standards  and  contaminant  levels  for  pollutants  instead  of  preventing  and  improving  the

environmental pollutions.

######### 3)  The ‘Waste Management Law’ Era (1986~1992)

‘Waste  Management  Law’  was  established  in  December  1986  to  address  the  problems

that  were  caused  due  to  continuous  increase  of  waste  generation  and  the  rising  public

awareness for the safe treatment and proper management of waste in Korea. Korea’s waste

management  policy  really  developed  with  the  establishment  of  the  “Waste  Management

Law”.    Under  the  new  ‘Waste  Management  Law’,  the  dual  policy  of  ‘Garbage  Cleaning

Law’  (residential  waste)  and  ‘Environmental  Protection  Law’  (industrial  waste)  became  a

single  policy,  and  the  concept  of  ‘waste  recycling’  was  included  to  accommodate  the

awareness in and the interest to practice recycling.

28

2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)

Then in 1991, a newly amended ‘Waste Management Law’ was publically announced to

include  such  policies  as  waste  reduction  and  recycling,  waste  collection  and  disposal

deposits, follow-up management of the waste disposal facilitie.    This was closely related to

the  need  at  that  time  for  a  policy  that  went  beyond  the  simple  waste  disposal/cleaning

concept to systematically and efficiently managing the waste from the production, collection,

transportation, incineration, landfill and recycling stages (Hyung-Gi Ahn, 2010).

######### 4)  Law Separation Era (1993~present)

Since  1993  until  now,  the  unified  Waste  Management  Law  was  segmented  and

revitalized  into  recycling  and  resource  recirculation  as  well  as  actively  promoting  the

installation  of  waste  disposal  facilities  by  incorporating  a  variety  of  laws  and  regulations.

In  this  regard,  the  ‘Resource  Saving  and  Recycling  Law’  was  established  in  1992  and

enforced  from  1993.    This  law  separated  waste  reduction  and  recycling  from  the  existing

‘Waste  Management  Law’  in  order  to  promote  recycling.    Accordingly,  the  recycling

policies  and  regulations  such  as  reduction  of  packing  materials,  regulations  on  disposable

products, waste disposal deposits and fees, and encouragement of recycling industries were

enforced.

Additionally,  the  ‘International  Waste  Transport  and  Disposal  Law’  was  established  in

1992 and enforced from 1994 to fulfill the Basel Treaty.    Accordingly, the ‘Waste Disposal

Facility  Installation  and  Local  Support  Law’  was  separated  from  the  ‘Waste  Management

Law’  in  1995.    The  purpose  of  this  law  is  to  prevent  the  NIMBY  (Not  In  My  Backyard)

situation towards waste facilities such as incinerators by the local residents by giving them

support to solve and mediate any social complications that may arise.

Laws  for  specific  wastes  were  established  in  2003  and  2007.    These  included  the

‘Construction  Waste  Recycling  Law’  of  2003  and  the  ‘Electric  Appliances,  Electronic

Products,  and  Automobile  Resources  Recirculation  Law’  of  2007.    In  particular,  the

‘Electric  and  Electronic  Products,  and  Automobiles  Resource  Recirculation  Law’  was

introduced  for  the  resource  recirculation  concept  and  the  product  resource  recirculation

evaluation.

Meanwhile,  the  ‘Standardized  Garbage  Bag  System’  and  the  ‘Forbidding  of  Food

Garbage  Accumulation  and  Landfill  Ban’  were  enforced  in  1995  and  2005  respectively  to

reduce waste, promote separate collection through recycling, and recover resources.

1.2. Main Waste Laws

The  main  waste  laws  of  Korea  began  with  the  ‘Waste  Management  Law’  in  1986  and

developed  through  the  ‘Resource  Saving  and  Recycling  Law’  and  the  ‘International  Waste

Transport  and  Disposal  Law’  in  1994,  the  ‘Waste  Disposal  Facility  Installation  and  Local

Support  Law’  in  1995,  and  then  the  ‘Electric  Appliances,  Electronic  Products,  and

Automobile Resources Recirculation Law’ in 2007.

With  the  amendment  of  the  'Waste  Management  Law'  in  1995,  waste  was  divided  into

residential  waste  and  commercial  waste.    The  'Waste  Management  Law’  was  amended  in

2007 to introduce the ‘Electronic Transfer and Takeover System’, and made it obligatory to

30

2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)

report the details of the wastes in order to strengthen and simplify the management process,

and  make  it  transparent.    Accordingly,  each  time a  business  produces,  collects,  transports,

recycles or disposes of wastes, all data relating to the transfer and takeover of the process has

to be inputted in the electronic information processing program.    Furthermore, if a business

exports or imports wastes, information such as type, quantity, and disposal plans have to be

reported  to  the  Minister  of  Environment.    Therefore,  if  one  type  of  waste  is  imported  or

exported, the type, quantity, and disposal plans of the concerned waste must be reported to

the Minister of Environment.

The 'Waste Management Law' was amended again recently and publically announced in

July  2015,  to  be  enforced  in  July  2016.    The  main  purpose  of  the  amendment  was  to

manage  the  waste  systematically  and  activate  the  recycling  to  develop  the  concerned

industries and technologies.    The main amendment of the 'Waste Management Law' is the

systematic  management  of  the  wastes  depending  on  the  source,  composition,  and  toxicity,

while promoting the development of the new waste recycling technologies.

In  order  for  a  smooth  enforcement  of  this  amended  law,  the  Ministry  of  Environment

established  guidelines  for  a  more  detailed  waste  classification,  advanced  and  improved

recycle  management  structure,  and  recycling  environment  evaluation,  and  plans  to  do

maintenance on the enforcement ordinances and regulations.

##### 1.3. Waste Management Plan

###### 1.3.1.  Comprehensive National Waste Management Plan

In 1993, the Ministry of Environment established the ‘Comprehensive National Waste

Management  Plan  (1993~1995)’.    As  the  result  of  this  plan,  the  ‘Resource  Saving  and

Recycling Law’ was enforced (1993), the ‘Waste Disposal Facility Installation and Local

Support  Law’  was  established  (1995),  and  the  ‘Standardized  Garbage  Bag  System’  was

implemented (1995).

However, this plan was amended due to the numerous internal and external changes

which had an effect on the waste management conditions and policies.    Two reasons for

31

2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)

this  are  the  ‘Standardized  Garbage  Bag  System’  and  the  global  environmental  change.

First of all, for one year after the initial implementation of the ‘Standardized Garbage Bag

System’ in January 1995, residential waste was reduced by 27% and recycling increased

by  35%,  bringing  about  the  need  for  a  waste  management  plan  to  respond  to  this.

Furthermore,  there  was  also  the  need  for  change  in  the  central  government’s  policies

towards the local governments who were closing themselves off after the election of the

local government heads.

Globally,  there  was  reorganization  in  the  world  order  of  gradual  integration  of

environment and economy with the World Trade Organization (WTO) at the center, and

Korea saw increasing need to change its environment.    Additionally, as the result of the

1972  London  Treaty  on  the  prevention  of  ocean  pollution  from  disposal  of  wastes  and

other matters, Korea had increasing need for new measures in preparation for the ocean

disposed waste ban in the near future.

Therefore, the Ministry of Environment amended the ‘Comprehensive National Waste

Plan’  which  was  established  under  the  policy  goal  of  ‘building  an  infrastructure  for  the

resource recirculation economy’ as the basic plan on waste management, and established
######## the ‘1st Comprehensive National Waste Management Plan (1996~2001)’.    Then the ‘2nd

Comprehensive National Waste Management Plan (2002~2011)’ was confirmed in March

2003 to fixate the policy goal of a resource recirculation waste management system where

the  first  plan  was  developed  further  to  reduce  the  total  quantity  of  the  wastes,  recover

resources  and  recycle  as  much  as  possible,  and  dispose  of  inevitable  wastes  in  an  eco-
######## friendly,  safe  and  hygienic  way.    ‘The  3rd  Comprehensive  National  Waste  Management

Plan’ is currently being finalized.

######## The policy goal of the 1st Plan was ‘establishing a sustainable resource recirculation

economy infrastructure’ and three main focus areas were selected to achieve the goal of

promoting  resource  recovery  to  protect  nature  and  providing  the  citizens  with  a  more

pleasant living environment.    The three focus areas are:

#########   Waste  Minimization.    Efforts  would  be  made  to  develop  policies  in  stages  to

minimize the production, distribution and consumption of the wastes during the entire

life cycle of a product.

#########   Resource  Recovery.    An  integrated  recycling  system  would  be  constructed  to

32

2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)

promote  resource  recovery  and  increase  the  efficiency  of  the  waste  resource

distribution.

#########   Safe  Waste  Management.    A  plan  is  needed  to  find  ways  to  prevent  environmental

pollution and effectively manage harmful wastes.

######## Additionally,  the  1st  plan  presented  five  main  strategies  for  clarifying  the  roles  and

responsibilities  of  each  economic  group,  integration  and  efficiency  of  the  waste

management  system,  minimization  of  wastes  at  each  stage  of  a  product’s  life  cycle,

promotion  of  regional  competitiveness  based  on  the  characteristics  of  that  region,

encouragement  for  more  public  participation  and  establishment  of  a  ‘Green  Spending’

culture.

With  the  goal  of  achieving  a  sustainable  resource  recovery  society  or  a  Zero  Waste
######## Society, the ‘2nd Comprehensive National Waste Management Plan (2002~2011, amended

in 2007)’ presented six strategies.    “Zero Waste” or “Zero Discharge Waste” defined as a

state where zero waste is incinerated or buried but 100% of the waste is either re-used or

recycled.    It  is  an  ideal  or  theoretical  state  only  and  almost  impossible  to  achieve  in

reality.  The  six  strategies  are  waste  risk  management,  waste  resource  recovery,  waste

reduction,  waste  disposal  facility  installation  and  advanced  management,  waste

management  internationalization  and  cultivation  of  the  recycling  industry,  and  the

construction of a customer-oriented waste management system.

######## The ‘3rd Comprehensive National Waste Management Plan (2012~2021)’ is currently

being finalized to include the construction of a competitive system by regions, technology

development to promote waste recycling, and conduction of a national statistical study on

wastes.

###### 1.3.2.  Basic Resource Circulation Plan

######## The  In  2011,  the  Ministry  of  Environment  established  the  ‘1st  Basic  Resource

Recirculation  Plan  (2011~2015)’  to  build  an  upcycling  basis  for  waste  resources  in

accordance with the ‘Resource Saving and Recycling Law’ with the objective of realizing

the  ‘Low  Carbon  Resource  Recirculation  Society’.    ‘Upcycling’  is  changing  the  wastes

into  a  new  material  or  product  that  is  higher  in  value  qualitatively  or  environmentally

(Ministry  of  Environment,  2015).    Accordingly,  all  wastes  are  considered  upcycle-able

33

2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)

resources, that is to say, they can be recirculated 100%, and such acknowledgement is the

basic precondition for the realization of the low carbon recirculation society (Ministry of

Environment, 2015).

This  plan  which  contains  five  strategies,  was  established  together  with  the  various

Korean  ministries  such  as  the  Ministry  of  Public  Administration  and  Security,  Ministry

for Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Ministry of Knowledge Economy, and the

Ministry of Land, and Transport and Maritime Affairs.    The five strategies are changing

to  a  resource  recirculation  society  structure,  realizing  an  improved  value  resource

recirculation  (4Rs:  reduce,  reuse,  recycle,  recover  energy),  building  an  integrated  waste

disposal  infrastructure,  cultivating  the  resource  recirculation  industry  and  technology

development,  and  providing  the  basis  for  implementation  such  as  a  national  resource

recirculation evaluation.

Meanwhile, this plan serves as the guideline for promoting government-wide resource

recirculation  to  present  the  concerned  governmental  ministries  with  mid  and  long  term

goals and strategies for waste resource upcycling and green growth.

##### 1.4. Waste Management System

###### 1.4.1.  Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)

The main ‘Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)’ was enforced in January 2003 in

accordance with the amended ‘Resource Saving and Recycling Law’.    The goal of EPR

is to strengthen the responsibilities of the waste producers to reduce wastes and promote

recycling by inducing eco-friendly ways in all stages of waste management from product

design, manufacturing, distribution, consumption, to disposal.

In  accordance  with  this  system,  the  producers  have  to  fulfill  their  responsibilities

depending on the number of product deliveries they receive and the obligatory quantity by

products  annually  announced  by  the  government.    Those  producers  who  do  not  fulfill

their  obligations  are  charged  the  ‘recycle  tax’  which  is  less  than  1.3  times  the  cost  to

collect and recycle a product.    The producers are also required to pay an allotted fee to

the Recycle Business Co-operative.

Meanwhile, the fulfilling of the obligatory recycling amount can be executed in either

of three methods.    The first method is for the producer to recycle them himself, and the

second  method  is  for  the  producer  to  hire  a  recycling  company  for  the  job.    The  third

method  is  for  the  producer  to  join  the  Recycling  Business  Co-operative  and  pay  the

allotted fee.    If a producer chooses to fulfill the recycling obligation using either the first

or the second method, then there is an incentive given to the producer where a deduction

is provided for the amount of payment of the allotted fee.    The amount of deduction is

proportional to the recycling amount multiplied by a deduction factor determined by the

Ministy of Environment.

###### 1.4.2.  Standard Garbage Bag System

The ‘Standard Garbage Bag System’ was enforced in January 1995.    The targets for

this system are household garbage and wastes from small businesses that have the similar

composition to the recyclable residential wastes.

This is a system where the waste producer pays a fee for the wastes they throw out,

thus  reducing  waste  and  increasing  recycling.    The  fee  is  collected  through  the  sale  of

special  garbage  bags  or  stickers  designated  by  each  local  government  for  the  wastes.

Accordingly,  the  levying  of  the  garbage  fee  changed  from  a  fixed  amount  based  on

property tax or building area, to be proportional to the waste output (through usage of the

‘standard garbage bags’).

35

2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)

According  to  this  system,  waste  has  to  be  disposed  of  at  a  specific  area  using  the

standardized  garbage  bags  but  if  these  special  bags  are  not  used  and  the  offender  is

identified,  a  fine  of  less  than  1  million  won  (U$850)  is  charged.    However,  the

standardized  garbage  bags  are  not  required  and  collected  free  of  charge  for  recyclable

wastes if they are disposed of in accordance with the guidelines of the local governments.

For  those  large  wastes  that  cannot  be  disposed  of  in  the  standardized  garbage  bags,

households need to be call the local district office and ask for removal of the waste with

some payment.    The payment amount and an invoice is issued by the local district office

and  the  households  need to  go  to any  bank  to  make  the  payment  (invoice  is  needed  for

payment).

###### 1.4.3.  Sharing Expenses System

The ‘Sharing Expense System’ was introduced in 1993 to suppress the production of

wastes from the product manufacturing stages as well as to prevent waste.    This system

charges  a  waste  disposal  fee  to  the  manufacturer  or  importer  of  products,  supplies  or

containers that contain harmful materials or are difficult to recycle, causing problems in

waste  management.    These  products  include  containers  for  insecticides  and  hazardous

products, antifreeze, gum, disposable diapers, cigarettes, and plastics.

The  “sharing  expense  fee”  is  included  in  the  special  accounts  for  environmental

improvement and used for the promotion and activation of recycling.    The purpose of the

fee is to purchase and store recyclable resources, support recycling businesses and install

waste  disposal  facilities,  research  and  develop  technologies  to  effectively  recycle  and

reduce wastes, and support the local governments in the collection and recycling costs of

the wastes.

##### 1.5. Summary and Implications

In  reviewing  the  development  trends  of  Korea’s  waste  management  policies  based  on

the contents discussed, it is apparent that as time went on, development took place in Korea

in  the  order  of  ‘garbage  cleaning  -  waste  reduction  -  safe  handling  of  wastes  and  waste

management  reinforcement  -  recycling  and  resource  recirculation’.    In  other  words,  from

cleaning or reducing wastes, the policies gradually progressed and developed into efficiently

36

2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)

and  effectively  managing  and  using  recyclable  wastes,  to  improving  the  usage  value  or

adding new value to the wastes as if the wastes were also resources as well.

In the past before the industrialization era, when Korea’s main concern was ‘how not to

go  hungry’  and  livelihood  was  the  most  important  thing  for  the  people,  residential  wastes

were almost neglected.    However, with the continuous increase in population and livelihood

activities  became  more  vigorous,  the  wastes  produced  also  grew  drastically  and  the

previously neglected wastes not only damaged the views of the residential environments but

also public spaces such as roads as well, while the serious odors became an important social

issue.    Hence, the ‘Garbage Cleaning Law’ was established in 1961 to dispose the wastes to

provide a pleasant living environment, becoming the starting point for waste disposal.

However,  with  the  increase  of  industrial  wastes  resulting  from  industrialization  which

was  taking  place  in  the  late  1970s,  industrial  wastes  became  a  separate  category  under  the

‘Environmental Protection Law’ of 1977.    In addition, with the increasing wastes resulting

from industrialization leading to environmental pollution problems, and the rise in awareness

of  the  importance  in  environmental  protection,  political  weight  began  to  move  from  just

cleaning  up  the  garbage  to  slowly  reducing  the  amount  of  waste  to  fundamentally  and

actively solving the waste issues and seeking ways to protect the environment.

Through the establishment of the ‘Waste Management Law’ in the late 1980s, the waste

management  policy  entered  a  full-scale  progressive  stage.    With  the  importance  of  safe

treatment and reinforcement of waste management becoming more apparent as the result of

the  continuously  increasing  wastes,  policies  for  residential  wastes  and  industrial  wastes

integrated as one comprehensive structure.    Furthermore, a new concept of ‘recycling’ was

introduced  in  the  ‘Waste  Management  Law’  by  changing  the  thinking  of  wastes  as  simply

being ‘useless garbage that need to be removed’ to ‘materials that can be used again’.    This

thought  process  became  the  starting  point  for  drawing  up  a  policy  to  systematically  and

efficiently  manage  all  the  stages  of  waste  management  from  waste  production,  collection,

transportation, incineration, landfill and recycling.

37

2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)

Figure III-1 | Development Trends of Korea’s Waste Management Policies

Meanwhile, the waste management policy from the 1990s until the present has focused

on  increasing  not  only  recycling  based  on  the  ‘Resource  Saving  and  Recycling  Law’,  the

‘Electric  Appliances,  Electronic  Products,  and  Automobile  Resources  Recirculation  Law’,

and the ‘Standardized Garbage Bag System’, but also on building a ‘Low Carbon Resource

Recirculation  Society’  through  ‘Waste  Upcycling’.    It  can  be  said  that  the  increasing

awareness on the importance of environmental protection within Korea had a large impact on

such trend, but the global trend of focusing on national competitiveness and world order as

well as ‘environment’ and ‘economy’ centering around the World Trade Organization (WTO)

also had a considerable affect.

‘Waste  Upcycling’  is  one  step  further  in  development  beyond  ‘waste  recycling’.    In

other words, it is adding a new design or process to a waste to add value qualitatively and

environmentally and recreating a new material or product.    When waste upcycling actively

takes place, not only will waste reduction and recycling be achieved, but also will secure the

necessary resources to manufacture a new product effectively from the point of view of costs

38

and  productivity.    Furthermore,  new  industries  can  be  created  and  developed  centering  on

waste upcycling.

In order for these effects to be actually displayed, there is a need for a policy to back up
######## the waste upcycling.    Accordingly, it will be interesting to see the outcomes of the ‘1st Basic

Resource Recirculation Plan (2011~2015)’ established by the Korean government in 2011 by

emphasizing  the  importance  of  waste  resource  upcycling  and  the  follow  up  policies

developed afterwards.    Also, during the follow up policy establishment processes, it will be

important  to  seriously  consider  the  efficient  management  of  the  wastes  as  well  as  the

upcycling  technologies  and  policies  supporting  product  development,  bearing  in  mind  the

upcycling process itself.

##### 1.6. Comparison  of

the  Waste  Management  Policy

for

Barbados and Korea

The waste management policy of Korea started with the ‘Garbage Cleaning Law’ in 1961

to clean up the garbage of the cities, and influenced by industrialization, the ‘Environmental

Protection Law’ was enforced in 1978 to manage the industrial wastes, looking for ways to

actively  improve  the  environmental  pollution.    Additionally,  with  the  enforcement  of  the

‘Waste Management Law’ in 1986 to efficiently manage the increasing wastes, the ‘Garbage

Cleaning Law’ and the ‘Environmental Protection Law’ were integrated into one.

‘The  Health  Services  Act  (law  to  promote  and  preserve  health)’  of  Barbados  started  to

manage the wastes in 1969, and with the gradual increase in population and development of

the  tourism  industry,  the  ‘Integrated  Solid  Waste  Management  Programme  (ISWMP)’  was

enforced in 1993 to improve Barbados’s weak area of solid wastes.

Both  Korea  and  Barbados  integrated  the  relevant  waste  policies  in  1986  and  1993

respectively in order to efficiently manage the wastes, but Korea opens the ‘Law Separation

Era’ in 1993 by establishing separate laws for each waste product.    That is to say, the focus

of  Korea’s  waste  management  policy  is  in  suppressing  the  production  of  wastes  and

promoting resource recirculation through recycling, and thus various waste systems that were

previously  regulated  by  the  traditional  Waste  Management  Law  were  separated  into  the

Resource Recycling Law and the Individual Recycling Law (Chae, 2009).

39

2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)

Korea currently not only has policies to increase waste recycling, but also established the

‘1st  Basic  Resource  Recirculation  Plan  (2011~2015)’  to  realize the  ‘Low  Carbon  Resource

Recirculation  Society’.    In  order  to  achieve  the  low  carbon  resource  recirculation  society,

the policy makers in Korea are aware that all wastes are resources that can be upcycled 100%.

Barbados also has established the ‘Barbados Sustainable Development Policy (BSDP)’ and

‘The  National  Strategic  Plan  of  Barbados  2005~2015)'  to  establish  the  basic  principles  for

sustainable development.

Both  Korea  and  Barbados  have  developed  policies  and  legal  structures  for  solid  waste

management differently in accordance with the social, cultural, economic, and geographical

environments of each country.    If Korea strengthens the legal system of the necessary areas

through  segmentation  of  Korea’s  relatively  multi-complex  industrial  structure,  various

international  stakeholders  and  rapid  growth,  Barbados  has  a  relatively  simple  industrial

structure to manage the solid wastes integrally.    However, both countries are striving for a

resource recycling and resource recirculation society for sustainable development.

### 2.  General Status of Waste in Korea

##### 2.1. Definition and Classification of Waste

In Under Article 2 of the “Waste Management Law”, waste is defined as ‘materials that

are no longer needed in people’s lives or business  activities’.    Also, residential wastes are

wastes  other  than  the  business  wastes,  while  business  wastes  are  wastes  produced  by  air,

water  quality,  noise  and  vibration  discharging  facilities  and  businesses  designated  by  the

presidential decree.    Designated wastes are those such as waste oil and waste acid that can

pollute  the  surrounding  environments  or  those  that  can  be  harmful  to  the  body  such  as

medical wastes and determined by the presidential decree.

40

2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)

Figure III-2 | Classification Structure

The  classification  of  the  wastes  can  be  categorized  largely  into  residential  wastes  and

workplace wastes, where residential wastes are those other than the workplace wastes, and

workplace wastes can be classified into three types – general workplace wastes, construction

wastes, and designated wastes.    Here, general workplace wastes are classified as workplace

wastes  and  discharging  facilities  wastes,  and  designated  wastes  are  classified  as  medical

wastes  and  designated  wastes  other  than  the  medical  wastes.    In  other  words,  workplace

wastes  are  those  that  are  discharged  more  than  300kg  per  day  or  more  than  5  tons  as  the

result  of  a  series  of  constructions  or  work  (excluding  construction  companies),  and

discharging  facilities  wastes  are  wastes  produced  by  air,  water  quality,  noise  and  vibration

discharging facilities, end waste water treatment facilities, public sewage treatment facilities,

human excretion treatment facilities, public animal excrement treatment facilities, and waste

disposal facilities.    Construction wastes are wastes from construction companies producing

more than 5 tons from construction work.

##### 2.2. Waste Generation and Disposal

####### 2.2.1.  Waste Generation

Under the “Waste Controls Act” the Korean government conducts research every

year  to  determine  the  source  of  the  produced  wastes,  types  and  principal  treatment

agents,  treatment  methods,  and  treatment  status,  and  a  national  statistical  waste

41

2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)

research every five years to use as the basic data for policy establishment.

Waste quantities from 1999 until 2012 continued to increase starting in 1999 from

219,217 tons/day, and increasing close to twice the amount in 2012 at 394,510 tons/day.

Looking  at  the  compositions,  there  was  no  big  change  in  the  residential  wastes  and

designated wastes, but the composition of the general workplace wastes increased by

about  1.4  times,  while  construction  wastes  increased  by  approximately  3  times.

When looking at the waste status ratio in 2013, construction waste was approximately

47%, general workplace wastes was 37%, residential wastes was 12%, and designated

waste was about 3%.

#### Figure III-3 | Waste Generation for the last 15 years

Source: KMOE. (2015). 2014 Environmental White Paper. KMOE

In looking at the composition of the residential wastes based on the 2013 results,

combustible was largest with 18,420 tons/day (38%), recyclable was 13,935 tons/day

(28%), food was 12,501 tons/day (26%), and incombustible was 3,872 tons/day (8%).

###### 2.2.2.  Waste Disposal

Looking at the residential wastes by disposal methods for 1999, out of the total of

45,614  tons/day,  landfill  was  largest  with  52%,  incineration  was  38%,  recycling  was

lowest  with  10%,  but  in  2012,  out  of  the  total  residential  waste  of  48,990  tons/day,

landfill was rapidly reduced to 16%, and recycling rapidly increased with 59%.    From

2005, with the ban of burying  food wastes and waste separation expanded, recycling

increased while influencing the reduction of incineration and landfill.

As the result of the standardized garbage bag system, recycling policy, and waste

resource energy conversion implemented from 2000, Korea’s waste disposal structure

is changing  from a simple landfill-oriented system to a resource recirculation system

that prioritizes the recirculation of waste resources.

##### 2.3. Waste Disposal Companies and Facilities

####### 2.3.1.  Waste Disposal Companies

If a waste is disposed or recycled in Korea, permission is required under the ‘Waste

Controls  Act’.    The  waste  disposal  business  can  be  categorized  into  collection  and

transport, middle  disposal,  final  disposal,  and  recycling.    For  the  construction  waste

disposal companies, they need permission for the middle disposal process.    There are

a  total  of  12,534  approved  waste  disposal  companies  comprising  of  6,573  collection

and transport companies, 262 middle disposal companies, 55 final disposal companies,

5,146 recycling companies, and 498 middle processing (construction waste) companies.

“Middle  disposal”  and  “middle  processing”  companies  are  categories  only  used  in

Korea  which  refers  to  companies  performing  incomplete  processing  such  as  simple

shredding, sorting, chemical treatment, etc.

###### 2.3.2.  Waste Disposal Facilities

The waste disposal facilities built and operated by the local governments in Korea

are landfills, incineration facilities, food waste recycling facilities, recycling selection

facilities,  and  solid  fuel  product  manufacturing  facilities.    There  are  a  total  of  690

facilities  comprising  of  233  landfills,  184  incineration  facilities,  53  food  waste

facilities, 66 recycling selection facilities, and 164 others.

3.  Case Studies in Korea

##### 3.1. Automatic Pipeline Transport System

In the general case, residential waste are placed in standard garbage bags and discharged

in pre-specified locations near the house for curb side service.    The main problems for this

general process is odor, unpleasant view, flies and other insects, cats which are major causes

of  claims  by  residents  in  the  area.    A  new  process  and  system  is  currently  being

implemented  in  a  few  areas  in  Seoul  such  as  the  Eunpyung  region  where  an  Automatic

Pipeline  Transport  System  (APTS)  is  constructed  and  being  used  to  solve  the  above

mentioned problems.    Test cases were started in 1990 and now in 2015, newly constructed

apartment complexes all are equipped with the APTS.

The  Figure  below  show  the  conceptual  idea  behind  the  APTS  where  residents  in  the

apartment complexes would bring their residential waste to fixed location trash bin and using

their pre-assigned RFID cards, residents would open the trash bins with their RFID cards and

deposit their waste in the bins.    The bins are directly connected to nearby incineration plants

via an underground (or above ground) pipelines which uses vacuum suction to automatically

transport the deposited waste to the incineration plant where the waste are burned for energy.

The APTS eliminates the need for collection trucks and residents can discharge waste at any

time of the week without delay.

##### 3.2. Allbaro System

Up  to  the  year  2000,  all  data  related  to  waste  collection  and  disposal  were  manually

recorded  and  stored.    The  collection  companies  recorded  collection  activities  using  daily

work sheets and disposal companies recorded all disposal activities using a daily log.    The

manual process was inefficient in using unnecessary time, manpower and effort to perform

tasks that could were menial and labor extensive.

In 2001, a computer system called “Allbaro” was implemented in order to automate the

data collection, storage, and retrieval process associated with waste collection and disposal

data.    All  collection  companies,  transportation  companies,  transfer  stations,  disposal

companies  would  input  daily  collection,  transportation  and  disposal  data  into  the  Allbaro

system online where all waste related data was managed centrally which could be accessed

and shared by all stakeholders.    Allbaro is the only automatic waste management system in

the  world  that  is  used  by  all  stakeholders  throughout  the  whole  nation.    Currently,  over

350,000  companies  and  organizations  are  using  the  system  and every  year  over  10  million

data  activities  are  processed  by  the  system.    The  system  keeps  track  of  over  128  million

tons of waste each year.

##### 3.3. Medical Waste RFID System

In  20015,  in  order  to  properly  monitor  and  manage  medical  waste  which  might  be

hazardous  or  contagious,  the  Ministry  of  Environment  issued  standardized  plastic  bins

specifically for the storage and transport of medical waste.    These plastic bins were tagged

using RFID tags in order to track the progress of the waste from the initial discharge to the

final disposal.

#### Figure III-9 | Plastic bins for medical waste with RFID tags

3.4. Use of GPS-based System for Budgeting Purposes

In Korea, almost all the collection and transport activities are outsourced to private waste

haulers and in order to accurately determine the necessary budget to contract with the private

companies,  the  local  governments  estimates  the  following  parameters  needed  for  the

collection  and  transport  activities:  1)  cost  of  manpower,  2)  cost  of  truck  operations,  3)

operational expenses, and 4) management costs.    All the other parameters can be estimated

using past data; however, in order to estimate the cost of truck operations, we need to know

the  exact  routes  taken  by  the  trucks  in  performing  the  collection  and  transport.    A  GPS-

based  tracking  system  can  be  used  to  monitor  and  track  the  actual  routes  of  the  collection

trucks operated by the private waste haulers.    The Figure below shows one example of such

a system used by a local government agency in Korea.

#### Figure III-10 | Example of the GPS-based Tracking System

##### 3.5. Residential Waste and Disposal

###### 3.5.1.  Separation and Disposal of Residential Waste

Residential  waste  is  separated  at  the  point  of  discharge  depending  on  the

composition  of  the  waste.    Combustible  wastes  and  incombustible  wastes  are

separated and discharged in their respective standardized garbage bags.    There are no

special criteria for recyclable wastes, but they are discharged in transparent bags that

51

2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)

make  it  easy  to  confirm  the  contents  inside  the  transparent  bags.    Large  garbage  is

classified as used furniture and used household appliances, where stickers have to be

purchased at the local district offices and put on the discharged furniture before they

can  be  collected,  while  the  discharged  household  appliances  are  collected  free  of

charge if they are properly reported to the local district office.

###### 3.5.2.  Types  of  Trucks  for  the  Collection  and  Transportation  of

####### Residential Wastes

The trucks for collecting and transporting of residential wastes differ depending on

the  type  of  garbage.    Combustible  wastes  are  generally  transported  by  compressor

trucks, and if the distance between the collection site and disposal depot is far, they are

sometimes  transferred  to  an  “arm-roll”  truck  at  a  transfer  station  and  before  being

transported to the disposal depot.

#### Figure III-11 | Types fo Trucks

Food  wastes  are  transported  with  tank-lorries  made  exclusively  for  this  purpose

and  these  trucks  are  equipped  with  mechanical  devices  on  the  front  or  side  of  the

trucks  to  load  the  special  food  waste  containers.    Recyclable  wastes  are  mostly

transported in cargo trucks that can unload in ‘dumping’ style.    These trucks usually

have high sides and an open-top.    However, the recent trend for the recyclable waste

trucks  is  renovating  them  by  closing  off  the  top  for  safety  and  for  environmental

reasons.    Bulky  wastes,  such  as  used  household  appliances,  are  transported  with

52

2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)

“Wing-Body” trucks that open sideways or topside, while cargo trucks with open tops

are used for furniture.

###### 3.5.3.  Residential Waste Disposal Methods

In general, residential wastes are disposed of by incineration, landfill, re-utilization

or recycling.    There are currently approximately 500 incineration facilities in Korea,

where most of the medium and large incineration facilities recycle the heat to produce

hot  water  or  electricity  (waste-to-energy  plants).    The  incineration  facilities  are

managed in accordance with the installation, management, and inspection standards of

the Waste Management Law, and the emitted gas is managed strictly by the air quality

standards of the Law.    The Stoker-type incinerators are mostly used in Korea because

of their efficiency and proven technology.    However, various other types such as the

Fluidized  Bed,  Rotary  Kiln,  Gasification,  and  Plasma  were  all  considered  with  few

currently in operation.

There  are  about  290  landfills  in  Korea,  where  220  are  public  facilities.    The

landfill  facilities  are  operated  in  accordance  with  the  installation,  maintenance  and

follow-up  standards  for  dikes,  shield  skirts,  leachate  treatment  sites,  underground

water  control,  gas  pileup  facilities,  etc.  accordance  to  the  Waste  Management  Law.

The largest landfill is the Metropolitan Landfill which is in the vicinity of  Seoul and

handles the wastes generated in Seoul, Incheon and the Gyeonggi Province.

Food wastes are mostly handled by the three facilities comprised of the Compost

Facility,  the  Fodder  Facility,  and  the  Anaerobic  Digestion  Facility.    With  the

establishment  of  the  Landfill  Prohibition  Law  in  2005,  the  food  waste  treatment

facilities  increased  to  280  nationwide,  and  they  are  being  managed  by  the  Waste

Management Law together with the incineration facilities and the landfills.

Recyclable wastes consist of glass bottles, metal cans, plastics, papers, vinyls, and

styrofoams  that  can  be  reused  or  recycled.    They  are  transported  to  the  recyclables

sorting  facility  in  their  mixed  state  at  the  time  of  the  collections,  and  then  separated

into various materials by people or machines.    There are some 200 public and private

sorting facilities in Korea, and the separated materials are then auctioned and sold to

various recycling companies.

53

2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)

The SRF (Solid Refuse Fuel) Facility is an energy recovering facility that emerged

as  the  substitute  for  the  incineration  facilities.    SRF  is  also  called  the  RDF  (Refuse

Derived Fuel) in the past.    The SRF Facility produces solid refuse fuel in ‘pellet’ or

‘fluff’  form  by  crushing,  grinding,  drying  and  shaping  the  combustible  wastes,  and

these  wastes  are  used  as  natural  fuels  in  cogeneration  plants,  cement  kilns,  and

industrial boilers after the contaminants are removed and heat is increased.

###### 3.5.4.  Residential Waste Management in the City of Seoul

######### 1)  Residential Wastes and Disposal

Seoul,  the  Capital  City  of  the  Republic  of  Korea,  has  an  area  of  605km2,  and  a

population  of  approximately  10.40  million  people.    It  is  a  large  city  with  25

administrative  districts  and  generates  an average  of  about  8,559  tons  (as  of  2012)  of

residential  wastes  daily,  with  each  person  generating  0.8kg  a  day.    With  the

Standardized  Garbage  Bag  System  implemented  in  1994,  the  residential  wastes

decreased by 40% compared to 2012, and landfill was reduced to 94%.

#### Figure III-12 | Trend in Waste Generation and Burial in Seoul

Source: Yu. (2015). Policy on Waste Management in Seoul. City of Seoul

Based on the 2012 residential wastes, general garbage was 3,078 tons (36%), food

waste was 3,072 tons (35.9%), and recyclable waste was 2,409 tons (28.1%).    From

this amount, 2,304 tons (42%) were incinerated, 774 tons (14.1%) were landfilled, and

54

2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)

5,481 tons (43.9%) were recycled, making recycling the most used method for waste

treatment.

######### 2)  Residential Waste Collection and Disposal System

Residential waste is separated into general waste and recyclable waste, and general

waste  is  collected  by  the  local  governments  and  transported  to  the  incineration

facilities  and  landfills.    There  are  five  incineration  facilities  in  Seoul,  and  only  one

landfill, the Metropolitan Landfill.    Recyclable wastes are collected by both the local

governments  and  private  recycling  waste  collection  companies.

  The

local

governments  transport  to  the  recyclables  sorting  center  where  they  are  auctioned  off

after  the  EPR  registration,  while  private  collectors  work  directly  with  the  recycling

companies.    Food  wastes  are  collected  by  the  local  governments  and  directly

contracted with recycling companies in Seoul and its vicinity.

######### 3)  Residential Waste Collection and Management Infrastructure

The  collection  and  transportation  of  residential  wastes  and  the  management  of

street sweeping for the city of Seoul are differentiated.    In the case of collecting and

transporting,  most  of  the  local  district  offices  work  independently  by  contracting  the

jobs to third parties while operating with the income from the selling of standardized

garbage  bags.    There  are  3,018  sanitation  workers  cleaning  from  19:00  until  05:00

daily.

cleaning from 05:00 until 15:00 every day.

There are a total of 1,953 trucks for collecting and transporting general household

and  food  wastes  in  Seoul.    General  wastes  are  usually  collected  by  compression

trucks, cargo trucks and “arm-roll” trucks, while food wastes are collected by specially

designed and manufactured food-waste collection trucks.

######### 3)  The Busan Eco-Friendly Energy Town

The  infrastructure  for  Busan’s  residential  waste  disposal  system  is  concentrated

around  the  Saengok  Landfill  in  Gangseo-gu,  and  the  facilities  mutually  link  together

and reuse the energy generated from the waste treating process.    The City of Busan is

currently  building  an  eco-friendly  energy  town  to  this  infrastructure  by  adding  a

Specialized Resource Recirculation Complex.

The ‘Eco-Friendly Energy Town’ is a project that will solve the environmental and

energy  problem  simultaneously  by  installing  avoiding  facilities  like  the  landfill,

sewage  treatment  plant,  and  incineration  facility  in  one  location  and  providing  the

local residents with actual benefits.    The City of Busan plans to not only provide the

residents with jobs, energy supply and improved welfare, but also expand their project

into  a  culture  and  tourism  business  to  overcome  the  general  view  of  avoiding

unpleasant facilities.

The LandFill Gas (LFG) generated from the Saengok Landfill produces 4MWh of

electricity  from  the  generator  facility  built  with  private  investment  and  records  an

57

2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)

annual  income  of  KW2  billion  ($1.7  million),  while  the  food  recycling  facility

produces  2MWh  of  electricity  from  collected  digestion  gas.    The  SRF  facility

produces SRF from 900 tons of waste daily and the boiler facility uses this to generate

24.8MVh of electricity, bringing in KW15.9 billion ($13.6 million) in profits annually.

Additionally,  the  Sewer  Sludge  Recycling  Facility,  the  Recycling  Center,  the

Recyclable  Sorting  Facility,  the  Vinyl  Recycling  Facility,  and  the  Vinyl  SRF  Facility

are  also  being  used  as  eco-friendly  facilities  to  recycle  resources  and  collect  energy,

and  the  earnings  from  the  Eco-Friendly  Energy  Town  are  being  used  for  the  local

community  after  discussions  with

the

local  resident

task  force  committee.

Furthermore, the Special Resource Recirculation Complex that is being formed as part

of  the  Governmental  Assistance  Policy  is  scheduled  to  be  completed  in  December

2015, with the hope of attracting 77 private steel scrap and waste recycling companies,

and  creating  some  3,000  jobs.    The  Complex  plans  to  build  the  foundation  for  the

recycling  industry  by  creating  a  synergy  effect  of  mutually  linked  companies  of  the

recycling industry in one concentrated area.

3.5.6.  The  Metropolitan  Landfill  and  Plans  for  the  Futuristic

####### Theme Park

######### 1)  Metropolitan Landfill Facility

The Metropolitan Landfill was formed in 1992 and located in Seo-gu, Incheon to

treat  the  residential  and  construction  wastes  generated  in  Seoul,  Incheon  and  part  of
######## the  Gyeonggi  Province.    It  has  an  area  of  15,410,000  m2 with  the  capacity  of 228

million tons.    It is comprised of four zones, with Zone 1 currently being used as a golf

course after the area was filled completely.    Zone 2 is currently in use, with Zones 3

and 4 remaining in reserve.

#### Figure III-14 | Current Status of Metroplitan Landfill

######### 2)  Eco-Friendly Metropolitan Landfill Energy Town

The  Metropolitan  Landfill  is  managed  by  the  Metropolitan  Landfill  Site

Management Corporation that was established by the Korean government to handle the

wastes from the initial two cities and one province.    In the beginning, the Corporation

was planned to manage the landfill site only, but with the change in the waste policies

and the times, it is now managing a variety of energy facilities additionally.

59

2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)

In accordance with the government’s changed policy to reduce wastes and recycle

more, the inflow of wastes to the Metropolitan Landfill was drastically reduced after

1994 from 11.7 million tons to 3.45 million tons in 2013, almost below 1/3.    Taking

into consideration the recent increase in oil prices and the basic conditions for utilizing

energy, the formation of an eco-friendly energy town was planned from the end of the

1990s.    The eco-friendly energy town was formed because there were infrastructures

for  the  new  towns  and  industrial  complexes  to  supply  heat  and  electricity  near  the

vicinity of the Metropolitan Landfill, and there were a lot of combustible and organic

wastes coming into the landfill that could be utilized for energy.

The  Metropolitan  Landfill  Eco-friendly  Energy  Town  uses  the  LFG  from  the

landfill to produce 50MWh of electricity, the largest amount of its kind in the world,

and operates a 200 ton/day SRF facility, with 25,000Nm3 of bio gas (methane content

of more than 60%) from anaerobic digestion of the food waste water.    In addition, the

Town  is  equipped  with  a  sewer  sludge  dry  fuel  facility  (1,000  tons/day),  a  bio  gas

automobile  fuel  facility  (10  m3/minute),  a  bio  circulation  forest,  a  resource

recirculation  research  center  and  training  facility,  an  international  exhibition hall and

convention facility.

######### 3)  Plans of the Me`tropolitan Landfill Futuristic Theme Park

The Metropolitan Landfill plans to go beyond its status of being the largest landfill

and  eco-friendly  energy  town,  to  form  a  global  theme  park  and  resort  of  the  future.

The  goal  of  this  project  is  to  contribute  to  the  activation  of  Incheon’s  economy  and

national  development  by  forming  a  multi-resort  complex  with  a  variety  of  contents

including  environmental,  touristic,  leisure,  recreational,  cultural,  amusement,  and

commercial.

######## The  multi-resort  theme  park  will  be  developed  on  5,4000,000  m2  of  land  which

includes the Zone 1 landfill and will house a Park & Resort Area, Golf & Healing Area,

and an Urban Entertainment Center (an urban cultural facility).

######## The Park & Resort will be 870,000 m2 in area comprised of a theme park, a water

park  and  condominiums  for  both  the  young  and  the  old  to  enjoy  together,  while  the
######## Golf  &  Healing  area  will  be  3,000,000  m2  and  incorporate  the  golf  course  that  is

already  in  use  with  a  healthcare  town  with  state-of-the-arts  medical  equipment  to  be
######## built.    The  Urban  Entertainment  Center  will  be  1,300,000  m2  and  will  house  a

shopping mall, outlets and hotels.

The Metropolitan Landfill hopes to take the second leap in development with the

formation  of  the  futuristic  theme  park,  taking  into  consideration  the  regional

advantages and conditions of the times.

IV.  Recommendation

### 1.  Recommendation for Number of Operational Trucks

##### 1.1. Evaluation Method for Collection Efficiency

###### 1.1.1.  MHT (Man Hour per Ton)

MHT is the man hour needed to collect one ton of waste, that is to say, the amount

of  time  needed  for  one  man  to  collect  one  ton  of  garbage.    This  number  changes

depending on the location of the garbage bin, distance, type and shape of the garbage

bin, and the ability and type of the collection truck.    In other words, the MHT is the

direct variable that represents the collection efficiency.

According  to  Dr.  Tchobanoglos  in  “Waste  Treatment  and  Disposal”,  the  garbage

bag  collection  method  involving  the  disposable  garbage  containers  was  the  most

efficient with 0.9 MHT, the usual street collection was 1.6 MHT, and the ‘set out’, ‘set

out & set back’, and ‘back yard carry’ where the sanitation workers had to go indoors

several  times  to  bring  out  the  wastes  were  the  most  labor-intensive  with  2.6  MHT.

Normally, based on the level o MHT equal to 1.0, collection efficiency is considered

good if it is below this number, and poor if it is above.    However, this MHT value is

the  official  time-expense  estimation  of  the  sanitation  workers,  so  the  number  can  be

reduced if the waste generation is coordinated amongst households.

###### 1.1.2.  The Time-Motion Study

The Time-Motion Study is a research done on the time it takes for the collection

trucks or carts to leave the depot until they return with a full load.    In this case also,

the value changes depending on the location of the garbage bin, the distance, the type

and shape of the garbage bin, the ability and type of the collection truck, the type of

residence  and  the  distance  between  the  collections.    Like  the  MHT  value,  the

63

2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)

collection time is determined depending on the type and location of the garbage bin,

and  the  actual  collection  time  is  used  to  influence  the  overall  collection  time.

Therefore,  it  can  be  understood  that  in  order  to  reduce  the  collection  time,  it  is

advisable to install movable rather than fixed garbage bins, outdoors instead of indoors,

and the best collection method is the ‘Bag’ method like the standardized garbage bags.

The  Time-Motion  Study  can  be  explained  as  follows,  and  this  data  is  used  to

determine the collection efficiency factor:

-  services/day/truck ː number of houses per day per truck

-  services/man/hr ː number of houses per man per hour

-  tons/day/truck ː collection volume per day per truck

-  tons/man/hr ː collection volume per man per hour

##### 1.2. Time-Motion Study in Barbados

###### 1.2.1.  Route Selection for the Time-Motion Study

In  terms  of  waste  disposal  collection,  Barbados  is  divided  into  five  regions  of

North, South East, South West, City East, and City West.    Taking into consideration

the  distance between the regions,  two  depots,  the Wildey  Depot  in  the  south  and the

North Depot in the north are in operation for the garbage trucks.    While the Wildey

64

2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)

Depot is responsible for collecting wastes  from four out of the  five regions  of  South

East, South West, City East and City West, the North Depot is only responsible for the

North region.

For the Time-Motion Study, two routes of South East and City West were selected

from the Wildey Depot.    Route 1 used the ML 271 collection truck with the capacity

of 14.25 tons.    The ML 271 left the garage at Wildey Depot, collected the wastes at

South  East’s  Mangrove  Ocean  City  Foul  Bay,  unloaded  at  the  SBRC  Landfill  and

returned to the Depot.    Route 2 used the ML 278 collection truck with the capacity of

######### 5.92 tons.    The truck left Wildey Depot for the Bridge Town Farm Road at City West

to collect the wastes, unloaded at the SBRC Landfill and also returned to the Depot.

#### Figure IV-1 | Time-Motion Study Routes

1.2.2.  Main Parameters of the Time-Motion Study

The  measured  values  for  the  two  routes  are  showed  in  Figure  IV-1  (above).    A

compactor  truck  with  a  driver  and  two  loaders  were  involved  in  the  Study.    While

most  of  the  countries  use  high  performance  small  trucks  for  collection  and  large

container-type  trucks  for  transportation,  Barbados  uses  small  compactor  trucks  for

both  collection  and  transportation.    This  is  because  the  overall  waste  transportation

distance in Barbados is short.

For Route 1, the collection site was 14km (19 minutes) from the Depot, and a total

of 10.66 tons of waste was collected from 372 pickups, travelling 14km (299 minutes)

within the collection region.    The collected wastes were taken to the landfill and then

the truck returned to the Depot.    Leaving from the Depot and returning back after the

collection took a total of 395 minutes and the distance traveled of 67km.    In the case

of Route 1 travelled by the ML 271 truck, the time for one collection was 6.6 hours,

and it was the route that had the 1 trip/day collection frequency so it is recommended

that a large truck be used for the long distances.

In  Route  2,  the  travel  distance  was  5km  (11  minutes)  from  the  Depot  to  the

collection  site,  and  a  total  of  4.72  tons  of  waste  was  collected  travelling  4km  (111

minutes) within the collection site, making 105 pickups.    The collected wastes were

taken  to  the  landfill  and  then  the  truck  returned  to  the  collection  site  to  collect  the

second  batch  of  collection  for  the  day.    Leaving  from  the  Depot  and  returning  back

after  the  collection  took  a  total  of  173  minutes,  and  the  total  distance  traveled  was

28km.    For  Route  2  where  the  compact  short  distance  truck  ML  278  was  used,  the

time for one collection was 2.9 hours, and it is the route with the collection frequency

of 2 or 3 trips/day.

Figure IV-2 | Parameters for the Time-Motion Study

###### 1.2.3.  Major Results of the Time-Motion Study

All major deducible results of the Time-Motion Study are presented in Figure IV-2

(above).    The  MHT,  the  most  important  numeric  value  in  this  study,  was  1.84  man

hour/ton which was slightly higher than the average for the outdoor movable or alley

collection  methods  but  indicated  that  a  comparably  efficient  collection  was  taking

place.    However,  the  time  it  takes  to  collect  one  ton  of  waste  was  reduced  by  more

than 1.4 times the standard collection, indicating that the loaders were very efficient.

As Route 1 and Route 2 were performed one outside the city center and one in the

downtown  (concentrated)  area  using  either  a  large  truck  or  a  compactor  truck

respectively, the results of the Time-Motion Study is somewhat different.    In the case

of the city center where there is a densely concentrated population, the time it took to

collect  one  ton  of  waste  was  less  than  outside  the  city  center,  but  the  volume  per

collection and time per collection was more than outside the city center.

##### 1.3. Estimation of the Required Number of Collection Trucks

It  is  possible  to  estimate  the  total  number  of  trucks  needed  for  waste  transport  in

Barbados  using  the  annual  waste  collection  results  or  the  results  from  the  Time-Motion

Study  directly,  and  to  determine  the  appropriate  number  using  the  complex  economic

feasibility evaluation.

The total waste collected in Barbados for 2014 was 184 tons/day, and in order to estimate

the required number of trucks to collect this volume, several preconditions must be met.    In

other words, it will be assumed that the total waste collection is 200 tons/day, work hours are

five days/week at eight hours/day, and the collection trucks will be used for waste collection

and transportation only.

###### 1.3.1.  Calculation  using  the  2014  Barbados  Waste  Management

####### Results

When reviewing the 2014 cleaning operations data for Barbados, it was recorded

that the trucks made about two trips a day to the landfill bringing in five tons per trip.

Accordingly,  it  was  stated  that  20  trucks  were  used  to  do  this  daily.    Taking  into

69

consideration  that  Barbados  currently  operates  53%  of  its  trucks,  it  can  be  estimated

that 38 trucks are needed.

###### 1.3.2.  Calculation using the Results of the MHT Directly

The  waste  collection  trucks  work  8  hours  a  day  with  a  team  of  three  people  per

truck and the planned collection of 200 tons per day.    So if the MHT value is adjusted

accordingly,  the  number  of  trucks  needed  is  16.    If  the  current  truck  defect  rate  of

Barbados (53%) is considered, then 30 trucks are needed.

                    To collect 200 tons/day,

                    MHT  〓  1.84 man·hrs/ton

                              ≒ 16 (3 men) x (8 hrs)/200 tons

###### 1.3.3.  Calculation Reflecting the Economic Feasibility

This method is applied when planning for the number of trucks needed during the

initial stages of operation or when planning to buy medium or large quantities of trucks

during  regular  operations.    This  method  is  used  to  determine  how  many  and  what

70

2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)

capacity  trucks  need  to  be  purchased.    However,  instead  of  deciding  the  capacity

through  planning,  it  is  expertly  determined  using  the  road  structure  and  collection

situation  in  many  instances.    Therefore,  this  method  is  suggested  as  a  general

recommendation instead of explaining the current situation of Barbados.

In  order  to  decide  on  how  many  and  what  capacity  trucks  are  needed,  it  is

necessary to apply the method on a variety of trucks.    First of all, a table is made with

random  volumes  on  the  vertical  using  the  results  of  the  Time-Motion  Study  or  the

annual operation results for Barbados, where 2, 4, 6, 8…, 18, 20 tons of waste volume

is selected.    In Table IV-6, 0.77 was used as the actual volume by averaging the load

ratio  of  Table  IV-4.    Next,  the  total  driving  time  of  Table  4-4  is  proportionally

considered and collection frequency for one day (8 hours) is calculated for each truck

capacity.    Therefore,  the  actual  load  volume  multiplied  by  collection  frequency  will

be the collection capacity per truck.

The  overall  collection  volume  is  estimated  as  10.78N2  +  12.32N4  +  13.86N6  +

15.40N10 + 10.78N14.    In Table 4-6, the 8-ton and 12-ton trucks appear to have less

collection  volume  overall  compared  to  the  other  trucks  with  the  same  collection

frequency,  so  they  seem  to  be  inefficient,  while  the  trucks  with  a  capacity  for  more

than 16 tons appear to have less than one collection per day, so they need to be utilized

for  other  special  purposes  rather  than  for  regular  waste  collections.    Taking  into

consideration  the  current  waste  collection  situation  in  Barbados,  it  appears  that  the

trucks needed are the 2-tonners, 4-tonners, 6-tonners, 10-tonners and 14-tonners.

For Step 2, the total volume of waste collected by the different capacity trucks in

Step 1 must be over 200 tons per day.    For this purpose, the following equation must

be analyzed, and the result will be presented with numerous values.    The maximum

value for N is the total number of the various volume trucks used per collection.    The

number of trucks needed by load capacity to collect 200 tons a day is 18 2-tonners, 17

4-tonners, 15 6-tonners, 13 10-tonners, and 18 14-tonners.

                    10.78N2 + 12.32N4 + 13.86N6 + 15.40N10 + 10.78N14 ≥ 200tons/day

########                     ⇒ many solutions are suggested

In the last step, the total cost per truck per day is calculated by using the number of

trucks  needed  per  capacity  in  Step  2  and  multiplying  the  daily  cost  of  the  truck

(＄BD/day).    The daily cost of the truck is calculated by adding the operation cost of

the truck (＄BD/day) such as purchase price depreciation, repair costs, and fuel costs,

taking into consideration the durability life of each truck.    The lower the expense the

more  economical,  so  using  trucks  with  various  capacities  is  the  most  economical

method.

### 2.  Recommendations for Waste Management

##### 2.1. Vehicle Defect

In looking at the defect ratio situation for waste collection equipment in Barbados, there

are a total of 66 trucks purchased within the last 10 years where 10 of these are in need of

repairs  and  21  are  damaged  beyond  operation,  making  the  total  of  31  trucks  inoperable.

This makes the defect ratio for the trucks purchased within 10 years to be 47%, making only

53% operable for waste collection.    This is the most serious problem for Barbados’s waste

management, so the following improvements are recommended:

- There needs to be a special policy for vehicle maintenance and repair.

  (easy  access  to  parts,  specialization  and  privatization  of  vehicle  repair  services,  local

residency in Barbados of mechanics from truck manufacturers)

- The required number of trucks needs to be secured.

- A fixed number of trucks must be purchased regularly every year according to a plan.

- The durability life of the trucks should be determined so their usage can be legally stopped

after their lifecycles expire, meaning that a phase-out plan is needed to eventually phase

out old trucks so that the total number of trucks is not distorted..

##### 2.2. Other Waste Management

The roads in the Barbados city center is arranged in a grid with many one-way streets,

and  the  intersections  are  roundabouts,  making  it  easy  for  the  garbage  trucks  to  travel.

However,  the  local  roads  are  double  lanes  only  with  narrow  tree-type  layouts,  and  since

many houses are located in dead-end alleys off the main roads, access for the garbage trucks

are quite difficult.

As the structural characteristics of the roads determine the waste collection method, the

Curb  Service  and  Alley  Service  currently  used  in  Barbados  is  considered  to  be  very

reasonable.    It appears that with the exception of the deficient vehicles, waste management

of Barbados is appropriate and well executed, with the following improvements for reference.

###### 2.2.1.  Methods to Improve the MHT Efficiency

The problem with the road structures of Barbados is that they are only double lanes

and many dead-ends.    In other words, the roads outside the city center is developed in

the  tree  line-type  structure  and  the  houses  are  built  parallel along  the  roads  in  alleys

with  dead-ends.    The  narrow  roads  are  the  cause  for  traffic  jams  or  traffic  stops

resulting  from  illegal  parking,  but  on  the  other  hand,  the advantage  of  these  roads is

that garbage collection can be done from both sides of the road simultaneously.

Currently, the garbage trucks leave the alleys driving backwards due to the dead-

ends.    The  road  structure  that  are  the  obstacles  for  waste  collection  need  to  be

improved with urban planning, but if the dead-ends can be linked together to make a

flow traffic road, garbage collection will be easier.    The following recommendations

can be presented to help with this problem:

######### -  The dead-end streets can be linked together for flow traffic to make it easy for

garbage collection (See figure below).

######### -  The residents living on the dead-end streets can bring their garbage voluntarily

to the curbs of the main roads for collection.

######### -  The collection trucks can be equipped with small mobile carts and these carts

are used for the collection.

Barbados  used  the  alley  and  curb  collection  services.    By  looking  at  the  Time-

Motion  Study,  the  average  distance  between  garbage  bins  are  38m,  so  as  one  of  the

ways to increase collection efficiency, the distances between the bins can be increased

and larger bins can be used.

Furthermore, if the collection route is transcribed in the order of the district names,

it should be changed into drawings and graphics to make it easy if the loaders change,

so the new loaders can memorize the collection routes better.    To date, the trucks in

Barbados  are  not  equipped  with  GPS  navigators  so  it  seems  like  the  graphic  route

maps  are  needed,  and  when  the  trucks  get  equipped  with  GPS,  the  collection  routes

can be displayed on the screens rather than the drawings.

2.2.2.  Street  Sweeping  and  Collection  Improvement  for  Narrow

####### Alleys

Currently,  street sweeping in Barbados is done by  workers with wheeled garbage

######## bins  (60∼120L),  and  narrow  alleys  in  the  city  center  are  cleaned  by  small  tracker-

shaped lorry loaders.    In the case of Korea, automatic water-charged vehicles or rear

cars  are  used  for  street  sweeping.    The  rear  cars  are  more  stable  compared  to  the

wheeled  bins and are  easy  to  use,  with the  advantage  of  having  the  ability  to  link  to

bicycles or motorcycles for power.

#### Figure IV-5 | Equipments for Street Cleaning

###### 2.2.3.  Systemization and Computerization of Waste Management

It  appears  that  Barbados  needs  to  construct  a  database  on  wastes  for  a  more

advanced waste management system in the future.    In order to construct the database,

concerned laws must define what waste is, establish a classification system, and select

the classification codes to serve as the basis for the computerization.    Afterwards, in

order  to  determine  the  flow  of  the  waste  management  system,  the  waste  generation,

77

2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)

transportation, treatment and disposal process need to be computerized.    The GPS or

RFID can be used partially for this purpose.

######### -  Construction of the database for wastes including the definition, establishment

of the waste system and cataloged (Barbados Waste Code, BWC)

-  Selection of the Classification Codes

-  Computerization  of  the  waste  generation,  transportation,  treatment,  and

disposal process (computerization, Just-in-Time Record System)

-  Regular conduction of statistical surveys on wastes

-  Application of the GPS and RFID systems and optimization of routes

###### 2.2.4.  Waste Collection

Improvements for the waste collection are as follows:

######### -  Collection  bags  and  bins  need  to  be  standardized  for  easy  and  efficient

collection.

######### -  Existing  defect  ratio  of  trucks  needs  be  improved  by  using  various  types  of

collection trucks

######### -  Instead  of  just  using  collection  region  information  as  route  information,  the

actual road routes used by the collection trucks should be mapped out onto a

map for better visual management and checking of route coverage.

######### -  It  will  be  difficult  to  improve  on  the  current  collection  routes  because  the

drivers  have  currently  optimized their driving  routes  to  be  the most  optimum

according  to  the  region  of  their  pick-up.    Therefore,  a  GPS-based  tracking

system is not needed in order to optimize the collection routes.

######### -  Automatic  Pipeline  Collection  System  could  be  considered  the  in  the  city

center  with  a  high  population  density  in  order  to  improve  the  waste

administration and collection efficiency

######### -  RFID-based tracking system for medical waste could be considered in order to

track the whole collection and disposal process of medical waste.

78

2.2.5.  Waste Treatment and Disposal

Improvements for waste treatment and disposal are as follows:

-  The re-using and recycling can be optimized with realized policies.

-  Automated  sorting  devices  should  be  installed  at  the  disposal  or  recycling

transshipment depots to efficiently promote the 3Rs.

-  Reclaim the methane gas from the existing landfill

-  The burying amount can be minimized and the life durability of the landfill can

be extended by digging and reorganizing the existing landfill.

######### -  The Waste-to-Energy Policy should be established.    In the case for Barbados,

it  is  possible  to  produce  450  tons/day  of  92%  combustible  MSW  and  300

tons/day  of  RDF  (Refuse  Derived  Fuels).    With  heat  (100  tons/day  x  3

incinerators) treatment, it will be possible to produce 10MW of electricity, 25

Gcal/hr of heat, and 10,000 USRT of cold air.

3.  Economic Feasibility Analysis

##### 3.1. Method of Analysis

In  this  section,  the  economic  feasibility  analysis  of  the  purchasing  15  additional

collection trucks is performed using benefit-cost analysis.    For this purpose, social benefit

and  cost  of  the  purchase  are  estimated,  and  the  economic  feasibility  is  analyzed  using  Net

Present Value (NPV) Method, Economic Internal Return Rate (EIRR), and Benefit/Cost ratio

(B/C ratio).

The  NPV  method  is  the  most  widely  used  technique  for  economic  feasibility  analysis.

NPV is the sum of present value (PV) cash inflows subtracted by the sum of present value

(PV)  cash  outflows.    When  the  NPV  value  in  the  formula  is  greater  than  0,  the  project  is

considered as economically feasible.    Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) or Internal

Rate  of  Return  (IRR)  provides  a  discount  rate  that  equals  the  sum  of  present  value  cash

inflows  and  the  sum  of  present  value  cash  outflows.    As  a  decision  criterion  to  economic

feasibility, the EIRR of an investment alternative needs to be greater than social discount rate

(social  discount  rate  in  the  analysis  is  12%).    Benefit/Cost  Ratio  shows  the  ratio  of  the

benefit value of a project relative to its cost value.    Since the NPV values are influenced by

the  volume  of  investment,  B/C  ratio  is  used  complementary.    When  a  B/C  ratio  is  larger

than 1, the investment alternative is economically feasible.

In  addition  sensitivity  analysis  was  also  performed  to  analyze  the  sensitivity  of  the

investment relative to changes in the discount rate, the overall costs, and the overall benefits.

##### 3.2. Assumptions Used for the Analysis

###### 3.2.1.  Inflation Rate

We  used  the  average  Barbados  inflation  rate  compiled  by  the  IMF  from  2012  to

2014  as  the  inflation  rate  that  will  be  applied  to  the  estimation  of  the  various  future

values for the economic feasibility analysis.

###### 3.2.2.  Period of Analysis

We  assumed  that  5  collection  trucks  will  be  purchased  every  year  for  3  years

starting 2016 for a total of 15 new trucks being purchased within the three year period.

The reason for the purchase of 15 new trucks is assumed from the recommendations

for  the  number  of  operational  trucks  (Section  IV.1)  where  the  minimum  number  of

required  trucks  was  calculated  as  being  over  30  trucks  and  currently  there  are  only

about 15 trucks that are operational at this moment for the SSA.

The start of the benefits obtained from the purchasing of new collection trucks was

assumed  to  be  from  2017  which  is  one  year  after  the  initial  purchase  in  2016.    The

total  period  for  the  benefits  to  arise  was  assumed  to  be  10  years  after  the  initial

purchase.    Salaries  for  drivers  and  loaders,  cost  of  gasoline,  and  maintenance  costs

for the trucks were assumed to occur every year after the purchase of the new trucks;

the total period of the economic feasibility analysis is 13 years from 2016 to 2028.

###### 3.2.3.  Discount Rate

We applied 12% as the discount rate for the economic feasibility analysis because

12%  is  the  standard  discount  rate  used  by  the  Export-Import  Bank  of  Korea  for  all

their financial analysis of developing countries.

##### 3.4. Benefit Analysis

###### 3.4.1.  Benefit Components

The following benefits are expected to arise with the purchase of 15 new collection

trucks:

######### -  Prevention  of  decrease  in  tourism  due  to  environmentally  unhealthy  and

visually  unclean  situations  that  might  be  caused  by  deficiencies  in  waste

collection from key tourist attractions, and

######### -  Reduction in salary from not working over-time in week-ends

83

2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)

3.4.2.  Benefit Details

1) The money savings arising from the prevention of the decrease in tourism can

  be used as a benefit for purchasing new collection trucks because there was a case

in Napoli, Italy where tourism income dropped significantly in 2008 due to problems

in waste collection and street cleaning.

The benefit obtained in terms of prevention of the decrease in tourism can be

  calculated using the following formula:

  benefit = (number of new trucks) x (average yearly income from tourism) x

      (percentage of decrease in tourism with shortage of one truck) x

      (1 + inflation rate)

  where

percentage of decrease in tourism with shortage of one truck was

assumed to be 0.01% and average yearly income from tourism was

assumed to be USD 1.098 Billion (www.wttc.org).

: Year 2017

benefit = 5 x USD 1.098 B x 0.01%    = USD 549,000

: Year 2018

######## benefit = 10 x USD 1.098 B x 0.001%    x inflation

= USD 1,116,000

: Year 2019 to Year 2028

######## benefit    = 15 x USD 1.098 B x 0.001%    x inflation

2) With more collection trucks, SSA personnel do not have to work on weekends

  which translates to savings in over-time payments.

The benefit obtained in terms reduction in over-time salary can be calculated using

  the following formula:

  benefit = (number of new trucks) x (average daily salary of SSA workers) x

      (number of workers per truck) x (number of days of over-time per year)

x 1.5 x (1 + inflation rate)

  where

average daily salary of SSA workers was assumed to be USD 100 per

84

2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)

day (USD 24,000 yearly income from data received from SSA which

is equal to the per capita GDP of Barbados in 2014, www.indexmundi.

com) and the number of days of over-time was assumed to be 4 days

per month.

: Year 2017

benefit    = 5 x USD 100 x 3 x 1.5 x 48 days = USD 108,000

: Year 2018

benefit    = 10 x USD 100 x 3 x 1.5 x 48 days    x inflation

: Year 2019 to Year 2028

benefit    = 15 x USD 100 x 3 x 1.5 x 48 days

= USD 219,000

x inflation

###### 3.4.3.  Benefit Table

The  following  two  Tables  show  the  amount  of  yearly  benefits  obtained  from

purchasing 15 new collection trucks for the next 13 years.    The total present value of

all the benefits is USD 9,520,000

##### 3.5. Results of the Economic Feasibility Analysis

The  following  Table  summarizes  the  results  of  the  economic  feasibility  analysis  with

total  benefits  being  USD  9,520,000  and  total  costs  being  USD  4,430,000.    The  NPV  was

USD  5,990,000  which  is greater than  0,  B/C  Ratio  was  2.15  which  is  greater  than  1.0  and

finally the IRR was 43.77% which is greater than 12.00%.    Therefore, the results show that

it is economically feasible to purchase the 15 new collection trucks.

##### 3.6. Sensitivity Analysis

The  NPV,  B?C  Ration,  and  IRR  were  calculated  for  cases  when  the  overall  cost  is

increased  or  decreased  by  10%  and  20%  and  at  the  same  time  the  overall  benefit  is  also

increased  or  decreased  by  10%  and  20%.    The  Table  below  shows  the  results  for  the

different cases of variations.

We can determine from the results of the sensitivity analysis that even with the variations

in costs and benefits increased or decreased up to 20%, the results of the economic feasibility

study  stands  because  the  NPV  was  always  greater  than  0,  B/C  Ration  was  always  greater

than 1, and the IRR was always greater than 12.00%.

V.  Conclusions and Suggestions

The general assessment of services provided by the Sanitation Services Authority (SSA)

of Barbados related to waste collection, disposal and management is that they are currently

doing  a  very  good  job  in  all  areas  of  waste  collection,  disposal  and  management.    SSA’s

drivers and loaders are very hard working and the managers are dedicated in providing the

best possible service to the citizens with the limited resources they have available to them.

The  collection  routes  are  very  efficient  and  it  will  be  hard  to  improve  on  their  current

collection efficiency.

The  areas  that  need  improvements  and  upgrades  are  1)  more  effective  means  of

maintenance  of  collection  trucks,  2)  purchase  of  additional  collection  trucks  to  replace  old

model trucks that are not functioning to capacity, 3) mapping out actual collection routes on

a map, 4) construction of a leachate treatment facility, 5) construction of a waste-to-energy

plant to incinerate most of the combustible solid waste prior to burial, 6) increased recycling

at the source in order to reduce the amount of waste, 7) designing of a waste code specific to

Barbados, 8) development of a waste database to facilitate data management and retrieval, 9)

development  of  a  computer  program  for  waste  management,  10)  research  and  analysis  on

setting  up  intermediary  transfer  stations  throughout  the  island,  11)  standardizing  trash  bins

and  garbage  bags  to  facilitate  collection,  and  12)  developing  metrics  to  measure  the

performance of collection, transportation and disposal of solid waste.

The  results  of  this  Consulting  Project  can  be  used to  better  plan  for  future  activities  in

waste  collection,  disposal  and  management  in  Barbados.    Barbados  is  one  of  the  leading

countries  in  waste  collection  and  management  in  the  Caribbean  and  hopefully  the  lessons

learned  through  this  project  can  be  transferred  to  other  countries  in  the  Caribbean.    Our

final  proposal  is  for  the  Caribbean  countries  to  form  an  association  related  to  waste

management  throughout  the  Caribbean  so  that  countries  can  share  each  other’s  knowledge

and expertise as well as collectively strategize concerning the future directions pertaining to

waste management in all Caribbean countries.
