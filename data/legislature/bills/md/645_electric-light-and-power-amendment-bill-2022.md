The  principal  Act  is  amended  by  inserting  after  section  5,  the

“Representations or objections regarding application for
licence

5A.(1)
An interested party who desires to make a representation or
an objection in relation to an application for a licence by an applicant
to  whom  section  5(3)  applies  shall,  within  28  days  of  the  first
publication of notice of the application, inform the Minister in writing
of his representation or objection.

(2)

The interested party

(a)

shall state his interest in the application;

5

(b)

(c)

(d)

shall,  as  far  as  practicable,  state  concisely,  in  numbered
paragraphs,
the  precise  nature  and  ground  of  his
representation or objection;

shall include any supporting evidence; and

shall not make a representation or an objection in respect of
anything  that  is  not  directly  related  to  a  matter  set  out  in
section 6(2)(b) or (3).

Where  the  Minister,  after  consultation  with  the  Committee,
(3)
considers that there is merit in a representation or objection made by
an interested party but additional information on the representation or
objection is required, the Minister may, within 28 days of receipt of the
representation or objection, give the interested party an opportunity to
provide such information orally or in writing.

An interested party shall be given no less than 14 days’ written
(4)
notice  of  the  date  on  which  he  will  have  an  opportunity  to  provide
additional information pursuant to subsection (3).

The  Committee  shall,  in  making  a  recommendation  to  the
(5)
Minister in respect of an application for a licence, take into account any
representation or objection made in relation to the application that the
Minister considers to have merit.

Nothing in this section entitles an interested party to have access

(6)
to information in the application of an applicant where

(a)

(b)

the applicant requests, in accordance with subsection (7), that
the information be kept confidential; and

the  Minister,  after  consultation  with  the  Committee,
determines that there is merit in the request and grants the
request.

6

(7)

A request for confidentiality under subsection (6) shall include

(a)

(b)

a  summary  of  the  nature  of  the  information  to  be  kept
confidential;

the reason for the request, including details of the specific
harm  that  would  result  if  the  information  were  publicly
disclosed; and

(c)

any  objection  to  the  disclosure  of  a  summary  of  the
information.

Notwithstanding subsection (6)(b), the Minister shall not grant a
(8)
request  for  confidentiality  where,  after  consultation  with
the
Committee,  the  Minister  determines  that  the  public  interest  in  the
disclosure of the information outweighs the interest of the applicant in
keeping the information confidential.”.
