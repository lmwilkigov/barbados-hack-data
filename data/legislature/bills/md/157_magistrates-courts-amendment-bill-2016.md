“General nature of committal proceedings

17.(1)

facie case has been established for the committal of a person accused
of an indictable offence for the trial of that offence by the High Court,
except where

(a)

(b)

an enactment contains an express provision to the contrary;
or

it appears to him that in respect of the whole or any part of

be served by his sitting in open court.

Committal  proceedings  and  any  determination  made

in
(2)
committal proceedings by an examining magistrate shall be given in

allow  the  committal  proceedings  to  proceed  or  be  completed  in  the

Insertion of section 17A into Cap. 116A

4.

The principal Act is amended by inserting the following new section

“Submission of evidence in committal proceedings

17A.(1)
Subject  to  section  18B,  for  the  purposes  of  committal
proceedings, evidence with or without exhibits, before an examining
magistrate  shall  consist  of  written  statements,  whether  for  the
prosecution  or  the  defence,  and  these  written  statements  shall  be
admissible as evidence in the same manner as oral evidence given by a
person where the written statement

(a)

is prepared from a statement which was recorded, whether in
writing or by electronic means, by a senior member of the
Royal Barbados Police Force not below the rank of Sergeant
or an attorney-at-law;

(b)

purports to be signed by the person who made it;

(c)

(d)

contains a declaration or statement by the person who made
it, stating that the written statement is true to the best of his
knowledge and belief; and

contains a declaration by the person who made it stating that
he  made  the  written  statement  knowing  that,  if  it  were
tendered in evidence, he would be liable to prosecution if he
wilfully stated in it anything which he knew to be false or did
not believe to be true.

(2)

Where a written statement to which subsection (1) applies

(a)

is made by a person under the age of 18, it shall state or give
the age of that person;

9

(b)

(c)

(d)

is made by the accused person, it shall contain a declaration
or  statement  stating  that  he  made  the  written  statement
knowing that, if it were tendered in evidence, he may be liable
to be committed for prosecution by the High Court;

is made by a person who cannot read, it shall be read to him
before  he  signs  it,  and  that  written  statement  shall  be
accompanied  by  a  declaration  by  the  person  who  read  the
written  statement,  and  that  declaration  shall  state  that  the
written  statement  was  read  to  the  person  who  made  the
written statement; or

makes reference to any other document as an exhibit, the copy
of the written statement given to the examining magistrate or
to any other party to the proceedings under subsection (3),
must be accompanied by a copy of that document or by such
information as may be necessary in order to enable the party
to whom it is given to inspect that document or a copy thereof.

Before a written statement tendered in evidence in accordance
(3)
with  subsection  (1)  is  used  in  committal  proceedings,  an  examining
magistrate shall ensure that

(a)

a copy of the written statement is given, by or on behalf of
the party proposing to tender it, to each of the other parties
to the committal proceedings; and

(b)

none of the other parties object to the written statement being
tendered in evidence under this section.

Any document or object referred to as an exhibit and identified
(4)
in a written statement tendered in evidence under this section shall be
treated as if it had been produced as an exhibit and identified in court
by the maker of the written statement.

Notwithstanding  subsection  (1),  nothing  shall  prevent  the
(5)
accused person or his attorney-at-law from making a submission to the

10

examining magistrate that the evidence is not sufficient to commit the
accused person to the High Court for the trial of the alleged indictable
offence, and if any such submission is made, the same shall be taken
into  consideration  by  the  examining  magistrate  for  the  purposes  of
section 19, and where a person is not represented by an attorney-at-law
the examining magistrate shall inform the accused of his right under
this subsection.

For  the  purposes  of  this  Part,  section  25  of  the  Criminal
(6)
Procedure Act, Cap. 127 applies to any written statement tendered in
evidence in committal proceedings, as it applies to a deposition taken
in such proceedings, but in its application to any such written statement
that section has effect as if the words “and where it is also proved that
such a deposition was taken in the presence of the person so accused
and  that  he  or  his  attorney-at-law  had  a  full  opportunity  of  cross-
examining the witness, then if such a deposition purports to be signed
by the magistrate by or before whom the same purports to have been
taken” were omitted therefrom.

For  the  purposes  of  this  Part,  section  4(3)  of  the  Criminal
(7)
Procedure Act, Cap. 127 applies to the facts disclosed in any written
statement as it would apply to facts disclosed in a deposition.

A person whose written statement is tendered in evidence under
(8)
this section shall be treated for the purposes of section 30 as a witness
who has been examined by the examining magistrate.”.

MAGISTRATE’S COURTS (AMENDMENT) ACT, 2016

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

This Bill would amend the Magistrate’s Courts Act, Cap. 116A to make better
provision for committal proceedings under the Act by requiring the general use
of written statements rather than the general use of oral evidence and depositions,
and to provide for related matters.

Clause 1:

Clause 2:

Clause 3:

Clause 4:

gives the citation of the amending Act; this the Act should be
cited as the Magistrate’s Courts (Amendment) Act, 2016.

amends  the  interpretation  section  of  the  Act  to  amend  the
definition of committal proceedings and to insert a definitions
for examining magistrate, Registrar, and accused or accused
person.

amends section 17 to make provision for any determination
made by an examining magistrate to be given in the presence
of the accused, but provides for certain instances in which a
determination may be made in the absence of the accused. This
section also defines High Court for the purposes of the this
Part of the Act.

provides  for  the  submission  of  evidence  in  committal
proceedings to be by way of written statements, in addition it
also provides for what must be done for a written statement to
be accepted for use in committal proceedings.

Clause 5:

inserts 7 new sections into the Magistrates’ Courts Act, Cap.
116A. These sections will be discussed in turn:

Clause 18A: makes provision for the examining magistrate to take oral
evidence  where  the  taking  of  such  evidence  will  assist  the  court  in

i

Magistrate’s Courts (Amendment) Act,
2016

making a determination in the matter and for any party to the committal
proceedings to make an application for oral evidence to be taken.

Clause 18B: expressly retains certain options for the accused, in the
interest of justice, this clause makes it clear that the accused need not
give a written statement, oral evidence or an unsworn statement.

Clause 18C provides for the exchange of written statements prior to
the  commencement  of  committal  proceedings  and  requires  that  this
exchange should be done at least seven days before the commencement
of  the  committal  proceedings.  This  is  to  give  adequate  notice  to
facilitate  preparation  for  the  committal  proceedings,  and  where
adequate  notice  has  not  been  given  this  clause  provides  for  an
application to be made for more time.

Clause 18D: provides for the examining magistrate to sign the written
statements  and  the  exhibits  to  ensure  easy  verification  of  the
authenticity and integrity of the material which is to be transmitted for
the trial of the offence.

Clause 18E: provides for the use of the written statements from the
committal  proceeding  in  the  trial  of  the  accused  where  the  person
making that written statement cannot be at the trial due to death, illness,
threat or for other stated reasons.

Clause 18F: provides for the examining magistrate to give a warning
of the requirement to give notice of the defence of an alibi and requires
the examining magistrate to explain the consequences of not giving
this notice of the defence of alibi. It also provides for the examining
magistrate to ensure that the accused understands the terminology in
clause 18G as well as options available to the accused in respect of the
giving of the notice of the defence of alibi; and

Clause 18G: makes mandatory provision for the accused to give notice
of the defence of alibi in order for the accused to be able to rely on the
defence of alibi at the trial of the offence. This will assist in ensuring

ii

Magistrate’s Courts (Amendment) Act,
2016

that an accused person with a verifiable alibi does not waste judicial
time or the financial resources of the public.

Clause 6:

Clause 7:

Clause 8:

Clause 9:

Clause 10:

Clause 11:

amends  section  19  to  makes  provision  for  the  examining
magistrate to either discharge the accused or commit him for
trial by the High Court on the basis of written statements and
where  the  examining  magistrate  decides  to  commit  the
accused  for  trial  he  can  either  grant  bail  or  commit  him  to
custody until trial.

amends  section  20  of  the  principal  Act  to  provide  for  the
accused who has been placed in custody under section 19(2)
to make such further applications for bail as may be permitted
under the Bail Act, Cap. 122A

amends section 21 to make provision for the use of written
statements in instances where there is an admission of guilt,
but this can only be used for offences other than the offence
of murder, treason or high treason.

amends section 23 to provide the transmission of the written
statements  and  the  written  record  of  depositions  to  the
Director  of  Public  Prosecutions  and  the  Registrar  of  the
Supreme Court.

amends section 30 of the Act to make provision for the use of
written statements.

amends section 55 to provide for written statements used in a
committal proceeding to be used in a summary trial where the
committal proceedings are converted to a summary trial.

Clause 12:

repeals section 132 as this section is no longer required in the
new legislative scheme.

iii

Clause 13:

Clause 14:

Clause 15:

Clause 16:

Magistrate’s Courts (Amendment) Act,
2016

amends  section  136  to  make  provision  for  the  offence  of
perjury in respect of sections 17A or section 18B rather than
under section 132, as section 132 is now repealed.

makes specific provision for the transition from the general
use of depositions to the general use of written statements and
for  the  provisions  of  this  Act  to  automatically  apply  to
committal  proceedings  which  are  slated  to  begin  after  the
commencement  of  this  Act.  In  the  interest  of  fairness
provision  is  also  made  for  an  accused  to  elect  to  have  his
committal  proceedings  subject  to  this  Act  in  circumstances
where those committal proceedings are already in process at
the commencement of this Act.

amends other Acts which will be affected by the new regime
for committal proceedings .
