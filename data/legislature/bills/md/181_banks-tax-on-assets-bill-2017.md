Where  a  bank  fails  to  make  payment  as  required  by  this  Act,  the

called an unpaid tax certificate.

An unpaid tax certificate may be filed by the Commissioner in the High
(2)
Court or in a magistrates’ court for District “A” and shall be registered in the
court in which it is filed.

A certificate referred to in subsection (2) has, after the expiry of a period
(3)
of 7 days from the date on which it is filed and registered, the same force and
effect as a judgement of the court in which it is registered in favour of the Crown
against  the  bank  named  in  the  certificate,  for  the  amount  specified  in  the
certificate and also for

(a)

(b)

interest on that amount at the rate of 1.5 per cent per month calculated
for each month on the unpaid balance of the tax; and

the reasonable costs and charges attendant upon the registration of the
certificate.

All proceedings may be taken on an unpaid tax certificate and the certificate

may be enforced as if it were a judgement of the court in which it is registered.

Where an unpaid certificate is filed by the Commissioner in the High Court
(5)
or in a magistrates’ court for District “A”, the Commissioner shall immediately
deliver a copy of the certificate to the bank to which the certificate relates and if
the copy of the certificate is not delivered within 7 days from the date of filing
subsections (3) and (4) shall cease to have effect in respect of the certificate.

excess,

outstanding liability of that bank under this Act and then pay over to the bank the
balance, if any.

An application for a refund shall not be considered unless the application
