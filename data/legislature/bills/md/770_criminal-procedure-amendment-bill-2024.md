“Mode of trial

3.
Every  person  against  whom  a  bill  of  indictment  has  been

and substituting the following:

Section 7 of the principal Act is amended by deleting subsection (1)

“(1)
The judge shall, if a person arraigned on indictment pleads “not
guilty”, inform the person that he may elect to be tried by a Judge sitting
alone or a Judge sitting with a jury.

(1A)
Where  the  person  referred  to  in  subsection  (1)  upon  being
arraigned, elects to be tried by a Judge sitting alone, the court shall only
make an order that the person be tried by a judge sitting alone if it is
satisfied that the person

(a)

has sought and received legal advice from an attorney-at-law
in relation to a trial by a Judge sitting alone; and

5

(b)

has filed with the Registrar of the Supreme Court a certificate
in the form set out as Form A in the First Schedule.

(1B)
Where  a  person  is  not  represented  by  an  attorney-at-law  and
elects to be tried by a Judge sitting alone, the Court shall make an order
that the person be tried by a Judge sitting alone if it is satisfied that the
person

(a)

is competent and has waived his right to consult an attorney-
at-law for legal advice in relation to a trial by a Judge sitting
alone; and

(b)

has filed with the Registrar of the Supreme Court a certificate
in the form set out as Form B in the First Schedule.

The Court shall not make an order for a trial by a Judge sitting

(1C)
alone unless it is satisfied that

(a)

in  the  case  of  a  joint  trial,  all  other  accused  persons  have
elected to be tried by a Judge sitting alone and each accused
person has filed a certificate in the form set out as Form A or
B in the First Schedule, as the case may be, in accordance
with subsection (1A) or (1B); and

(b)

where 2 or more charges are to be tried together, the accused
person  has  elected  to  be  tried  by  a  Judge  sitting  alone  in
respect of all the charges.

Subject to subsection (1E), where the first hearing after the filing
(1D)
of  an  indictment  against  an  accused  person  took  place  before  the
commencement of this section

the Registrar of the Supreme Court shall cause to be served
on the accused person, a notice informing him that he may,
at least 60 days before the date fixed for his trial, apply to the
Court for a trial by a Judge sitting alone; and

6

(b)

the person may apply to the Court for a trial by a Judge sitting
alone.

(1E)
The Court shall not proceed to try the person by a Judge sitting
alone  unless  it  is  satisfied  that  the  accused  person  understands  the
difference between a trial by a Judge sitting alone and a trial by a Judge
sitting with a jury.

(1F)

The Court shall not proceed to trial by a Judge sitting alone

(a)

(b)

if there are 2 or more accused, unless all accused have elected
to be tried by a Judge sitting alone; and

if there are 2 or more charges in the indictment unless the
accused  has  elected  to  be  tried  by  a  Judge  sitting  alone  in
respect of all charges.

An accused who has elected for trial by a Judge sitting alone may
(1G)
withdraw his election before his trial begins and elect to be tried by a
Judge sitting with a jury.”.

References to jury in other enactments

7C.(1)
A reference in this Act or in any other enactment to a jury,
the verdict of a jury or the finding of a jury shall be read, in relation to
a trial by a Judge sitting alone, as a reference to the Judge, the verdict
of the Judge or the finding of the Judge, as the case may be.

For the purposes of a trial by a Judge sitting alone, the provisions
(2)
of this Act or any other enactment, insofar as they are predicated on a
trial by a Judge sitting with a jury, shall be read and construed with such
modifications,  adaptations,  qualifications  and  exceptions  as  may  be
necessary to bring them into conformity with a trial by a Judge sitting
alone.

Judge to give reasons for decision

When the case on both sides is closed in a trial by a Judge
7D.(1)
sitting alone, the Judge shall, as soon as reasonably practicable and in
any event before the expiration of 14 days, deliver his verdict and, in
the case of a conviction, he shall give a written judgment setting out

(a)

(b)

the principles of law applied by the Judge; and

the findings of fact on which the Judge relied.

If any other law requires a warning to be given to a jury in any
(2)
such case, the Judge sitting alone shall take the warning into account
in dealing with the case.

Subject to subsection (4), where an accused person is acquitted
(3)
in a trial by a Judge sitting alone, the Judge may give reasons for his
verdict.

Where  the  prosecution  requests  reasons  for  an  acquittal,  the

(4)
Judge shall give reasons within 14 days of that request.

8

offence charged in such indictment, then and in every such case the jury
or the Judge may acquit the defendant of such arrestable offence and
find him guilty of unlawfully wounding and thereupon such defendant

wounding.”; and

Where, upon the trial of any person charged with any offence, it

reason thereof be entitled to be acquitted but the jury or the Judge shall
be at liberty to return as the verdict that the defendant is not guilty of
the offence charged but is guilty of an attempt to commit the same, and
thereupon such person shall be liable to be punished in the same manner
as if he had been convicted upon an indictment for attempting to commit

person as an offence, and it is given in evidence on the trial of such
person for that offence that he was insane, so as not to be responsible

if it appears to the jury or the Judge, as the case may be, before whom
such person is tried that he did the act charged, but was insane when he
