duties; and

(b)

paid such fees as the Minister may prescribe by regulations.

of his expenses and fees, the same rights and remedies in respect thereof that a
salvor has in respect of salvage due to him and may, if the property in respect of
which any such expenses and fees are due is not under arrest in any court, seize
or detain the property until his expenses and fees are paid, or until security is
given to his satisfaction.

Duties of receiver

218.(1)

near the coast of Barbados, the receiver shall, upon being made acquainted with
such stranding or distress

(a)

(b)

(c)

forthwith proceed to that place;

upon arrival at that place take the command of all persons present; and

obstruction; and

(c)

require all persons in the vicinity to assist him.

Passage over adjoining lands

persons, the cargo or apparel of the vessel

(a)

pass  and  repass,  with  or  without  vehicles  and  equipment,  over  any
adjoining lands without being subject to interruption by the owner or
occupier, unless there is some public road equally convenient; and

151

(b)

deposit on those lands any cargo or other things recovered from the
vessel,

but  that  person  may  not  do  any  more  damage  to  the  adjoining  lands  than  is
reasonably necessary for the purpose of rendering that assistance.

Any damage sustained by the owner or occupier in consequence of the
(2)
exercise of the rights conferred by subsection (1) is a charge on the vessel, cargo
or articles in respect of, or by which, the damage is occasioned; and the amount
payable in respect of the damage shall, in case of dispute, be determined, and in
default of payment, recoverable in the same manner as the amount of salvage is

transmit a similar description to the Minister.

The Minister may give such publicity to the description of the wreck as he

(2)
thinks fit.

Owner’s right to wreck

226.(1)
Where  any  wreck  is  in  the  possession  of  a  receiver  and  its  owner
establishes  his  claim  to  the  wreck  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  receiver  within  6
months from the time the wreck came into possession of the receiver, the owner
is, upon paying the customs duty, if any, and the salvage fees and expenses due,
entitled to have the wreck or the proceeds of sale of the wreck delivered up to
him or his agent.

When  any  wreck  in  the  possession  of  the  receiver  is  shown  to  the
(2)
satisfaction  of  the  Minister  to  belong  to  an  owner  in  a  foreign  country,  the
Minister may, in the absence of the owner or his agent, deem the consular officer
of that foreign country in Barbados to be the owner in respect of the custody and
disposal of the wreck.

Power to sell wreck

227.(1)

A receiver may immediately sell a wreck in his possession where

(a)

(b)

it is in his opinion to the advantage of all parties to sell the wreck; or

154

(2)
The proceeds of a sale, pursuant to subsection (l), after levying customs
duty, if any, and defraying the expenses of the sale, shall be held by the receiver
for the same purposes and subject to the same claims, rights and liabilities as if
the wreck had remained unsold.

Unclaimed wreck

Where  any  wreck  is  in  the  possession  of  a  receiver  and  no  owner
228.
establishes  a  claim  to  it  within  6  months  after  it  came  into  the  receiver’s
possession, the receiver may sell the wreck and pay the proceeds of sale to the
State

(a)

(b)

after deducting the expenses of the sale, any customs duty payable, and
any other expenses incurred by him from the proceeds; and

after paying to the salvors out of the proceeds such amount of salvage
as the Minister may determine.

Discharge of receiver

Upon delivering any wreck to the owner, or paying him the proceeds
229.
of sale pursuant to this Part, a receiver is discharged from all liability, but the
delivery  does  not  affect  any  question  that  may  be  raised  by  third  parties
concerning the wreck.

Removal of wreck in port

230.(1)
Where a vessel is sunk, stranded or abandoned in any place under the
control of the port authority or in or near any approach thereto, in such manner
as  in  the  opinion  of  the  port  authority  to  be,  or  to  be  likely  to  become,  an
obstruction or danger to navigation, the authority, may

(a)

(b)

take possession of the vessel and raise, remove or destroy the whole or
any part thereof;

light or buoy the vessel or part thereof until it is raised, removed or
destroyed; and

155

(c)

in such manner as the authority thinks fit, sell the vessel or part thereof
when so raised or removed, and also any other property recovered in
the exercise of its powers under this section.

(2)
Out of the proceeds of any sale pursuant to subsection (l), the port authority
may  reimburse  itself  for  the  expenses  incurred  by  it  in  relation  to  the  vessel
described in that subsection.

The  surplus  proceeds,  if  any,  from  the  sale  of  the  vessel  described  in
(3)
subsection (1) shall be held on deposit to pay to the persons who establish a right
to the proceeds or any part thereof.

The deposit referred to in subsection (3), is forfeited to the port authority
(4)
if the person entitled to proceeds or any part thereof fails to claim within one year
after the sale of the vessel.

When the expenses connected with the raising, removal or destruction of
(5)
a vessel described in subsection (1) exceeds the value of any property recovered,
the excess amount becomes a debt due to the port authority from the person who
was the owner of the vessel at the time it was sunk, stranded or abandoned.

Removal officer

231.(1)
Where a vessel is run aground or stranded, or is found in a dangerous
or hazardous condition, in a port under the control of the port authority, or in or
near the approaches thereto, and it appears expedient to the port authority to take
charge of the operation of refloating or removing the vessel, it may, subject to
subsection (4), appoint an officer to direct the operation.

The officer so directed is authorised to do all things that in his opinion are

(2)
necessary to refloat or remove the vessel.

The master and all persons present and belonging to the vessel shall obey
(3)
the direction of the authorised person and render him such assistance as he may
require.

An officer to be appointed under subsection (1) may only be appointed

(4)
with the approval of the Minister.

156

Removal of wreck

Where a vessel is sunk, stranded or abandoned on the coast or on or
232.
near any rock, shoal or bank in Barbados or any adjacent seas, and, in the opinion
of  the  Minister,  it  is,  or  is  likely  to  become,  an  obstruction  or  a  danger  to
navigation, the Minister has the same powers in relation to the vessel as are by
this Part conferred upon the port authority.
