HOLIDAYS WITH PAY ACT, 2017

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

The  Holidays  with  Pay  Act,  Cap.  348  came  into  operation  on  the  11th  of
January, 1952 and since that time this Act has provided paid vacations for private
sector  employees  in  Barbados.  However,  with  the  passage  of  time  it  became
apparent that this Act needed reform. This Bill will reform the law with respect
to the granting of annual holidays to employees and the calculation of the sums
to be paid to employees for their annual holidays.

Clause 1:

Clause 2:

PART I : PRELIMINARY

states the short title by which the Bill may be cited, it may be
cited as the Holidays with Pay Act, 2017.

defines the critical terms which are systematically used in the
Bill. It provides clarity and certainty of application by defining
employee and employer for the purposes of the Bill. It also
clearly  depicts  the  meaning  of  and  the  correlation  between
average pay, total remuneration, year of employment and the
granting of an annual holiday.

PART II :THE ANNUAL HOLIDAY OF AN EMPLOYEE

Clause 3:

makes it clear that the Chief Labour Officer has administrative
responsibility  for  the  Holidays  with  Pay  Act,  2017  and
provides a clear connection between the Holidays with Pay
Act, 2017, the Employment Rights Act (Act 2012 - 9 ), and the
Labour Department Act, Cap. 23.

Clause 4:

makes  provision  for  the  amount  of  holiday  which  may  be
granted to an employee; this ranges from 3 weeks to 5 week

i

Clause 5:

Clause 6:

Clause 7:

Clause 8:

Holidays with Pay Act, 2017

unless  a  longer  period  is  provided  for  in  the  contract  of
employment.  It  also  provides  for  the  manner  in  which  an
employee  can  take  his  holiday  and  provides  for  necessary
notice and dialogue an between employee and his employer
with regard to holidays granted under the Bill. It also makes
it unlawful for an employer to dismiss an employee while the
employee is on vacation.

makes  provision  for  the  calculation  of  what  an  employee
should be paid for his annual holiday. This amount will vary
depending on the amount of vacation to which the employee
is entitled, but it should not be less than the employee usually
receives  as  his  payment  in  the  general  course  of  his
employment.

makes  provision  for  a  situation  where  an  employee  is
terminated before he takes his annual holiday or part thereof,
as it provides for the automatic granting of any holiday due to
that  employee,  and  it  also  provides  for  situations  where  an
employee may have taken his annual holiday or a part thereof
in advance by providing for any payments due as result of this
to be made to the employer.

makes  provision  for  the  payment  for  any  vacation  time
accrued  by  a  person  who  has  been  employed  for  at  least  3
months but less than one year.

makes provision for the occurrence of a public holiday during
the annual holiday granted to an employee, and in light of this
occurrence the annual holiday is to be extended by one day
for each public holiday within the period, and payment would
be  in  accordance  with  the  Bill  unless  the  contract  of
employment  makes  specific  provision  for  the  payment  for
public holidays.

Clause 9:

Clause 10:

Clause 11:

Clause 12:

Clause 13:

Clause 14:

Clause 15:

Holidays with Pay Act, 2017

PART III :MISCELLANEOUS

requires  employers  to  perform  certain  duties  in  relation  to
record keeping with regard to matters under the Bill so that
the Chief Labour Officer may properly monitor that vacations
are being granted and paid in the manner required by Bill.

makes  it  clear  that  any  clause  in  a  contract  of  employment
which seeks to exclude the Holidays with Pay Act, 2017 would
be void and the Bill would still apply to the employee and the
contract of employment.

makes certain failings of an employer such as reporting, and
the  granting  of  and  payment  for  an  annual  holiday,  among
other things, an offence under the Bill.

makes  provision  for  the  Chief  Labour  Officer  to  initiate
proceedings in respect of matters under the Bill.

provides for offences under the Bill to be started within one
year from the commission of the offence.

makes  provision  for  amendment  of  the  First  Schedule  by
Order.

makes provision for all contracts of employment in existence
at the time the Bill comes into force to be saved and to be
covered by the new Bill and makes provision for offences that
may be in the process of being tried at the time this Act takes
effect.

Clause 16:

amends the Employment Rights Act (Act 2012 - 9 ) to make it
clear that Employment Rights Tribunal is empowered to deal
matters under the Holidays with Pay Act, 2017 as well as any

iii

Holidays with Pay Act, 2017

other  enactment  dealing  with  employment  standards  or
employment rights.

Clause 17:

Repeals the existing Holidays with Pay Act, Cap. 348.
