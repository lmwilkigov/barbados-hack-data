ANIMAL HEALTH AND VETERINARY PUBLIC HEALTH BILL, 2022

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

This  Bill  would  provide  for  the  establishment  of  a  Veterinary  Authority  to
regulate terrestrial and aquatic animal health in Barbados by the implementation
of  animal  health  and  animal  welfare  standards  in  accordance  with  the  World
Organization for Animal Health; and for related matters.

PART I
PRELIMINARY

Clause 1:

Clause 1 of the Bill provides for the short title.

Clause 2:

Clause 3:

Clause 2 of the Bill provides for definitions of various terms
appearing in the Bill. The terms in subsection (1) are aligned
with those included in the Glossary to the Terrestrial Animal
Health Code and the Glossary to the Aquatic Animal Health
Code.

PART II
ADMINISTRATION

Clause 3 of the Bill in sub-clause (1) establishes the Veterinary
Authority  as  the  competent  authority  for  the  regulation  of
terrestrial  and  aquatic  animal  health  in  Barbados.  It  is
important  to  note  that  the  Veterinary  Authority  is  not  an
independent agency but is intended to be a department within
the Ministry of Agriculture. Sub-clause (2) provides that the
head  of  the  Veterinary  Authority  is  the  Chief  Veterinary
Officer.

i

Clause 4:

Clause 5:

Clause 6:

Animal Health and Veterinary Public
Health Bill, 2022

Clause  4  of  the  Bill  makes  provision  for  the  post  of  Chief
Veterinary Officer and sets out the role and responsibility of
the Chief Veterinary Officer.

Clause  5  of  the  Bill  provides  for  the  functions  of  the
Veterinary Authority and removes any ambiguity regarding
the scope of responsibilities of the Veterinary Authority. This
addresses  a  major  gap  in  the  current  legislation  by
enumerating the responsibilities of the Veterinary Authority
with  respect  to  animal  health.  The  functions  listed  in  sub-
clause (3) relate to: the obligations established by the World
Organization  of  Animal  Health;  trade  (e.g.  risk  analysis,
equivalence) and other activities relevant to animal health and
welfare and veterinary public health.

Clause 6 of the Bill provides that the Minister may by order
delegate  to  the  Chief  Veterinary  Officer,  any  power  or
function conferred or imposed on him under the Act except
the power to make subsidiary legislation. This clause in sub-
clause  (2)  provides  for  the  Chief  Veterinary  Officer  to
authorize  any  public  or  private  veterinarians  or  veterinary
paraprofessional  to  perform  some  of  the  functions  of  the
Veterinary Authority. This allows the Veterinary Authority to
use veterinarians that are not part of its staff to carry out certain
tasks and to use staff of other ministries or departments (e.g.
Ministry  of  Health,  Customs  etc.)  or  private  persons.
However,  certain  functions  must  not  be  delegated,  to
guarantee  the  independence  and  impartiality  of  the  control
system.  These  exceptions  are  also  stated  in  sub-clause  (2)
which mirrors part of Article 3.4.5 of the Terrestrial Animal
Health  Code  on  delegation  of  powers.  The  exceptions  are:
functions  relating  to  official  liaison  duties  with  other
any  notification
ministries  or

authorities;

foreign

ii

Clause 7:

Animal Health and Veterinary Public
Health Bill, 2022

responsibilities  with  trading  partners;  the  approval  of
standards,  requirements,  rules  or  sanitary  measures;  or  the
designation  of  emergencies,  free  compartment  zones,  free
zones, containment zones or infected zones.

legislation

should  define

Clause  7  of  the  Bill  provides  the  foundation  for  the
establishment  of  laboratories  for  the  analysis  of  official
samples; and for validating or confirming results or the quality
control of results. This clause is directly in line with Article
3.4.7 of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code which stipulates
role,
that  veterinary
responsibilities,  obligations  and  quality  requirements  of
official laboratories, designated by the Veterinary Authority
for  carrying  out  the  analysis  of  official  samples;  and  also
laboratories  recognized  to  conduct  analyses  required  under
the legislation e.g. for the purposes of quality control. This
clause  is  sufficiently  broad  to  facilitate  the  recognition  of
public  or  private  facilities  or  even  those  located  outside  of
Barbados.  Sub-clause  (3)  establishes  the  standards  under
which  the  operation  of  official  laboratories  and  reference
laboratories is to be conducted: impartially and independently.

the

Clause 8:

Clause 9:

Clause 8 of the Bill enables the Chief Veterinary Officer with
the approval of the Minister to designate premises that meet
certain  prescribed  requirements  to  be  used  for  veterinary
purposes.  This  clause  states  that  the  designation  is  not
permanent and may be amended, cancelled or reinstated at any
time.

Clause  9  of  the  Bill  makes  provision  for  the  Veterinary
Authority to contract the services of veterinarians. Sub-clause
(2) provides that the terms and conditions of the contract are
to be determined by the Minister.

iii

Clause 10:

Animal Health and Veterinary Public
Health Bill, 2022

Clause  10  of  the  Bill  provides  for  the  appointment  of
inspectors.  Sub-clause  (2)  provides  for  the  appointment  of
inspectors in accordance with the Public Service Act, Cap. 29
and  sub-clause  (3)  makes  provision  for  the  Veterinary
Authority to employ inspectors on a contractual basis. Sub-
clause (4) makes provision that a person appointed to the post
of inspector may be removed from office in accordance with
the Public Service Act, Cap. 29 in circumstances where there
is a conflict of interest. Where a person contracted to be an
inspector has any similar conflict of interest, that person will
cease to be an inspector as a result of the termination of their
contract. In this clause the key characteristics of inspectors are
that  they  are  duly  qualified  in  terms  of  skills,  training  and
experience;  impartial,  independent  and  free  of  improper  or
undue influence or conflict of interest. Similar characteristics
can
veterinary
paraprofessionals.  This  clause  provides  that  where  an
inspector  has  any  interest  in  a  matter  or  action  of  the
Veterinary Authority, that interest is to be communicated to
the Chief Veterinary Officer. Where it is found that the interest
conflicts  with  the  impartiality  or  independence  of  the
inspector, the Chief Veterinary Officer may recommend that
the appointment of the inspector, be withdrawn.

Clause 11:

Clause 11 of the Bill provides for the issue of identification
cards  to  inspectors  and  that  inspectors  should  have  the
identification card in their which possession at all times. This
clause makes provision that an inspector is required to produce
his identification card to any relevant person.

Clause 12:

Clause 12 of the Bill provides for the Veterinary Authority to
be assessed both externally and internally. This is an important
the  Veterinary  Authority  can
mechanism  by  which

iv

Animal Health and Veterinary Public
Health Bill, 2022

periodically gauge its performance in the implementation of
the Act and in the effectiveness of the measures adopted. In
sub-clause (3), the Bill provides for collaboration between the
Veterinary  Authority  and  any  entity  responsible  for
agricultural health and food control to monitor and evaluate
the  implementation  of  the  provisions  and  based  on  the
findings, to prepare a report which is to be published in the
first instance, five years after the Act comes into force and
thereafter at intervals not exceeding 3 years.

PART III
CONTROL OF ANIMAL DISEASES AND ZOONOSES

Clause 13:

Clause 14:

Clause 13 of the Bill provides that the Veterinary Authority
is responsible for the development and maintenance of a list
of notifiable disease for both terrestrial and aquatic animals.

Clause 14 of the Bill identifies that it is the responsibility of
Veterinary  Authority  to  establish  a  surveillance  system  for
notifiable diseases or other animal diseases to demonstrate the
absence  or  distribution  of  a  disease.  This  clause  also
establishes the duty to be transparent in its management of
data as it is also the responsibility of the Veterinary Authority
to determine, report on and make available to the public the
animal  health  status  of  Barbados  with  respect  to  animal
diseases.  The  World  Organization  for  Animal  Health
encourages such surveillance systems to be developed having
regard to: the need to provide assurance of disease status for
trade  purposes;  the  resources  of  the  country;  the  financial
impact  or  threat  posed  by  the  different  diseases;  and  the
importance  of  an  industry-wide  disease  control  programme
within a country or region.

v

Clause 15:

Animal Health and Veterinary Public
Health Bill, 2022

of

and

participation

veterinarians

Clause 15 of the Bill provides that the Veterinary Authority
is  required  to  establish  an  early  detection  system  for  the
purposes  of  detecting  animal  diseases.  This  clause  is  an
extension  of  clause  14  as  some  surveillance  systems  are
established as early detection systems. Sub-clause (1) sets out
the minimum requirements for an early detection system and
also sets out that an effective detection system should involve
veterinary
the
paraprofessionals,  livestock  owners  and  other  stakeholders
involved  in  the  management  and  handling  of  terrestrial
animals; owners and operators of abattoirs; and fish inspectors
and other persons involved in the handling of aquatic animals
to detect and report, notifiable disease to report that disease to
the  Veterinary  Authority.  Sub-clause  (4)  sets  out  a  key
requirement of the Veterinary Authority as indicated in the
World  Organization  for  Animal  Health,  namely,  a  chain  of
command that is as effective as possible. A chain of command
is important not only to disease response (‘war time’) but also
to proactive disease surveillance and reporting (‘peace time’)
as well as on-going regulatory activity. The integrity of the
chain  of  command  assures  the  credibility  of  the  Veterinary
Authority and the international veterinary certificates issued
in the context of international trade.

Clause 16:

Clause 16 of the Bill provides for an inspector to take action
where a notifiable disease or an emerging disease is suspected
or  confirmed  as  immediate  steps  must  be  taken  in  order  to
prevent the spread of a notifiable or emerging disease. This
clause  together  with  clause  14,  empowers  inspectors  to  act
immediately  to  manage  potential  risks  to  health  pending
confirmation by the Chief Veterinary Officer of the presence
of a notifiable or emerging disease. The action required under
sub-clause (1) includes the issuing of a written notice to the

vi

Animal Health and Veterinary Public
Health Bill, 2022

owner or occupier of the premises. The notice should specify
the provisional measures that are to be taken to prevent the
spread  of  disease.  In  addition,  provisional  measures  may
require that the owner or occupier of the adjacent premises be
served with a written notice also specifying the provisional
measures that are to be taken. In each case, the inspector is
required  to  submit  copies  of  any  notice  issued,  to  the
Veterinary Authority which in turn is to cause an investigation
involving the collection and testing of samples. Sub-clause (3)
provides  that  where  a  notifiable  disease  or  an  emerging
disease  is  confirmed  the  Veterinary  Authority  shall  issue
written notices stipulating the measures that are to be taken
and the time within which the measures are to be implemented
to prevent the spread of disease.

Clause 17 of the Bill makes provision for an area or premises
to be declared an infected area and for that declaration to be
made by order by the Minister. Sub-clause (2) requires that
the  Chief  Veterinary  Officer  performs  certain  functions
among  which  is  to  inform  the  competent  authority  for
veterinary matters in the countries with which Barbados trades
of the status of the infected area and to suspend the issue of
veterinary  certificate  for  exports,  in  effect,  recognizing  the
obligations to trading partners.

Clause  18  of  the  Bill  seeks  to  set  out  the  conditions  under
which a declaration of an infected area is to be revoked. The
conditions are: where the Chief Veterinary Officer determines
that the circumstances that gave rise to the declaration of an
infected area are no longer present.

Clause 17:

Clause 18:

Clause 19:

Clause  19  of  the  Bill  seeks  to  provide  for  animal  disease
contingency  plans  in  relation  to  notifiable  diseases  and  the
implementation of animal disease control procedures that are

vii

Animal Health and Veterinary Public
Health Bill, 2022

consistent  with  World  Organization  for  Animal  Health
guidelines.  Sub-clause  (2)  sets  out  what  an  animal  disease
contingency plan is to be based on and what such a plan should
take account of for example, the capacity for response of the
Veterinary  Authority;  the  geographical,  ecological  and
epidemiological environments; animal production and animal
or animal products marketing practices; and any other factors
considered  necessary  to  control,  contain  or  eradicate  the
animal disease. Sub-clause (3) provides for the elements of a
contingency plan and sub-clause (4), provides the duties of
the Veterinary Authority with respect to the development of
training  programmes  to  ensure  that  there  is  capacity  for
disease  diagnosis  and  control  and  the  implementation  of
disease  simulation  exercises  to  test  the  effectiveness  of  the
contingency  plans.  This  provision  is  important  because  it
identifies the responsibility of the Veterinary Authority to lead
the response in animal health emergencies, with cooperation
from  other  authorities  for  example,  the  Police  Service,
ministries responsible for public health and the environment,
depending on the particular circumstances.

Clause  20  of  the  Bill  gives  effect  to  Article  3.4.9  of  the
Terrestrial Animal Health Code and provides for the response
of the Veterinary Authority where there is an animal disease
emergency.  As  the  powers  outlined  in  this  clause  are
significant,  it  is  important  that  the  legislation  is  clear  and
transparent  regarding  the  procedures  to  be  followed;  the
grounds on which action can be taken, and who may take that
action.  This  provision  reiterates  the  key  principles  that
measures  must  be  based  on  a  risk  assessment,  ensuring
measures  are  proportional  to  risks  and  that  measures  are
publicized widely.

Clause 20:

Clause 21:

Clause 22:

Clause 23:

Animal Health and Veterinary Public
Health Bill, 2022

Clause 21 of the Bill seeks to make provision for the Minister
on the advice of the Chief Veterinary Officer to declare by
order, a zone to be a free zone, a free compartment zone or a
containment zone. However, a declaration can only be made
if the Veterinary Authority establishes the measures to set up
the respective zones.

Clause  22  of  the  Bill  sets  out  in  broad  terms  the  scope  of
response  measures  available  to  the  Veterinary  Authority  to
control or eradicate and to prevent the introduction or spread
of  animal  diseases.  This  clause  seeks  to  implement  Article
3.4.9 of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code which stipulates
that  veterinary  legislation  should  include  general  animal
health measures applicable to all diseases. This provision does
not restrict Veterinary Authority action to notifiable diseases
but  special  or  specific  measures  could  apply  to  notifiable
diseases. This clause focuses on the different options available
to the Veterinary Authority such as disinfection, movement
control, vaccination schemes etc. This provision improves the
transparency of the Bill in furtherance of the SPS Agreement
requirements  and  World  Organization  for  Animal  Health
standards.

Clause 23 of the Bill recognizes that moving animals, animal
products or animal related items increase the risk of the spread
of  disease.  To  limit  the  risk  of  the  spread  of  a  disease,  the
Veterinary  Authority  must  have  the  power  to  restrict  the
movement of animals, animal products or other items that may
serve as disease carriers. Sub-clauses (2) to (4) enhance the
procedural guarantees and transparency of the Bill by setting
out the actions that are to be taken by an inspector if an item
that should not be moved is in fact moved. Where an animal,
animal product or animal-related item is moved, an inspector

ix

Clause 24:

Clause 25:

Clause 26:

Animal Health and Veterinary Public
Health Bill, 2022

under sub-clause (4) is required to personally serve a notice
on the owner or the person in possession, care or control of
the  animal,  animal  product  or  animal-related  item  for  the
purpose of implementing a remedy.

Clause 24 of the Bill imposes an obligation on animal keepers
who suspect that an animal in their care is suffering from a
notifiable disease, to act in a timely manner in order to prevent
the spread of the suspected disease. The two critical elements
of the obligation under this clause are: separation of the animal
from others; and immediate notification to the authorities.

Clause 25 of the Bill allows the Chief Veterinary Officer to
disinfect  premises  or  establishments  where  it  has  been
confirmed  that  a  notifiable  disease  is  present.  This  clause
provides that the Chief Veterinary Officer is empowered to
choose the disinfectant to be used and the procedure to be used
having regard for example to the nature of the premises, the
equipment; and vehicles to be treated. The technical aspects
of disinfection, such as the chemicals and process used should
be included arguably, in operational manuals.

Clause  26  of  the  Bill  empowers  an  inspector  to  cause  an
animal  infected  or  suspected  of  being  infected  with  a
notifiable disease; or has come into contact with or has been
in the same place as an animal that has a notifiable disease, to
be humanely killed in order to prevent the spread of an animal
disease. Sub-clause (2) provides for an inspector to exercise
discretion to observe and treat an animal prior to destroying
it,  for  example  removing  it  to  a  place  for  observation  and
control.

Clause 27:

Clause 27 of the Bill provides for the disposal of animals that
are killed for the purpose of diseases control as a result of an

x

Clause 28:

Animal Health and Veterinary Public
Health Bill, 2022

infection with a notifiable disease. According to sub-clause
(1) such disposal is to be done in a manner that avoids the
spread of pathogenic organisms. Sub-clause (2) stipulates that
the  destruction  and  disposal  of  an  animal  infected  with  a
notifiable disease is to be carried out as soon as is practical
and  according  to  the  direction  of  the  Veterinary  Authority.
Recognizing the risk involved, sub-clause (3) provides that
for  the  purpose  of  disposing  of  an  animal  infected  with  a
notifiable  disease,  the  Veterinary  Authority  is  required  to
collaborate with the ministries responsible for public health
and the environment and any other organization as the case
requires. Sub-clause (4) provides that the meat of an animal
infected with a notifiable disease should be regarded as not fit
for human consumption.

Clause 28 of the Bill makes provision in sub-clause (1) for the
Minister on the advice of the Chief Veterinary Officer to order
compensation  to  be  paid  to  owners  in  circumstances  for
example,  where  an  animal  has  been  destroyed  in  order  to
achieve eradication, control or prevention of the spread in or
introduction of a notifiable disease; where the owners of the
animals have complied with the order and directions of the
Veterinary  Authority;  or  otherwise  comply  with
the
requirements  of  the  Bill.  Sub-clause  (2)  provides  that
compensation  is  not  to  exceed  the  fair  market  value  of  the
animal immediately before it was destroyed. Sub-clause (3)
provides  that  the  amount  of  compensation  paid  may  be
reduced or refused where the owner of the animal is found
guilty of an offence under the Bill. In addition, sub-clause (4)
provides that an owner is not entitled to compensation where
an animal dies or is compulsorily killed while in a quarantine
station.

Clause 29:

Animal Health and Veterinary Public
Health Bill, 2022

PART IV
VETERINARY PUBLIC HEALTH

Clause 29 of the Bill provides the legal foundation for a system
for  the  control  of  veterinary  medicinal  products  (including
animal  feed  containing  veterinary  medicinal  products)  for
both aquatic and terrestrial animals. Sub-clause (1) prohibits
the  importation,  sale,  advertisement  and  distribution  of
veterinary  medicinal  products  in  Barbados  except  they  are
registered by the Veterinary Authority. Sub-clause (2) creates
an exception to sub-clause (1), providing three circumstances
under which unregistered veterinary medicinal products may
be  imported,  sold,  advertised  or  distributed  in  Barbados.
These  circumstances  are  where  there  is  an  animal  disease
emergency which justifies the importation, production or use;
the  Veterinary  Authority  recognizes  that  the  registered
veterinary medicinal products are insufficient to meet local
needs; or for the purpose of testing, trial and research. Sub-
clause  (3)  also  creates  an  exception  to  sub-clause  (1),
exempting traditional animal remedies from the requirement
of registration. Provision is also made in sub-clause (4) for the
Veterinary Authority and the ministry responsible for public
health  to  co-ordinate  the  registration  and  labelling  of
veterinary medicinal products so that the systems for which
each is responsible do not circumvent the other. Moreover, the
Food and Agricultural Organisation, World Organization for
Animal  Health  and
the  World  Health  Organisation
recommend the co-ordination of controls, including sharing
lists of approved products and dossiers on active ingredients.
Provision  is  made  in  sub-clause  (5)  for  the  Veterinary
Authority to establish standards and requirement relating inter
alia  to  the  categories  of  professionals  that  are  entitled  to
prescribe  veterinary  medicinal  products,  the  conditions  and

xii

Animal Health and Veterinary Public
Health Bill, 2022

(6)

for

in  sub-clause

the  Minister  on

the  forms  to  be  used  for  veterinary  products  and  the
distribution of veterinary medicinal products. Provision is also
made
the
recommendation of the Chief Veterinary Officer to prohibit
the  use  of  ingredients  and  substances  used  as  veterinary
medicinal  products  and
the  non-therapeutic  use  of
antimicrobials. Sub-clause (7) provides that for the purposes
of  the  Bill,  animal  feed  containing  veterinary  medicinal
products  shall  be  considered  as  a  veterinary  medicinal
product.

Clause 30:

Clause 30 of the Bill seeks to regulate ante-mortem and post-
mortem inspections at slaughterhouses to control the spread
of  animal  diseases  and  for  the  benefit  of  veterinary  public
health  by  establishing  Veterinary  Authority  control  over
facilities that are established by private operators, or by the
Veterinary Authority directly. In this clause provision is made
for the operation of slaughterhouses to fall within the ambit
of the Market and Slaughterhouses Act, Cap. 265 and further
that failure to comply with the conditions of registration may
cause operations to be suspended and in serious cases revoked
where  there  is  an  immediate  risk  to  animal,  human  or
environmental health. Sub-clauses (2) to (4) set out the basics
of  a  registration  system  for  facilities  that  are  not  publicly
operated,  and  set  out  the  safeguards  to  ensure  that  there  is
transparency  and  predictability  in  decision  making,  thus
preventing arbitrary decision-making while at the same time
allowing inspectors to shut down premises if there is a risk to
animal or human health or the environment. Sub-clause (5)
sets out a range of areas for which regulations may be made.
Sub-clause  (6)  provides  for  collaboration  between  the
Veterinary  Authority  and  the  ministry  of  responsible  for
public health to ensure that inspection systems meet public

xiii

Clause 31:

Animal Health and Veterinary Public
Health Bill, 2022

health and food safety requirements; and the Markets Division
to  ensure  that  inspections  meet  the  requirements  under  the
Market and Slaugtherhouses Act, Cap. 265.

Clause  31  of  the  Bill  seeks  to  provide  that  the  Veterinary
Authority  is  under  an  obligation  to  control  the  spread  of
animal  diseases  at  knackeries  and  rendering  facilities.
According  to  this  clause,  this  is  to  be  achieved  by
collaborating with the ministry responsible for public health
and the Markets Division of the Markets and Slaughterhouses
Act, Cap. 265.

Clause 32:

Clause  32  of  the  Bill  seeks  to  provide  that  the  Veterinary
Authority is under an obligation to prevent the introduction
and spread of zoonotic and emerging diseases.

PART V
HEALTH PROVISIONS RELATING TO ANIMAL PRODUCTION

Clause 33:

Clause 33 of the Bill is broad in its scope and in a general way
addresses all aspects of feed control. In this clause provision
is made for animal feed and animal feed ingredients to meet
safety  standards;  it  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Veterinary
Authority  to  issue  the  safety  standards.  Sub-clause  (1)
prohibits the importation, production, manufacture, sale and
distribution of feed in Barbados except it is registered by the
Veterinary Authority. Sub-clause (2) creates an exception to
sub-clause  (1),  providing  three  circumstances  under  which
unregistered  feed  may  be  imported  into  Barbados.  These
circumstances  are  where:  there  is  an  animal  disease
emergency which justifies the importation, production or use;
the Veterinary Authority recognizes that the registered animal
feed is insufficient to meet local needs; or for the purpose of
testing, trial and research. Provision is made in clause (3) for

xiv

Animal Health and Veterinary Public
Health Bill, 2022

the  Veterinary  Authority  to  makes  regulations  to  establish
standards  and  requirements  relating  inter  alia  to,  the
ingredients and composition of animal feed, the production,
manufacture,  importation  and  exportation  of  animal  feed.
Sub-clause  (4)  prohibits  the  use  of  animal  feed  and  animal
feed ingredients in food for human consumption unless they
meet the safety standards issued by the Veterinary Authority.
Provision  is  made  in  sub-clause  (5)  for  the  collaboration
between
the  ministry
responsible for food safety to set the limits and tolerance levels
for  biological,  chemical  or  physical  hazards  in  animal  feed
and feed ingredients.

the  Veterinary  Authority  and

Clause 34 of the Bill provides that the Veterinary Authority
is responsible for establishing a system to identify and trace
certain species of animals, to be provided for in regulations.
According to sub-clause (2), the Veterinary Authority should
collaborate  with  the  ministry  responsible  for  health  when
developing traceability systems for foods of animal origin, as
required for food safety purposes. Important considerations in
the  development  of  the  system  include:  ensuring  the
confidentiality of information collected; and ensuring that the
information  is  used  for  the  specified  purposes  i.e.  animal
health and production and human health. It is not to be used
for other purposes, such as taxation and levies.

Clause  35  of  the  Bill  seeks  to  provide  that  the  Veterinary
Authority is responsible for the establishment of conditions
and requirements governing the reproduction of animals. The
objective of this provision is to create a framework to prevent
the spread of pathogenic micro-organisms.

Clause 34:

Clause 35:

Clause 36:

Clause 37:

Animal Health and Veterinary Public
Health Bill, 2022

PART VI
IMPORT, EXPORT AND TRANSIT

Clause  36  of  the  Bill  provides  for  the  establishment  of
standards and requirements for the provision and maintenance
of  facilities  to  accommodate  inspections  of  animals  and
related products at the designated ports of entry. Through this
provision, whether the owner of a facility is public or private,
the required space and furnishings must be provided to enable
the Veterinary Authority to carry out its functions. Sub-clause
(3) allows for the Minister to serve a notice to the owner or
operator of an inspection facility of desired improvements to
an inspection facility where that facility does not comply with
the established standards and requirements. An exception is
made where the inspection is conducted at a private residence.
In  that  case  the  Minister  has  no  jurisdiction  to  cause  any
improvements to be made.

Clause 37 of the Bill identifies designated ports of entry as the
only  points  at  which  an  animal,  animal  product  or  animal-
related item is to enter Barbados. Sub-clause (2) prohibits the
importation  of  an  animal,  animal  product  or  animal-related
item that does not comply with the provisions of the import
permit  issued  by  the  Veterinary  Authority  and  is  not
accompanied by an international veterinary certificate or any
other document which is required by the Veterinary Authority,
a  provision  which  recognizes  that  not  all  items  require  a
veterinary certificate and gives the Veterinary Authority the
flexibility to accept an alternative document. Sub-clause (3)
allows the Minister to prohibit the importation of an animal,
animal  product  or  animal-related  item  to  prevent  the
introduction  or  spread  of  any  vector,  pathogen,  disease  or
toxic  substance.  Sub-clause  (4)  places  an  obligation  on  the

xvi

Clause 38:

Clause 39:

Animal Health and Veterinary Public
Health Bill, 2022

Veterinary Authority, based on a risk analysis, to develop and
maintain a list of animals and animal products the importation
of which is to be restricted or prohibited on the basis of their
own decision or that of an international agreement. Sub-clause
(5) provides the penalty for not complying with the provisions
of this clause.

Clause 38 of the Bill provides in sub-clause (1), the documents
that  are  required  to  import  an  animal,  animal  product  or
animal-related item into Barbados. They are an international
veterinary certificate, an import permit or approval in writing
from the Veterinary Authority. Sub-clause (2) provides that
the  lists  of  animals  and  animal  products  that  require  an
international  veterinary  certificate  or  import  permit  and
animal-related items are to be prescribed by order to facilitate
and  control  entry  of  different  types  of  animals,  animal
products and animal related items. Sub-clause (2) creates a
distinction for animal-related items that would not be subject
to an import permit and recognizes that because they can serve
as a disease pathway, that control is necessary. Sub-clause (3)
reflects the obligations under the SPS Agreement, that import
requirements are to be based on international standards or a
science-based  risk  assessment.  Also  important  is  that  the
clause provides that the Veterinary Authority is to keep import
requirements under review. Sub-clause (4) makes provision
for the making of various import requirements regulations.

Clause 39 of the Bill provides that where an import permit is
required,  an  application  is  to  be  made  to  the  Veterinary
Authority. There is a fee attached. Sub-clause (4) provides that
the  Veterinary  Authority  is  required  to  have  regard  for  the
import requirements when evaluating an application. This is
important for the transparency and predictability of the permit

xvii

Clause 40:

Clause 41:

Animal Health and Veterinary Public
Health Bill, 2022

issuance process to reduce the likelihood of arbitrary decision
making. Sub-clause (5) establishes the duty of the Veterinary
Authority to keep records of applications and the issuance of
import permits.

Clause 40 of the Bill places the obligation on the importer to
inform the Veterinary Authority in advance of the arrival of
animals, animal products or animal related items.

Clause  41  of  the  Bill  seeks  to  makes  provision  for  the
mandatory  inspections  at  designated  ports  of  entry.  Sub-
clause (2) is a practical measure that allows for inspections to
take place in facilities other than quarantine stations or border
inspection facilities, where such places have prior approval
from  the  Veterinary  Authority.  Sub-clause  (3)  makes
provision for the place and times for which an inspection may
take place, either at a designated port of entry during regular
business  hours  or,  with  the  approval  of  the  Veterinary
Authority,  at  the  port  of  final  destination.  Sub-clause  (4)
allows  for  animal-related  items  that  do  not  require  prior
written  approval  to  be  submitted  for  inspection  at  the
designated  ports  of  entry.  Sub-clause  (5)  provides  for  an
inspector  to  release  an  animal,  animal  product  or  animal-
related item for clearance to a customs officer or the importer
or person in charge of the shipment where it is found not to
pose a risk for the introduction and spread of disease. This
clause  also  prevents  a  customs  officer  from  releasing  an
animal,  animal  product  or  animal  related  item  without  the
approval of the Veterinary Authority. Sub-clause (7) specifies
that  a  written  notice  should  normally  be  provided  to  the
importer, but if urgent action is required, the inspector may
take  any  required  action  and  notify  the  importer  after  such
action  has  been  taken.  Sub-clause  (8)  provides  that  an

xviii

Animal Health and Veterinary Public
Health Bill, 2022

inspector may forego the required notice and apply any of the
measures provided for in sub-clause (7). This sub-clause also
imposes the duty on the inspector to inform the importer in
writing of the reasons why notice was not given. Sub-clause
(9) makes clear provisions for the destruction of shipments
that are not claimed. Sub- clause (10) is a reiteration of the
principle that all actions should be based on an assessment of
disease  risks.  Sub-clause  (11)  is  important  to  protect  the
Veterinary Authority from liability for actions taken in good
faith to prevent the introduction and spread of diseases into
Barbados.

Clause 42 of the Bill provides that the cost of the care and
welfare of any animal subject to a pre-shipment inspection and
any  measures  applied  by  an  inspector  in  the  course  of  an
inspection of an imported animal, animal product or animal-
related item suspected of posing a risk of the introduction and
spread of disease is to be borne by the importer.

Clause 43 of the Bill provides for the Veterinary Authority to
determine  with  an  exporting  country  any  arrangements
relating to pre-shipment inspections and the equivalence of
animal health measures. This is an important principle of the
SPS Agreement and is designed to facilitate trade, where the
Veterinary  Authority  recognizes  the  measures  taken  by  its
trading  partners,  offer  the  same  protection  as  its  own
measures. Article 5.3 of both the Terrestrial Animal Health
Code and the Aquatic Animal Health Code devotes significant
attention to the concept of making equivalence judgments.

Clause 44 of the Bill seeks to provide the circumstances under
which an inspector may refuse entry to an animal or animal-
related  item  which  is  suspected  of  being  infected  with  a
notifiable  disease  or  other  infectious  disease.  In  addition,

xix

Clause 42:

Clause 43:

Clause 44:

Clause 45:

Clause 46:

Animal Health and Veterinary Public
Health Bill, 2022

provision is made for the procedures which an inspector must
follow  in  circumstances  where  the  suspected  disease  is
capable  of  being  treated.  Provision  is  also  made  for  the
circumstances in which an animal or animal related item may
be seized and disposed.

Clause  45  of  the  Bill  corresponds  to  Chapter  5.5  of  the
Terrestrial  Animal  Health  Code  and  Chapter  5.7  of  the
Aquatic Animal Health Code and sets out the procedures for
applying to the Veterinary Authority for a transit permit. Sub-
clause (5) contributes to the predictability and clarity of the
system by enumerating the actions that can be taken and the
grounds for doing so to verify the health status of an animal,
animal product or animal- related item. Transit may be denied,
for example if certain diseases exist in the exporting country,
or in a transit country which precedes it in the itinerary; or if
on arrival, an inspection shows that the animal is affected by
a notifiable disease. Sub-clause (6) provides that an owner or
person  in  charge  of  the  animal,  animal  product  or  animal-
related item is not to be compensated where any measure is
applied. Sub-clause (7) places an obligation on the captain of
a vessel carrying animals, animal products or animal-related
items to comply with prescribed by the Veterinary Authority
where the vessel stops in a port in Barbados or transits through
a port in Barbados to a port outside Barbados.

Clause 46 of the Bill empowers public officers other than the
Veterinary Authority to detain imports of prescribed products,
and to inform the Veterinary Authority of their arrival to the
country as soon as possible. An item detained by any of the
persons listed in sub-clause (1) is to be treated as an action on
the  behalf  of  the  Veterinary  Authority  and  the  item  to  be

xx

Clause 47:

Clause 48:

Animal Health and Veterinary Public
Health Bill, 2022

detained is to be conveyed to the Veterinary Authority within
3 days.

Clause 47 of the Bill seeks to provide for the conditions and
requirements relating to the issue of a veterinary certificate.
Sub-clause (1) prohibits the exportation of an animal product
or animal-related item from a place other than a designated
port of exit and without a veterinary certificate issued by the
Veterinary Authority. In sub-clause (2) provision is made for
mandatory  inspections  as  a  condition  to  the  issue  of  a
veterinary certificate for export. Sub-clause (3) provides that
the  Veterinary  Authority  in  the  course  of  an  inspection  is
required to consider the requirements of the importing country
and  should  not  issue  a  veterinary  certificate  if  the  animal,
animal  product  or  animal  related  item  does  not  meet  the
requirements of the importing country. In addition, provision
is  made  for  an  exporter  to  remedy  any  instances  of  non-
compliance with the requirements of an importing country by
subjecting the animal, animal product or animal-related item
to treatment in order to comply with the requirements of the
importing  country.  Sub-clause  (4)  provides  factors  that  the
Veterinary  Authority  considers  in  determining  whether  to
issue an international veterinary certificate.

Clause 48 of the Bill makes provisions for quarantine stations
for terrestrial animals and is aligned with Chapter 5.6 of the
Terrestrial  Animal  Health  Code,  in  particular  Article  5.6.2.
This  clause  provides  that  quarantine  stations  should  be
recommended by the Chief Veterinary Officer and designated
by  the  Minister.  While  a  quarantine  station  is  most  likely
public,  the  wording  of  the  clause  allows  for  flexibility  to
designate  private  facilities  that  meet  prescribed  standards
either as a permanent quarantine facility or on a temporary or

xxi

Animal Health and Veterinary Public
Health Bill, 2022

restricted basis. The key elements of this clause are that these
facilities are to meet prescribed standards and are to be under
the oversight or supervision of the Veterinary Authority even
if the day-to-day operations are contracted or assigned to the
private sector.

Clause 49 of the Bill applies only to terrestrial animals. Sub-
clause (1) sets out the grounds for which an animal may be
placed in quarantine. Those grounds are: for the purpose of
trade;  or  where  an  inspector  has  reason  to  believe  that  an
animal  while  being  transported  may  be  suffering  from  a
notifiable  disease  or  other  contagious  animal  disease;  may
have  been  in  contact  with  an  animal  which  is  or  may  be
suffering from a notifiable disease or other contagious disease
or one whose disease status is unknown; or has otherwise been
exposed  to  the  risk  of  contracting  a  notifiable  or  other
contagious disease. Sub-clause (2) empowers an inspector to
either  seize  and  detain,  destroy  or  otherwise  dispose  of  an
animal  if  that  animal  is  removed  from  quarantine  without
written authorization. Sub-clause (3) empowers an inspector
to  destroy  an  animal  as  a  result  of  specific  causes  listed
without payment of compensation to the owner and sub-clause
(4) reiterates the right of the Veterinary Authority to impose
quarantine as an import condition.

Clause 50 of the Bill seeks to protect the welfare and safety
of  animals  and  to  prevent  the  spread  of  disease  by  making
provision  for  the  Veterinary  Authority  to  regulate  the
conditions under which animals are transported by vehicles.

Clause  51  of  the  Bill  seeks  to  provide  for  the  methods
available  to  the  Veterinary  Authority  to  dispose  of  waste
arising from foods of animal origin, animal-related items or
other items associated with the transport of animals aboard a

xxii

Clause 49:

Clause 50:

Clause 51:

Animal Health and Veterinary Public
Health Bill, 2022

vehicle coming into Barbados. This clause provides that the
waste may be destroyed at the expense of the importer at the
port of entry; reshipped to the country of origin, at the expense
of the importer or denied entry into Barbados; the method will
be determined based on the requirements established by the
Veterinary Authority.

PART VII
ANIMAL WELFARE

Clause 52 of the Bill prohibits the mistreatment of and cruelty
to animals and in particular prohibits an owner of an animal
from allowing a third party to cause suffering to an animal.
This provision is primarily directed at terrestrial animals. Sub-
clause (3) provides the penalty for torturing, beating, injuring,
mutilating,  neglecting,  cruelly  treating  any  animal  or
overloading any working animal.

Clause 53 of the Bill seeks to make provision for the welfare
of terrestrial animals. Sub-clause (1) is aligned with Article
7.1.2 of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code, which contains
guiding  principles  for  animal  welfare,  including  the  “five
freedoms”  which  are  stated  at  paragraph  (a)  to  (e)  of  sub-
clause (1). Sub-clause (2) makes provision for the Veterinary
Authority  to  prescribe  animal  welfare  standards  and  aligns
with  chapter  7  of  the  Terrestrial  Animal  Health  Code.  The
standards relating to animal welfare are extensive and include:
farms, transportation, slaughter and production

Clause  54  of  the  Bill  seeks  to  make  provision  for  the
Veterinary  Authority  to  prescribe  aquatic  animal  welfare
standards for farmed fish. The welfare standards for farmed
fish  included  in  this  clause  relate  to  aquaculture  facilities;
transportation; killing of farmed fish for human consumption

xxiii

Clause 52:

Clause 53:

Clause 54:

Health Bill, 2022

or  to  control  disease;  research  and  testing,  recreation,
entertainment and companionship.

PART VIII
MANAGEMENT OF STRAY ANIMALS

Clause 55 of the Bill allows for the Veterinary Authority to
ensure that stray animals do not spread diseases and do not
become a public nuisance or hazard. Sub-clause (3) requires
co-operation  among  different  stakeholders  for  the  proper
implementation  of  this  clause.  The  Veterinary  Authority
should work in cooperation with other agencies, the private
sector  to  establish  programmes.  Article  7.7.4  expressly
recognizes the role of other authorities in collaborating with
the Veterinary Authority in the implementation of programs.
Article  7.7.3  guides  what  the  objectives  are  of  a  control
program  and  article  7.7.6  sets  out  control  measures.  The
control  of  stray  livestock  may  be  a  responsibility  of  the
Veterinary  Authority,  insofar  as  this  relates  to  control  of
livestock diseases.

PART IX
ENFORCEMENT

Clause 56 of the Bill is an extensive and important provision
which  seeks  to  provide  robust  powers  to  inspectors  in
accordance with Article 3.4.5 of the Terrestrial Animal Health
Code.  The  powers  listed  are  extensive  but  necessary  for
inspectors to carry out their duties inter alia stopping the sale
and distribution of animals and animal products. It is to be
borne in mind that the robust powers granted to inspectors are
to  protect  the  rights  of  stakeholders  and  the  general  public
against any abuse of authority Sub-clause (4) indicates that

xxiv

Animal Health and Veterinary Public
Health Bill, 2022

dwelling  places  are  excluded  (on  Constitutional  grounds)
unless an inspector obtains a warrant, and sub-clause (5) is an
additional safeguard for the public by requiring all inspectors
to identify themselves and show their identification card, and
importantly  not  disclose  any  confidential  information.
Recognizing  the  risks  that  may  be  associated  with  entering
and searching premises, provision is made in sub-clause (6)
for a member of the Police Service to accompany an inspector
in the execution of his duties.

Clause 57 of the Bill provides for the guiding principles on
which  measures  and  requirements  should  be  based.  This
clause seeks to incorporate Articles 2.2, 3 and 5 of the SPS
Agreement, to establish the basis on which sanitary measures
are developed and implemented in Barbados. Sub-clause (1)
lists  that  measures  are  to  be  harmonized  with  international
standards, technically based on risk assessments and science-
based  decisions;  be  favourable  to  the  development  of
regionalization; be favourable to trade and proportionate to
the risk. These principles must directly inform and shape the
measures that are implemented under the Bill. Sub-clause (2)
places the obligation on the Veterinary Authority to keep the
measures under review every 3 years to ensure they are current
with frequently evolving international standards.

Clause  58  of  the  Bill  empowers  inspectors  to  issue  written
notices  setting  out  the  grounds  for  which  corrective  action
must  be  taken  and  the  time  period  for  complying  with  the
order.  Ensuring  that  this  is  done  in  writing  protects  the
individual against whom the notice is written and ensures the
specific  date  is  captured.  Manuals  and  Standard  Operating
Procedures can further detail the specifics that must be set out
in the written notice. However, the latter is provided for in

xxv

Clause 57:

Clause 58:

Clause 59:

Clause 60:

Clause 61:

Animal Health and Veterinary Public
Health Bill, 2022

paragraph (d) of sub-clause (1) where a notice serves to inform
the violator of the facts, the date and nature of the offence and
the assessed sanction. Notice is served prior to the imposition
of  a  penalty  so  as  to  afford  the  accused  a  reasonable
opportunity  to  object,  either  in  writing  or  in  person.  In
addition, an offender is granted the right to appeal a decision
under clause 62.

Clause 59 of the Bill reiterates some of the powers set out in
the foregoing clauses. This clause seeks to allow an inspector
to direct the owner of the animal, animal product or animal-
related item to move it to a place specified by the inspector
and  gives  the  inspector  an  alternative  option  to  directly
confiscate the item.

Clause 60 of the Bill seeks to prohibit any person whose item
is  confiscated  or  detained  by  an  inspector,  to  attempt  to
recover or move the item in a manner contrary to the written
authority of the Veterinary Authority.

Clause 61 of the Bill seeks to make provision for the detention
and disposal of animals, animal products and animal-related
items.  Where  an  animal,  animal  product  or  animal-related
item  is  seized  and  detained  by  an  inspector,  sub-clause  (1)
requires  that  the  Veterinary  Authority  returns  the  animal,
animal product or animal-related item where it is found that
the provisions of the Bill are not breached and that there is no
risk of the spread of disease. This creates a safeguard for the
public not to have an item detained without cause and also
protects the Veterinary Authority when having to dispose of
items that are not in compliance with the Bill. In addition, sub-
clause (2) provides that where an animal, animal product or
animal-related  item  is  seized  and  detained,  the  Veterinary
Authority  has  the  power  to  institute  proceedings  to  sell  or

xxvi

Clause 62:

Animal Health and Veterinary Public
Health Bill, 2022

destroy  that  animal  or  animal-related  item  if  the  owner  or
person in charge of the item cannot be identified. The time-
frame  within  which  the  Veterinary  Authority  may  institute
proceedings is to be prescribed by regulations. Sub-clause (3)
allows  the  Veterinary  Authority  to  dispose  an  animal  or
animal product to prevent the possible spread of disease and
sub-clause  (4)  allows  for  the  sale  or  destruction  of  an
unclaimed animal where the Authority serves notice on the
owner to claim the animal.

Clause 62 of the Bill makes provision for a two-tier system of
review where any person is aggrieved by a decision or action
taken by an inspector or an official analyst. In the first instance
an  aggrieved  person  may  appeal  in  writing  to  the  Chief
Veterinary  Officer  within  7  days  of  any  decision  or  action
taken.  Sub-clause  (2)  provides  that  the  Chief  Veterinary
Officer  is  required  to  give  a  decision  on  technical  matters
within  14  days  after  receiving  the  appeal.  Sub-clause  (3)
provides that an appeal of an action or a decision of the Chief
Veterinary Officer is to be made to the Minister within 7 days
after the decision. According to sub-clause (4) the Minister’s
decision is to be given within 14 days of receiving the appeal.
In addition, sub-clause (5) provides that an aggrieved person
may appeal to a Judge in Chambers from a decision given by
the Chief Veterinary Officer or the Minister, on a matter of
law. Sub-clause (6) requires that the Chief Veterinary Officer
acts in a timely manner in responding to a appeal involving a
notifiable disease.

PART X
OFFENCES AND PENALTIES

Clause 63 of the Bill seeks to list the specific actions that are
to  be  treated  as  criminal  offences  and  the  corresponding
penalties. The penalties range from a fine of $100 000 to $200
000 or to imprisonment for a term of 2 years or to both. Under
this clause, offences are to be tried summarily.

Clause 64 of the Bill lists the categories of behaviour that are
to be treated as offences for an inspector, official analyst or
other  official  of  the  Veterinary  Authority,  where  that
behaviour  is  outside  of  their  authority.  These  behaviours
include a failure to take action, as well as more specifically,
abuse of power, taking bribes, failing to disclose a financial
interest.  Sub-clause  (3)  provides  the  penalties  to  which  an
inspector, official analyst or other official of the Veterinary
Authority
ineligible  for  reappointment  or
disciplinary action under the Public Service Act, Cap. 29.

is  subject:

Clause 65 of the Bill makes provision for how contraventions
of the provisions of the Bill are to be treated. Under this clause,
an  inspector  is  under  an  obligation  to  inform  the  Chief
Veterinary Officer where he reasonably believes that there has
been a contravention. Sub-clause (2) provides that the Chief
Veterinary Officer may determine whether the contravention
warrants  criminal  prosecution,  an  administrative  penalty  or
both.

to

issue  administrative  penalty  notices

Clause  66  of  the  Bill  seeks  to  provide  for  the  Veterinary
Authority
in
circumstances where it is satisfied that the act which a person
has  committed  does  not  warrant  criminal  prosecution.  An
administrative penalty provides an enforcement mechanism,

xxviii

Animal Health and Veterinary Public
Health Bill, 2022

which can be more cost-effective, timely and practical than
criminal  penalties.  Sub-clause  (1)  provides  the  following
forms of penalties: the suspension or revocation of any permit
or  other  authorization;  the  suspension  or  closure  of  the
operations of an establishment; the seizure or confiscation of
an  animal,  animal  product  or  animal-related  item.  In  these
circumstances sub-clause (2) makes provision for an inspector
to  issue  an  administrative  penalty  notice,  setting  out  the
reasons for the sanction and an obligation to pay a fine not
exceeding $10 000. Sub-clause (3) makes provision for appeal
where a person to whom an administrative penalty notice is
addressed  and  who  wishes  to  challenge  the  notice.  Sub-
clauses (4) makes provision for the revocation of a business
licence  in  cases  of  repeated  violations.  Sub-clause  (5)
provides  that  where  a  person  fails  to  comply  with  the
provisions  of  an  administrative  notice  and  that  failure  to
comply results in the spread of disease or poses a serious risk
to  the  animal  health  status  of  Barbados,  that  establishment
may be closed or any licence issued may be cancelled.

Clause  67  of  the  Bill  sets  out  the  matters  that  the  Chief
Veterinary Officer may settle administratively and includes
the  seizure  of  animals,  animal  products  or  animal-related
items and the restoration of anything seized under the Bill.

Clause 68 of the Bill provides for the issue of fixed penalty
notices for offences prescribed in regulations as fixed penalty
offences. Sub-clause (2) provides the maximum penalty for a
fixed penalty offence. Sub-clause (3) sets out the procedure
for the issue of a fixed penalty notice. Sub-clause (4) describes
the consequences where a person to whom a notice is issued,
pays the fine or fails to pay the fine. Sub-clause (5) describes
the form of and particulars to be contained in a fixed penalty

Clause 67:

Clause 68:

Animal Health and Veterinary Public
Health Bill, 2022

notice.  Sub-clause  (6)  makes  provision  for  the  Chief
Veterinary Officer to extend the period for the payment of the
fixed  penalty  notice.  Sub-clause  (7)  provides  that  fixed
penalty notices are to be treated in the same way as an offence
for summary conviction for which no conviction is recorded.

Clause 69 of the Bill provides that in any prosecution for an
offence  under  the  Bill,  matters  that  are  certified  by  the
Veterinary Authority or other public official, shall be taken as
prima facie evidence of the matters stated therein unless there
is  evidence  or  grounds  to  believe  that  such  matters  are
inaccurate or false and are inadmissible in evidence.

Clause  70  of  the  Bill  seeks  to  protect  certain  officers  and
functionaries from actions that are taken in good faith and on
a scientific basis where an animal, animal product or animal-
related item is destroyed for the purposes of preventing the
introduction or spread of disease in the country.

Clause 71 of the Bill provides that a member of staff of the
Veterinary  Authority,  inspector,  official  laboratory  or  any
other entity involved in phytosanitary matters is not liable to
a civil suit or to prosecution for anything done in good faith
while performing their functions set out in the Bill.

Clause of 72 the Bill provides that unpaid administrative fines
will be treated as a debt to the State and may be recovered as
a debt due to the State in civil proceedings before a magistrate
for District “A”.

Clause 73 of the Bill makes provisions for persons who are
not attorneys-at-law, namely an inspector or any other officer
of  the  Veterinary  Authority  to  prosecute  or  conduct
proceedings.

Clause 74:

Animal Health and Veterinary Public
Health Bill, 2022

Clause 74 of the Bill seeks to provide that where a person is
convicted of an offence, the Court may order that any item
used in the perpetration of that offence may be forfeited to the
Crown in addition to any penalty imposed under sub-clause
(2) provided that where a fine is imposed, the animal, animal
product or animal-related item may be detained until the fine
is paid ; sold in satisfaction of the fine or destroyed. Sub-clause
(3) provides that in the case of an animal, the owner or person
in charge is liable for the cost associated with the welfare, food
and shelter of the animal while it is detained by the Veterinary
Authority  which  shifts  the  burden  from  the  Veterinary
Authority. Sub-clause (4) provides that where forfeiture is not
ordered,  that  the  animal,  animal  product  or  animal-related
item  is  to  be  returned  to  the  owner  and  where  it  has  been
disposed, the proceeds realised from the disposition are to be
transferred  to  the  owner  or  person  in  charge  of  the  animal,
animal  product  or  animal-related  item.  Sub-clause  (5)
provides  that  the  Veterinary  Authority  is  responsible  for
determining  the  conditions  under  which  an  animal,  animal
product  or  animal-related  item  is  to  be  held  prior  to  the
Magistrate’s ruling. This is an important provision to ensure
that any goods that may carry disease are treated in a manner
that does not increase the risk of spread of that disease.

PART XI
MISCELLANEOUS

to collaborate and co-operate with the Veterinary Authority
in  the  execution  of  their  duties.  Sub-clauses  (1)  and  (2)
