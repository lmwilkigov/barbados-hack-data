30.(1)

Notwithstanding section 28(3), the Director may

(a)

suspend the licence of a service provider

from the date of the institution of criminal proceedings against the
service provider for an offence referred to in section 28(1) or at
any time thereafter; or

conviction to a fine of $50 000 or to imprisonment for 2 years or to both.

In  criminal  proceedings  pursuant  to  section  6  and  subsection  (1),  the

absence of the name of the person charged from a list of licensees in any register
to be kept pursuant to section 33 is prima facie evidence that the person is not a
licensee.
