(b)

Part  I  of  the  Second  Schedule,  shall  file  his  declaration  with  the
Commission;

the income, assets and liabilities of the specified person in public life;
and

the income, assets and liabilities of his spouse and dependent children.

A declaration may be accompanied, where a specified person in public life
(6)
so  desires,  by  a  statement  giving  details  of  his  income,  assets  and  liabilities
certified by an accountant.

Where a specified person in public life dies, there is no obligation on the
(7)
personal representative of his estate to file the declaration which the specified
person in public life would have been required to file had he lived.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Part applies to a person who ceases to be

a specified person in public life but is required to file a declaration pursuant to
subsection (1)(c) as it applies to any other specified person in public life.

The President has, in respect of a specified person in public life who is
(9)
required  to  file  a  declaration  with  him  and  any  declaration  so  filed,  the  same
functions that the Commission has in this Act in respect of a specified person in
public life who is required to file a declaration with it and any declaration so filed.

19

Full disclosure

A specified person in public life shall disclose in his declaration such
12.
details in respect of his income, assets and liabilities and those of his spouse and
dependent children as, by the exercise of reasonable care, should be known to
him including

(a)

(b)

any benefit accruing to his income and assets and those of his spouse
and dependent children; and

any  income,  assets  and  liabilities  acquired,  held  or  incurred  by  any
other  person  as  agent  or  on  behalf  of  himself  and  his  spouse  and
dependent children or any of them.

Trust property

Where  a  specified  person  in  public  life  holds  any  money  or  other
13.
property in trust for a person who is not his spouse or child or another specified
person in public life, he shall so state in his declaration but he shall not be required
to disclose the terms of the trust.

Blind trusts

14.(1)
A specified person in public life may place all or part of his assets in
a blind trust for the purpose of this Act and upon doing so, where his office is
listed in

(a)

(b)

Part I of the Second Schedule, he shall file a copy of the trust deed with
the Commission;

Part II of the Second Schedule, he shall file a copy of the trust deed
with the President.

Where the Commission or the President, as the case may be, has reasonable
(2)
grounds to believe that a specified person in public life who is required to file a

20

declaration is likely to contravene or has contravened the Code of Conduct, the
Commission or the President may direct the person to

(a)

place all or part of his assets in a blind trust on such terms and conditions
as are considered appropriate; and

(b)

file a copy of the trust deed in accordance with subsection (1).

Where a specified person in public life places assets in a blind trust, he
(3)
shall not be required to provide in his declaration more particulars of the assets
than the amount and description of the assets and the date on which they were
placed in the trust.

Notwithstanding any other law relating to the duties of trustees, a qualified
(4)
trust company which manages the assets of a specified person in public life by
way of a blind trust shall reply fully to any inquiries of the Commission or the
President, as the case may be, relating to the nature and management of the assets.

A blind trust is created where a specified person in public life enters into

(5)
an agreement with a qualified trust company whereby

(a)

(b)

(c)

all or any part of his assets or those of his spouse or his children are
conveyed  to  the  qualified  trust  company  for  the  management,
administration  and  control  thereof  in  its  absolute  discretion  without
recourse or report to the person beneficially entitled to the assets;

income derived from the management of the assets is to be distributed,
in accordance with the agreement, to him, his spouse or his children
until he ceases to be a specified person in public life; and

after he ceases to be a specified person in public life, proper and full
accounting  is  to  be  made  to  him,  his  spouse  or  his  children  as  the
circumstances of the management of the trust require.

21

mentioned  in  subparagraph  (i)  controls  the  corporation,  its
holding corporation or a corporation affiliated with either.

Examination of declarations

15.(1)
The Commission shall examine every declaration it receives in order
to determine whether the declaration is a complete and accurate statement of the
financial affairs of the specified person in public life who filed it.

22

(2)

Where the Commission

(a)

is satisfied that the declaration

(i)

has been fully made and all questions satisfactorily answered; or

(ii)

is  incomplete  but  the  specified  person  in  public  life  cannot
reasonably obtain the information required to complete it,

the  Commission  shall  forward  to  the  specified  person  in  public  life  a
certificate of compliance in the Form 2 set out in the Third Schedule and, at
the request of the person, publish a statement regarding its satisfaction with
the declaration in the Official Gazette and in a daily newspaper in general
circulation in Barbados; or

is not satisfied with any aspect of the declaration, the Commission may
report the matter to the appropriate Service Commission, board or other
authority and to the Director of Public Prosecutions, setting out such
details as it considers appropriate.

Where  a  person  who  is  required  to  file  a  declaration  with  the
Commission  in  accordance  with  this  Part  or  to  furnish  particulars  or  other
information or documents to the Commission in accordance with section 31 fails
to do so, the Commission shall

(a)

(b)

publish that fact in the Official Gazette and in a daily newspaper in
general circulation in Barbados; and

report the matter to the appropriate Service Commission, board or other
authority and to the Director of Public Prosecutions, setting out such
details as it considers appropriate.

Subsection (1)(a) does not apply to a specified person in public life who

(2)
holds an office set out in Part II of the Second Schedule.

23

A person who, without reasonable cause

(a)

(b)

fails to file a declaration that he is required to file; or

fails to comply with a direction given under section 14(2) within the

public  life  has  acquired  a  prohibited  interest  where  the  person  notifies  the

is  unlikely  to  affect  the  person’s  obligations  under  the  Code  of
Conduct; or

(9)

PART VIII

INVESTIGATIONS

Powers of Investigative Officers

Power of arrest

An investigative officer has, in carrying out his functions, the powers
41.(1)
of a constable to arrest any person whom he reasonably suspects has committed
an offence punishable by imprisonment under this Act or any other enactment
that assigns responsibility for investigations to the Commission.

An investigative officer shall, after making an arrest, deliver the person
(2)
arrested to the custody of a member of the Police Force who shall immediately
bring the person before a magistrate.

Disclosure orders

Where on an application made by an investigative officer, a Judge in
42.(1)
Chambers is satisfied that each of the requirements set out in subsection (3) is
fulfilled, the judge may make an order authorizing the officer to give to any person
the  officer  considers  has  relevant  information,  notice  in  writing  requiring  the
person, with respect to any matter relevant to the investigation for the purposes
of which the order is sought, to

(a)

(b)

(c)

answer any question, either at a time and place specified in the notice
or at once;

provide  any  information  specified  in  the  notice,  by  a  time  and  in  a
manner so specified;

produce any document specified or described in the notice, either by a
time and in a manner so specified or at once.

An application for a disclosure order shall be made without notice and shall
(2)
state that a person specified in the application is subject to an investigation under

40

this Act or any other enactment that assigns responsibility for investigations to
the Commission.

The requirements referred to in subsection (1) are that there are reasonable

(3)
grounds for

(a)

suspecting that the person specified in the application has committed
an  offence  under  this  Act  or  any  other  enactment  that  assigns
responsibility for the investigation of offences to the Commission; and

(b)

believing that

(i)

(ii)

information which may be provided in compliance with the order
is likely to be of substantial value, whether or not by itself, to the
investigation for the purposes of which the order is sought; and

it is in the public interest for the information to be provided, having
regard  to  the  benefit  likely  to  accrue  to  the  investigation  if  the
information is obtained.

A person is not bound to comply with a requirement imposed by a notice
(4)
given under a disclosure order unless evidence of authority to give the notice is
produced to him.

(5)

A person who

(a)

(b)

without reasonable excuse, fails to comply with a requirement imposed

offender is an individual;

(b)

a fine of $50 000, where the offender is a body corporate.

requirement imposed by a disclosure order may not be used in evidence against
the person in criminal proceedings.

(8)

Subsection (7) does not apply in the case of

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

proceedings for contempt of court;

a prosecution for an offence under subsection (6);

a prosecution for an offence under the Perjury Act, Cap. 142; or

a prosecution for another offence where, in giving evidence, the person
makes  a  statement  inconsistent  with  the  statement  mentioned  in
subsection (7).

A statement may not be used by virtue of subsection (8)(d) against a person

(9)
unless

(a)

(b)

evidence relating to it is adduced; or

a question relating to it is asked,

by or on behalf of the person in the proceedings arising out of the prosecution.

A  disclosure  order  has  effect  notwithstanding  any  obligation  as  to
(10)
confidentiality  or  any  other  restriction  upon  the  disclosure  of  information
imposed by any enactment, rule of law or otherwise.

For the purposes of subsection (1), “relevant information” is information,
(11)
whether or not contained in a document, which the investigative officer considers
to be relevant to the investigation.

42

(12)
Sections 145 and 148 of the Proceeds and Instrumentalities of Crime Act,
2019 (Act 2019-17) apply in respect of a disclosure order made under this section
as those sections apply to a disclosure order made under that Act and for the
purpose of this Act any reference in section 145 of that Act to a police officer
shall be construed to include an investigative officer.

Search and seizure warrants

43.(1)
Where on an application made by an investigative officer, a Judge in
Chambers is satisfied of the circumstances set out in subsection (3), the judge
may issue a warrant authorizing the officer to

(a)

(b)

enter  and  search  the  premises  specified  in  the  application  for  the
warrant; and

seize and retain any material found on the premises which is likely to
be of substantial value, whether or not by itself, to the investigation for
the purposes of which the application is made.

(2)

An application for a search and seizure warrant shall

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

specify the person subject to investigation;

state that the warrant is sought for the purposes of the investigation;

specify the premises in respect of which the warrant is sought; and

specify the material in respect of which the warrant is sought or, where
the material cannot be identified at the time of the application, state

the premises that

(i)

relates to the person specified in the application or the question
whether that person has committed an offence under this Act or
any  other  enactment
the
investigation of offences to the Commission; and

that  assigns  responsibility  for

(ii)

investigation for the purposes of which the warrant is sought.

(3)

The circumstances referred to in subsection (1) are that

43

(a)

(b)

a disclosure order in relation to material has not been complied with
and there are reasonable grounds for believing that the material is on
the premises specified in the application for the warrant; or

there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the person specified
in the application for the warrant has committed an offence under this
Act or any other enactment that assigns responsibility for investigations
to the Commission and

(i)

the conditions specified in subsection (4) are fulfilled; or

(ii)

the conditions specified in subsection (5) are fulfilled.

(4)

The conditions referred to in subsection (3)(b)(i) are that

(a)

there are reasonable grounds for believing that

(i)

any material on the premises specified in the application for the
warrant is likely to be of substantial value, whether or not by itself,
to the investigation for the purposes of which the warrant is sought;
and

(ii)

it is in the public interest for the material to be obtained, having
regard  to  the  benefit  likely  to  accrue  to  the  investigation  if  the
material is obtained; and

(b)

it would not be appropriate to make a disclosure order because

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

it  is  not  practicable  to  communicate  with  any  person  against
whom the disclosure order could be made;

it is not practicable to communicate with any person who would
be required to comply with an order to grant entry to the premises;
or

the  investigation  might  be  seriously  prejudiced  unless  an
investigative  officer  is  able  to  secure  immediate  access  to  the
material.

44

(5)

The conditions referred to in subsection (3)(b)(ii) are that

(a)

there are reasonable grounds for believing where the material cannot
be identified at the time of the application, that there is material on the
premises specified in the application for the warrant that

(i)

relates to the person specified in the application or the question
whether he has committed an offence under this Act or any other
enactment  that  assigns  responsibility  for  investigations  to  the
Commission; and

(ii)

is likely to be of substantial value, whether or not by itself, to the
investigation for the purposes of which the warrant is sought; and

(b)

there are reasonable grounds for believing that it is in the public interest
for the material to be obtained, having regard to the benefit likely to
accrue to the investigation if the material is obtained; and

one of the following applies:

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

it  is  not  practicable  to  communicate  with  any  person  against
whom a disclosure order could be made;

entry  to  the  premises  will  not  be  granted  unless  a  warrant  is
produced; or

the  investigation  might  be  seriously  prejudiced  unless  an
investigative  officer  arriving  at  the  premises  is  able  to  secure
immediate entry to them.

A search and seizure warrant does not confer the right to seize privileged

(6)
material.

Obstruction of investigative officer

A  person  who  resists  or  obstructs  an  investigative  officer  in  the
44.
execution of his duty is guilty of an offence and is liable, on summary conviction,
to a fine of $10 000 or to imprisonment for 6 months or to both.
