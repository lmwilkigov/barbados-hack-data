In determining whether to enter into a remediation agreement, a prosecutor

that the alleged offender has failed to comply with the terms of the agreement,

15

the prosecutor may make an application to the High Court for it to determine the
matter.

The  court  shall,  on  an  application  referred  to  in  subsection  (1),  decide

the  belief  of  the  prosecutor  that  the  alleged  offender  has  failed  to

(a)

(b)

the  High  Court  has  invited  the  parties  to  vary  the  agreement  under

(4)
declaration under subsection (2).

(8)
agreement, the prosecutor shall publish the declaration of the court under this
section  and  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  make  the  declaration,  unless  the

Proceedings not to be instituted on expiry of remediation agreement

14.(1)
Where a remediation agreement remains in force until its expiry date,
after the expiry of the agreement, subject to subsection (2), no proceedings shall
be instituted against the alleged offender for the alleged offence.

Subsection (1) does not prevent proceedings from being instituted against
(2)
an  alleged  offender  where,  after  a  remediation  agreement  has  expired,  the
prosecutor finds that, during the course of the negotiations for the agreement

(a)

the  alleged  offender  provided  inaccurate,  misleading  or  incomplete
information to the prosecutor; and

18

(b)

the alleged offender knew or ought to have known that the information
was inaccurate, misleading or incomplete.

(3)
A  remediation  agreement  shall  not  be  treated  as  having  expired  for  the
purposes of subsection (1) where, on the expiry date specified in the agreement

(a)

(b)

(c)

an application made by the prosecutor under section 12 has not yet been
decided by the court;

following  an  application  under  section  12  the  court  has  invited  the
parties to agree proposals to remedy the failure of the alleged offender
to comply with the remediation agreement, but the parties have not yet
reached an agreement; or

the parties have agreed proposals to remedy the failure of the alleged
offender to comply with the agreement following an invitation of the
court  under  section  12(3)(a)  but  the  alleged  offender  has  not  yet
complied.

(4)

In the case referred to in

(a)

subsection (3)(a), where the court

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

decides that the alleged offender has not failed to comply with
the  terms  of  the  remediation  agreement  or  that  the  alleged
offender  has  failed  to  comply,  but  does  not  take  action  under
section 12(3), the agreement shall be treated as expiring when the
application is decided;

terminates  the  remediation  agreement,  the  agreement  shall  be
treated as not having remained in force until its expiry date, and
subsection (1) therefore does not apply;

invites the parties to agree proposals to remedy the failure of the
alleged  offender  to  comply  the  remediation  agreement,  the
remediation  agreement  shall  be  treated  as  expiring  when  the
parties have reached such an agreement and the alleged offender
has complied with it;

19

(b)

subsection  (3)(b),  the  remediation  agreement  shall  be  treated  as
expiring when the parties have reached an agreement and the alleged
offender has complied with it; and

(c)

subsection  (3)(c),  the  remediation  agreement  shall  be  treated  as
expiring when the alleged offender complies with the agreement.

Where, by virtue of subsection (1), no proceedings can be instituted against

(5)
the alleged offender for the alleged offence, the prosecutor shall publish

(a)

(b)

the fact that the remediation agreement has expired; and

details of the compliance of the alleged offender with the agreement,

unless the prosecutor is prevented from doing so by any other enactment or by
an order of the court under section 15.

Postponement of publication of information by prosecutor

The High Court may order that the publication of information by the
15.
prosecutor  under  section  11(7),12(5),  (6),  (7)  or  (8),  13(7)  or  (8)  or  14(5)  be
postponed for such period as the court considers necessary if it appears to the
court that postponement is necessary for avoiding a substantial risk of prejudice
to the administration of justice in any legal proceedings.

Use of material in criminal proceedings

16.(1)
Where a remediation agreement between a prosecutor and an alleged
offender has been approved by the High Court under section 11, the statement of
facts  contained  in  the  agreement  shall,  in  any  criminal  proceedings  brought
against the alleged offender for the alleged offence, be treated as an admission
by the alleged offender.

Where  the  prosecutor  and  an  alleged  offender  have  entered  into
(2)
negotiations  for  a  remediation  agreement  but  the  agreement  has  not  been

20

approved by the court under section 11, material described in subsection (4) shall
only be used in evidence against the alleged offender on a prosecution for

(a)

(b)

an  offence  consisting  of  the  provision  of  inaccurate,  misleading  or
incomplete information; or

some  other  offence  where  in  giving  evidence  the  alleged  offender
makes a statement inconsistent with the material.

Notwithstanding subsection (2)(b), material shall not be used against an
(3)
alleged offender by virtue of subsection (2)(b) unless evidence relating to it is
adduced,  or  a  question  relating  to  it  is  asked,  by  or  on  behalf  of  the  alleged
offender in the proceedings arising out of the prosecution.

(4)

The material referred to in subsection (2) is

(a)

material that shows that the alleged offender entered into negotiations
for a remediation agreement, including in particular

(i)

any draft of a statement of facts intended to be included in the
agreement; and

such negotiations; and
