## ON

PLANNING LAW

REFORM

GREEN PAPER ON PLANNING LAW REFORM

Executive Summary

BACKGROUND

The current Town and Country Planning Act was enacted in 1965 and largely based on

earlier UK legislation.  The system was devised for a different era and has its roots in a

different place.  Nearly 52 years after Independence, it is right that we revisit this issue

and  come  up  with  legislation  that  is  relevant  to  a  21st  Century  Barbados.  Our  current

system is neither efficient in its approach nor transparent in its application.  It is seen as

a  barrier  to  investment  and  at  the  same  time  lacks  the  teeth  to  protect  our  fragile

environment and cultural heritage.

In  its  2018  Manifesto,  “Building  The  Best  Barbados  Together”,  the  Government

committed itself to  improving  the quality and speed of delivery of services,  including

Town  and  Country  Planning  permissions,  to  promote  doing  business  with  ease.    The

reform of this outdated legislation was, therefore, identified as “mission critical”.

In order to engage the people of Barbados in the development of new legislation, two

stakeholder consultations on the reform of the planning system were held on 16th and 25th

July  2018  and  social  media  has  also  been  used  to  encourage  participation.  Comments

made by the public have been taken into account in the formulation of this policy paper.

This  paper  examines  the  issues,  considers  options  and  makes  recommendations  for

fundamental reform of the town planning legislation in Barbados.  This reform is essential

to provide a fit for purpose planning system which regains the trust and confidence of

the Barbadian people.  However, it is recognised at the outset that legislative reform on

its  own  is  not  enough.    It  must  be  accompanied  by  fundamental  reform  of  our

management processes and practices if it is to be fully successful.

To guide the review process, the following policy goals and principles were established:

1.  Goal 1 - Transparency and accountability
2.  Goal 2 - Openness and inclusiveness
3.  Goal 3 - Efficiency and effectiveness
4.  Goal 4 - Sustainable Development
5.  Goal 5 - Fit for purpose

1

In delivering these goals the principles of good governance, e-government, consultation

and  participation  and  pro-active  management  should  also  be  applied.    The  report

considers  governance  issues,  a  range  of  strategic  policy  considerations,  together  with

cross cutting and implementation issues. This executive summary highlights the higher

order issues and main changes proposed which will require decision.

GOVERNANCE

There  are  three  basic  models  of  governance  found  in  planning  legislation  in  the

Commonwealth Caribbean.

a)

The Ministerial Model

This  is  the  model  currently  in  operation  in  Barbados.    Under  this  arrangement,  the

responsibility  for  administering  the  legislation  is  vested  in  the  Minister,  but  there  is

considerable  delegation  to  the  Chief  Town  Planner.    The  Minister  has  the  power  to

determine  certain  classes  of  application  and  to  decide  appeals.    The  way  the  system

operates is very opaque, it is susceptible to politicization, and there is scope for personal

corruption.  It is also  narrowly technically  based with limited coordination with other

regulatory  agencies.  There  is,  however,  political  accountability  and  the  costs  of

administration are relatively low.

b)  The Statutory Corporation Model

In  this  arrangement,  the  powers  are  vested  in  a  statutory  corporation  with  a  Board

appointed by the Minister.  This model has limited direct accountability and costs are

high as Statutory Corporations are responsible for their own finances, fixed assets and

personnel.    Although  theoretically  more  independent,  they  are  often  liable  to  political

interference.

c)

The Hybrid Model

This  model  vests  a  statutory  Board  with  the  responsibility  for  decision-making.    The

Board is multi-disciplinary and includes representatives from regulatory authorities and

the private sector and is serviced by the TCPDO.  Collective decision-making increases

transparency, providing conflicts of interest are clarified. As part of this model, a Tribunal

would hear Appeals. The Minister would retain the power to determine certain classes

of development. The costs associated with this option are modest.

2

Proposed Changes

The Hybrid model is recommended but will require clear regulations to govern its

operation.

STRATEGIC POLICY INTERVENTIONS

Physical Development Planning

The Physical Development Plan provides the policy framework to guide development.

The  current  Physical  Development  Plan  amended  (2003)  is  in  the  process  of  being

reviewed with the revised plan awaiting formal consultation and approval.

The PDPs have served Barbados well but there are issues around the legal status of the

plan itself, its content, any lower tier local plans, the provision for public participation

and the frequency of its review.

Proposed changes

It is recommended that:

  The status of the development plan be made more explicit with a presumption
in favour of the development plan that decisions must be made in accordance
with the plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise.

  The second schedule be amended to clarify the status of different types of
plans and make provision for national park planning, conservation area
planning and other types of plans including non- spatial plans and
supplementary planning documents.

  Guidelines for public participation are put in place for the plan preparation

and adoption process

  Consideration be given to appointing a Development Plan Tribunal to

consider representations

  The period for the review of the plan be increased from 5 years to 10 years
  Greater emphasis is placed on aspects of implementation other than just

development control

3

Regulation of Land Development

The  purpose  of  planning  legislation  is  to  provide  for  the  orderly  and  progressive

“development of land”.  Development is defined as -

  The carrying out of building, engineering, mining or other operations in, on or

under any land

  The making of any material changes in the use of any buildings or land
  The subdivision of land

The definition of land includes the seabed underlying the Territorial Waters of Barbados.

The definition of development is broadly satisfactory although there is a need to consider

the inclusion of demolition (particularly in relation to listed buildings) and to ensure that

sand  mining  is  also  covered.    The  subdivision  provisions  have  also  created  some

problems in relation to servicing and maintenance of vacant lots.  Consideration could be

given to creating a new class of subdivision or severance for small scale division of lots

in already serviced areas

 There are two classes of application – outline and full. Some suggestions have been made

that  it might  be possible to also distinguish between simple and  complex  applications

and this could also be reflected in the time limits for processing applications.

Some types of development are deemed to be permitted and are set out in the Town and

Country Planning Development Order. This order is in need of revision and updating.

There  are  certain  categories  of  application  that  are  determined  by  the  Minister  and

provisions exist for having a hearing.  This element of the system is prone to long delays

and the existing arrangements have been discredited because of lack of transparency and

the capabilities of the persons conducting hearings.

Barbados  has  entered  into  international  commitments  to  undertake  Environmental

Impact Assessments (EIAs) on proposed activities which are likely to have an adverse

effect  on  the  environment  but  to  date  there  is  no  comprehensive  legal  framework

covering this.  An EIA Regulation should be prepared as a matter of urgency to clarify

when an EIA is required, how it should be conducted and how the mitigation measures

proposed will be monitored.

4

There is similarly a need to clarify the ways in which the Coastal Zone Management Act

and the Town and Country Planning Act interact and the role of the CZMU in decision-

making on planning applications

There is also a need to strengthen the provisions relating to the conservation of the built

heritage (buildings and areas) and the protection of trees.

Proposed changes

  To consider changes to the definition of development to include the
demolition or the making of material alterations to a listed building.

  To consider if it is appropriate to introduce a definition of simple and complex

applications

  To consider introducing a new category of certified development
  To impose requirements on subdivisions for maintenance of the infrastructure

and open spaces

  To create a new category of severance for small subdivisions in areas already

serviced

  To review the schedule of Permitted Development (and associated conditions)

and the Use Classes Order to reflect changing circumstances

  Decisions on applications should be made by a new Sustainable Development
Board.  This Board should comprise ex-officio public officials and private
sector representatives and the CTP should serve as the CEO/Secretary of the
Board

  Applications referred to the Minister for decision should be significant

departures from the PDP and/or matters of strategic economic or
environmental importance. A qualified inspector should hold a hearing and
report to the Minister on these applications.  Rules for the conduct of hearings
and site visits should be clarified and any report or decision should be made
publicly available. Strict timetables should be adhered to

  Published statements of planning policy related to site development standards



should be formally adopted by the Minister
 EIA Regulations should be prepared to clarify the process and put it on a legal
footing

  The role of the CZMU in planning applications in the coastal zone and in

future on the seabed outside the coastal zone should be clarified

  Provision for making and updating the register of listed buildings should be
strengthened and made more transparent and the declaration of conservation
areas put on a legal footing and the use of Heritage Impact Assessments
clarified

5

  Consideration should be given to having a sub-committee to advise the Board

on design and conservation matters

  Consideration be given to developing and implementing an Empty Property

Strategy

  Provisions are made for the use of compulsory powers to support this strategy
  The Tree (Preservation) Act should be repealed and its provisions incorporated
into the new Town and Country Planning Act including a new definition of
“tree”.  The powers currently assigned to the Minister under these provisions
should be transferred to the Sustainable Development Board

Planning Obligations

The concept of planning obligations was first introduced to Barbados by the Town and

Country Planning (Amendment) Act 2007.  In that amendment it was limited to provision

of  affordable  housing.    However,  in  other  jurisdictions  it  is  used  to  fund  a  range  of

physical, social and environmental requirements.

Proposed changes

  To introduce new broader provisions for planning obligations

Limitation Periods

It is important to set strict timetables for processing applications with some form of

recourse if they are not met

Proposed Changes

  A tiered system of timescales should be introduced with 8 weeks for simple
applications,13 weeks for complex application and 16 weeks for applications
requiring an EIA

  Strict time lines should be adhered from the date of receipt of required

information from the applicant

  Consultations with referral agencies should be in accordance with existing
strict time lines and consultations should be carried out electronically
  There should be recourse to appeal to the Board if timelines are not met.

6

Enforcement

The CTP has a great deal of discretion to take action against anyone who is in breach of

the planning legislation.  The process lacks transparency and the penalties available do

not act as a deterrent.

Proposed changes

  The relevant authority should have to succeed in a prosecution based on an

Enforcement Notice before exercising the power of demolition

  The grounds on which an Enforcement Notice can be appealed to a Judge in

Chambers should not be limited

  Provision should be made for appeal against Stop Notices, to avoid the
necessity, costs and delays associated with Judicial Review proceedings

  Enforcement and Stop Notices should be prepared and served by persons with

adequate training in legal requirements and procedures

  The CTP should keep a publicly accessible register of Enforcement Action

which should be available on-line

  The CTP should report to the Sustainable Development Board on complaints

of breaches and enforcement action taken

Administrative Fees and Penalties

The fees charged for planning applications were first introduced in 1970 and have only

been reviewed once, in 2009.  Similarly, penalties for breaches in planning regulations

have never been increased and are now so low that they fail to act as a deterrent.

Proposed changes

  A new schedule of fees should be prepared and reviewed annually
  Penalties and fines should be reviewed to bring them in line with similar

offences

  Fines should be reviewed regularly by the Sustainable Development Board to

take into account inflation and changing attitudes to the offence

Appeals

S19 of the current legislation provides for an applicant, who is aggrieved by a decision to

refuse  planning  permission  or  conditions  applied  to  a  permission,  to  appeal  to  the

Minister  to  have  the  decision  reviewed.    It  is  recommended  that  the  duties  currently
7

undertaken by the Minister on recommendation from a person appointed by the Minister

be  transferred  to  a  Planning  Appeals  Tribunal.    The  Tribunal  should  be  comprised  of

qualified people with relevant planning experience.

Proposed changes

  To transfer the responsibility for hearing and deciding on appeals to a

Planning Appeals Tribunal

  Rules for the conduct of hearings and site visits should be clarified and any

report or decision should be made publicly available. Strict timetables should
be adhered to

CROSS CUTTING ISSUES

Public Participation and Access to Information

The principles of public participation in decision-making were enshrined in Principle 10

of  the  1992  Rio  Declaration.    Involvement  of  the  public  is  important  in  the  decision-

making  process,  but  many  existing  planning  processes  are  opaque  and  allow  for  no

public engagement.  This lack of openness leads to a mistrust of the system.  Opening the

system up to public scrutiny and involvement is critical to restore confidence.  While the

recent review of the PDP has illustrated a progressive approach to public engagement,

the rest of the system has limited participation.

 A common complaint of the existing system is the difficulty of accessing  information.

Information is important to inform effective public participation and to allow individuals

to  track  the  progress  of  planning  applications.    Even  the  current  statutory  register  is

inadequate, providing very little useful information.

Proposed changes

  The publication of a meaningful weekly list of applications received and
decisions made. This list to be sent to the press and published on-line
  Explore the possibility of a comprehensive planning portal that can be

accessed by the public to find information on applications, decisions and
appeals

  Applicants to be required to post a notice on site before the submission of a

planning application

8

  Third party objections should be taken into account when determining an

application

  The applicant and third parties should be able to submit evidence and speak

briefly at the Sustainable Development Board

Inter-Agency Consultation

The  performance  of  statutory  consultees  is  one  of  the  main  reasons  for  delays  and

inefficiency in the current system and needs to be addressed.

Proposed changes

  Electronic means of communication should be the norm for these

consultations

  Consideration be given to arranging meetings of all consultees to advise

applicants for large development of what is required and plan a coordinated
response

IMPLEMENTATION

Once the legislation is in place there will be a need to prepare the more detailed orders

and regulations and to establish the new governance arrangements.  What is proposed is

a significant change from existing practices.  For the changes to be successful, there will

be a need for strong leadership to deliver a change in culture.  Managing this change will

be critical.  New processes will need to be put in place and training provided to develop

new skills.

Proposed changes

  Introduce change management and training programmes for staff and Board

members

  Put in place new procedures and processes
  Manage pro-actively with performance targets
  Deliver quick wins (changes that can be introduced easily without legislation

or major funding implications) which will increase transparency and
efficiency and reinforce the new ways that the service is to be delivered in
future

CONCLUSION

This  Green  Paper  highlights  a  number  of  possible  improvements  to  the  existing  town

planning  system  which  are  aimed  at  delivering  the  broad  goals  of  transparency  and

accountability, openness and inclusiveness, efficiency and effectiveness, and achieving

sustainable development and a system which is tailored to Barbadian society and fit for

purpose.

INTRODUCTION

Regulatory  controls  governing  the  development  of  land  –  inclusive  of  its  land  use,

building  design  and  waste disposal aspects  - have been  in force  in Barbados for more

than  half  a  century.  The  existing  law  regarding  land  use  planning  and  development

control, the Town and Country Planning Act, CAP.240 (the Act), was enacted in 1965 and

came into force on July 8th, 1968, fifty years ago. This legislation was based largely on the

eponymous  British  legislation  of  1947;  however,  in  the  absence  of  a  system  of  local

government  in  Barbados,  the  powers  vested  in  the  Local  Authorities  in  Britain  were

conferred on a government official, the Chief Town Planner (CTP), in Barbados. Hence,

from  the  inception,  the  regulatory  system  in  Barbados  has  lacked  key  elements  of

transparency and accountability that are inherent in the British system.

Substantial amendments have been made to the Act over the years, namely in 1968, 1981,

1983, 1998 and 2007. For the most part, these amendments were designed to import into

the Act changes in planning law in Britain, with the exception of the amendments made

in 1998  which were  consequential on the enactment of the  Coastal Zone Management

Act, CAP.394. The original legislation envisaged an efficient regulatory process, with a

limitation  period  of  2  months  for  determining  applications  for  planning  permission,

inclusive of 14 to 21 days for interdepartmental consultations. Embedded amongst the

1981 amendments was a provision which removed the obligation of the CTP to seek the

applicant’s agreement for extensions of the 2-month statutory deadline. It is arguable that

-  in  addition  to  the  growing  complexity  of  information  requirements  in  support  of

applications  -  this  amendment  has  been  the  major  cause  of  the  inordinate  delays  in

decision-making which now characterize the system.

In its 2018 report, “Doing Business”, the World Bank ranked Barbados 132nd out of the

190 countries studied with respect to the overall ease of doing business. This represents

a slippage of 15 places below its previous position.  A major factor explaining this  low

ranking is the fact that Barbados is 155th with respect to dealing with construction permits,

which take an average of 442 days (14.5 months) to be approved, in comparison with the

average  time  of  192  days  (6.3  months)  for  all  countries  in  the  Latin  America  and

Caribbean  region.  Notably,  this  average  delay  in  permitting  exceeds  the  2-month

limitation period for the determination of applications for planning permission set by the

Act by more than a year.

13

In  its  2018  Manifesto,  “Building  The  Best  Barbados  Together”,  the  Government

committed itself to  improving  the quality and speed of delivery of services,  including

Town  and  Country  Planning  permissions,  to  promote  doing  business  with  ease  in

Barbados.  Further,  it  undertook  to  modernize  our  approach  to  Physical  Development

Planning  by  making  the  development  control  process  transparent  and  accountable  by

providing, amongst other things, for public comment on development proposals, public

participation  in  decision  making,  and  the  publication  of  decisions  and  the  reasons  for

approval or refusal of applications.

The existing Act and the subsidiary legislation made under it – the Town and Country

Planning  (Fees)  Regulations,  1970,  S.I.  1970  No.181;  the  Town  and  Country  Planning

Development  Order,  1972,  S.I.  1972  No.75,  and  the  Town  and  Country  Planning

Regulations,  1972,  S.I.  1972  No.76  -  are  all  obsolete  and  not  consistent  with  these

principles.  The  review,  repeal  and  replacement  of  the  existing  legislation  are  urgently

needed as the introduction of transparent and efficient development control processes

was designated in the Manifesto as “Mission Critical”.

In  order  to  engage  the  people  of  Barbados  in  the  development  of  new  legislation,  the

Prime  Minister’s  Office  in  partnership  with  the  Barbados  Town  Planning  Society

organised  two  stakeholder  consultations  on  the  reform  of  the  planning  system.  These

were held on 16th and 25th July 2018 and live-streamed for interactive public participation

on

the  GIS  website.  A  separate  e-mail  address

for  submitting  comments

townplanningreform@barbados.gov.bb was also established to allow wider engagement

by the public in suggesting changes.  The issues raised and recommendations made by

participants  in  these  stakeholder  events  and  comments  made  by  the  public  have  been

taken into account in the formulation of this policy paper.

POLICY GOALS AND PRINCIPLES

As  mentioned  previously  the  Town  and  Country  Planning  Act,  enacted  in  1965,  was

largely based on earlier UK legislation.  The system was devised for a different era and

has its roots in a different place.  Nearly 52 years after Independence, it is right that we

revisit this issue and come up with legislation that is relevant to a 21st Century Barbados.

Our current system is neither efficient in its approach nor transparent in its application.

14

It is seen as a barrier to investment and at the same time lacks the teeth to protect our

fragile environment and cultural heritage.

The Government has established a governance model for approaching reform which has

been used as a starting point for identifying the policy goals and principles that should

guide this reform.  The questions posed are as follows:

1.  What is the public interest that the Government must seek to protect?
2.  What is the public mischief against which the government must guard?
3.  How might the use of technology help the government achieve national goals?
4.  What  are  the  social  justice  issues  which  the  government  needs  to  take  into

account?

5.  What structures and processes can government put in place to obtain the views of

Barbadians and include them in decision making?

Goals

The  following  goals  will  guide  the  review  process  and  proposed  changes  should  be

measured against them.

1.  GOAL 1: Transparency and accountability

All decisions in the town planning system should be made in a way that it is clear

about who or what body has made the decision and why the decision has been

made.

2.  GOAL 2: Openness and inclusiveness

Members of the public should be able to input into the decision making process.

Where possible decisions should be made in public and individuals should have

a right  to have their views heard.   Public registers should be accessible  in hard

copy and on line.

3.  GOAL 3:  Efficiency and effectiveness

Decisions should be made in a timely manner, and prescribed timescales should

be adhered to by all parties.

4.  GOAL 4: Sustainable development

Decisions should be guided by the principles of sustainable development ensuring

long term environmental, economic and community health and wellbeing.

15

5.  GOAL5: Fit for purpose

All  legislation,  regulations,  policies  and  procedures  should  be  fit  for  purpose.

They should reflect the specific needs of Barbados as a small island state in the 21st

century.

Principles

1.  PRINCIPLE 1: Good Governance

Good governance is critical to ensure trust and confidence in the system.  In a small

and  interconnected  society  like  Barbados  it  is  important  to  guard  against  the

influence  exercised  by  proximity  and  the  potential  for  corruption.    Governance

arrangements should be put in place that reduce the potential for undue influence

or  corruption  and  require  high  standards  of  integrity  including  declarations  of

interest.

2.  PRINCIPLE 2: E-Government (digital by default)

In the 21st Century the maximum use should be made of e-government.  The Town

Planning system should be computerised in a way that allows easy access by the

public  to  information,  more  efficient  consultations  and  reduces  bureaucratic

delays.    Improved  platforms  for  data  sharing  and  providing  management

information  should  be  used  to  improve  plan  making,  provide  evidence  based

policy decisions, improved management information, as well as improvements to

the user experience.

3.  PRINCIPLE 3: Consultation and participation.

Both  the  plan  making  process  and  the  regulation  of  development  should

encourage  public  participation.    An  ability  to  influence  decisions  will  help

improve  the  public  understanding  of  the  planning  system  and  make  it  a  more

valued and trusted part of government activity.

4.  PRINCIPLE 4: Proactive Management

A  new culture of proactive management  which encourages interaction with the

public  and  is  focused  on  enabling  and  facilitating  high  quality  sustainable

development  not  just  controlling  and  regulating  development,  will  require  a

culture change.  It will also need to proactively monitor and manage performance

to achieve the necessary improvements.

3.

GOVERNANCE

Major changes to the existing administrative provisions for governance of  the physical

development planning and development control processes that are provided for by the

existing planning legislation are necessary in order to conform to the policy goals and

principles enunciated above.

There  are  three  basic  types  of  administrative  arrangements  to  be  found  in  planning

legislation  in the Commonwealth Caribbean. Each has advantages  and disadvantages.

These can be summarized as follows.

a)

The Ministerial Model

In countries where this structure is in place, including Barbados, responsibility for the

administration of the legislation is vested in a Minister and it is administered in practice

by a department within the Ministry. In some countries where this structure is in place,

the legislation does not even mention the relevant department. Barbados is the exception

in  that  the  existing  legislation  expressly  states  that  the  CTP  is  responsible  for  the

preparation  of  development  plans  and,  except  in  specified  cases,  for  determining

applications for planning permission. The Minister has the power to determine specific

types  of  applications  and  to  decide  appeals  against  decisions  of  the  CTP.    There  is

provision for the appointment by the Minister of a Town and Country Planning Advisory

Committee, but the role of this body is purely advisory and limited in remit to matters

on which the Minister seeks its advice.

The advantages of this arrangement are that the Minister has ultimate authority over the

processes  of  development  planning  and  development  control  for  which  he/she  is

responsible  to  Parliament.  Additionally,  the  overhead  costs  of  administration  are

relatively low because there are shared with the Ministry and, to some extent, the public

service as a whole. The disadvantages of this arrangement  are that decision-making  is

susceptible to politicization; inputs from other regulatory agencies are not a priority for

those  bodies;  and  decisions  tend  to  be  made  on  a  narrow  technical  basis.  The

organizational  culture  tends  to  be  bureaucratic  and  decision-making  opaque.  Hence,

there is scope for influence peddling and personal corruption and a pervading suspicion

that corruption exists. This undermines the credibility of the system.

17

b)  The Statutory Corporation Model

In countries where this structure is in place, responsibility for the administration of the

legislation is vested in a statutory corporation with a Board of Directors appointed by the

Minister,  which  includes  members  of  civil  society.  The  Board  is  responsible  for

administering the law in accordance with policy directions received from the Minister,

but the law is administered in practice by the staff of the statutory corporation under the

general  supervision  of  the  Board.  Appeals  from  decisions  of  the  staff  of  the  statutory

corporation are usually to a court of law.

The theoretical advantages of this arrangement are that the body corporate enjoys greater

autonomy than a department of government; the oversight of technical decision-makers

by a Board inclusive of members of civil society broadens the perspectives of the agency;

the ability of the corporation to hire staff on better terms than are available in the public

service permits it to compete with the private sector for human resources; and it should

have  a  business-like  corporate  rather  than  bureaucratic  organizational  culture.  The

disadvantages of this  arrangement  are that the Minister has only indirect control over

matters  for  which  he/she  is  responsible  to  Parliament;  and  the  overhead  costs  of  the

institution  are  relatively  high,  as  a  statutory  corporation  is  responsible  for  the

management of its own finances, fixed assets, and personnel.

Experience  in  the  Commonwealth  Caribbean  has  shown  that  most  of  the  theoretical

advantages of statutory corporations are illusory. Appointments to the Boards are often

made on the basis of political allegiance, rather than professional competence, and the

powers  of  the  Minister  to  give  directions  to  the  Board  are  used  to  micro-manage  the

supposedly  semi-autonomous  agencies.  Further,  most  of  these  agencies  are  staffed  by

former public servants or public servants seconded from various departments; hence, the

culture remains bureaucratic.

c)

The Hybrid Model

In  the  countries  where  this  structure  is  in  place,  namely  all  the  OECS  countries,

responsibility for the administration of the legislation is vested in a statutory Board with

executive  powers  that  is  comprised  of  ex  officio  members  from  relevant  government

departments and persons from the private sector appointed by the Minister. The day to

day  discharge  of  the  development  control  functions  provided  for  by  the  legislation,

including the receipt and processing of applications for planning permission, is carried

18

out by a department of the Ministry and the head of that department is designated as the

Executive  Secretary  of  the  Board  and/or  its  Chief  Executive  Officer.  Appeals  against

decisions of the Board are heard by an Appeals Tribunal appointed under the Act. The

Minister/Cabinet  retains  the  power  to  determine  specific  applications  or  classes  of

applications.

The principal advantage of this hybrid arrangement is that most decisions are made by a

multi-disciplinary body which includes representatives of other regulatory agencies and

of civil society. This improves inter-agency coordination, allows for a sharing of expertise

that  reduces  the  duplication  of  functions  within  the  public  service  and  promotes

pragmatism  in  decision-making.  Moreover,  the  collective  decision-making  process

promotes transparency and discourages personal corruption. Additionally, the overhead

costs are low because the statutory Board does not have staff of its own but is supported

by the Ministry. The principal disadvantage of this arrangement is that in small societies

Board members are susceptible to conflicts of  interests; so this needs to be  adequately

guarded against in the legislation. A particular weakness of this model as it operates in

the OCES countries is that development control is divorced from development planning

and is undertaken in  the absence of a land use plan and/or published policy documents.

Hence,  decision-making  is  necessarily  ad  hoc;  however,  this  will  not  be  the  case  in

Barbados where both a statutory plan and published policy documents exist.

Recommendations -

On the basis of decades of experience with the operation of these three types of systems

in  SIDS  in  the  Commonwealth  Caribbean,  it  is  strongly  recommended  that  the

governance structure for the new planning legislation in Barbados should be based on

the  hybrid  model.  Further  details  of  the  proposed  governance  arrangements  will  be

discussed  in  the  following  sections  of  this  paper;  however,  the  main  features  of  the

proposed arrangements are that -

  The Minister will retain the power to determine specific classes of applications and

have  the  power  to  appoint  the  private  sector  members  of  the  Sustainable

Development Board and the Appeals Tribunal.

  Additionally,  the  Minister  will  have  oversight  of  the  department  of  his/her

Ministry (the TCPDO) responsible for carrying out the day to day work of physical

development planning and development control;

19

  Decisions on routine applications for planning permission will be made by a multi-

disciplinary statutory Board (the Sustainable Development Board), inclusive of the

representatives of the agencies which are routinely consulted about applications

and stakeholders from the private sector. This will introduce transparency into the

decision-making process and eliminate opportunities for personal corruption;
  Delays  caused  by  the  referral  of  applications  to  other  regulatory  agencies  for

statutory consultations  will  be minimized  by the inclusion of representatives of

the key agencies on the Board as ex officio members;

  The  appointment  of  private  sector  members  to  the  Board,  nominated  by

professional  bodies  and  organizations  representing  business  interests,  will

provide  for  stakeholder  involvement  in  decision-making  and  for  pragmatic

considerations to be taken into account in regulatory decision-making;



It  is  recommended  that  the  formal  title  of  the  Board  should  be  the  Sustainable

Development  Board  to  reflect  a  positive  approach  to  high  quality  development

and commitment to achieving environmental standards;

  Appeals  against  decisions  of  the  Board  will  be  heard  and  decided  by  a  capable

Appeals Tribunal with due process guarantees;

  The  jurisdiction  of  this  Tribunal  could  extend  to  the  hearing  of  appeals  against

administrative decisions made under other regulatory laws governing land use,

development and the environment;

  Meetings of the Board and the Tribunal should be conducted in public;
  Administrative  costs  will  be  minimized  and  adequate  provision  made  for  cost

recovery.

### 4.  STRATEGIES

#### A.  Physical Development Planning

A  development  plan  is  commonly  recognized  as  a  policy  framework  representing  a

Government’s  vision  for  land  use  and  development.  This  framework  is  then  used  to

guide  and  facilitate  the  development  of  individual  land  parcels  within  a  specific

jurisdiction.

1)

Type/Hierarchy of Plans

Subsections  5(1)  and  (2)  of  the  existing  Act  make  provision  for  the  preparation  of  a

development plan for the whole island. Section 2 refers to a development plan consisting
20

of a report of an island survey together with a plan proposing how land may be used and

the stages for the carrying out of any proposed development.

Section 6(1) indicates that the national development plan may allocate sites and areas of

land for roads, public and other buildings and works, air-fields, parks, pleasure grounds,

nature  reserves,  open  spaces,  agriculture,  residential,  industrial,  commercial  or  other

purposes.  The  national  development  plan  would  also  designate  land  subject  to

compulsory acquisition by the Crown

The Act further makes provision in s.6(2) for the preparation of development plans for

parts  of  the  island  at  a  more  in-depth  level  through  the  defining  of  areas  for  a

comprehensive  development  plan.  This  second  tier  of  development  planning  may  be

defined  by  the  CTP  under  the  current  administrative  arrangements.  A  comprehensive

development plan may be prepared for an area to be developed or redeveloped. The Act

does  not  specify  the  level  or  type  of  development  planning  within  the  notion  of  a

comprehensive development plan leaving this up to the professional judgement of the

CTP.

Under s.6(2) of the Act, a comprehensive development plan for an area that should be

developed  or  redeveloped  may  address:  bad  lay-out  or  obsolete  development;  the

relocation of population or industry or the replacement of open space in the course of the

development or re-development of any other area; or any other purpose specified in the

plan.

The Second Schedule of the Act makes specific provision for those matters that may be

included in a development plan. Part 1- Roads; Part II – Buildings and Other Structures;

Part  III  –  Community  Planning;  Part  IV  –  Amenities  (including  allocation  of  lands  for

burial  grounds  and  crematoria,  communal  parks,  birds  and  sanctuaries,  protection  of

marine  life,  preservation  of  buildings,  caves,  sites  and  objects  of  artistic,  architectural,

archaeological  or  historic  interest,  preservation  or  protection  of  forests,  woods,  trees

shrub,  plants  and  flowers);  Part  V  –  Public  Services,  Part  VI  -  Transport  and

Communication, Part VII – Miscellaneous.

In  the  Barbados  Physical  Development  Plan  1988,  under  the  “Plan  Implementation”

section, there  is mention of the introduction of a three-tier planning system - national,

intermediate  and  local  area  levels.  In  the  Barbados  Physical  Development  Plan  2003,

21

reference is made to the national plan as a framework for detailed “structure plans” and

“local area plans”. Also, in the PDP 2003, there is the inclusion a National Park Plan which

is a subject area plan and five (5) community plans that represent the detailed planning

goals  and  objectives  for  the  specified  communities.    There  was  no  updating  of  any

legislative measures to reflect these changes and none was necessary given the flexibility

that resides in the current Act for a second tier of development planning.  On this basis,

development plans may be prepared for any area of the island as the society experiences

changes in socio-economic conditions and may find itself having to deal with new and

emerging issues over time.

Through  a  review  of  other  Caribbean  jurisdictions  such  as  the  Cayman  Islands  and

Bermuda, the identification of a hierarchy of plans seems often to correspond with the

presence  of  a  decentralised  system  of  governance.  For  example,  in  Bermuda  the

legislation specifically makes provision for the preparation of a development plan for the

City of Hamilton, the capital, and one of two municipal sub-national entities. Similarly,

in the United Kingdom, there is a National Planning Policy Framework and guidance to

which Council’s Local Plans must conform and there is also provision for supplementary

planning documents which when approved form part of the Local Plan.  In addition it is

possible  for  local  communities  to  trigger  neighbourhood  plans  which  can  also  be

approved and become part of the statutory local plan.

It is recommended that consideration be given to the inclusion of a development plan for

the City of Bridgetown and that consideration be given to awarding this capital area the

status of a municipality under the relevant legislation. It is recommended also that the

relationship  between  the  national  plan  and  other  comprehensive  development  plans

(local, community, regional, conservation, heritage, park, and so forth) be clearly stated.

The hierarchical planning system in Southern Australia, for example, explicitly states that

plans  for  the  lower  level  tiers  must  reflect  policies  outlined  in  the  planning  strategies

outlined in the tier above and as such must be reviewed to remain consistent. In this vein,

all  comprehensive  development  plans  must  adhere  to  the  strategies  as  set  out  in  the

national plan.

As  stated  earlier,  the  Second  Schedule  of  the  Act  offers  a  list  of  matters  for  which

provision may be made in the development plans. Specifically, community planning is

mentioned  in  Part  III  but  no  other  type  of  comprehensive  development  plan.  A  wide

range of area plans have been prepared by the Town and Country Development Planning

22

Office (TCPDO) over the years, including the Greater Bridgetown Development Plan of

1988.    It  is  recommended  that  the  Second  Schedule  may  be  amended  to  remove

“Community Planning” and replace this with a list of essential components for all types

of  comprehensive  development  plans.  Alternatively,  a  broader  list  of  possible

comprehensive development plans should be added for the purposes of the second tier

of  development  planning.  Provision  may  be  made  for  national  park  planning,

conservation area planning, heritage area planning, among others.

There are also a number of policy issues which are non-spatial in nature.  Such policies

which are  important to guide development also need to be put on a statutory footing.

Provision  should  be  made  for  preparing  and  adopting  such  supplementary  planning

documents as part of the Physical, Development Plan.  These could include for example

a policy on urban design and a high buildings policy.

2)

Status of Plans

The  current  Act  does  not  speak  specifically  to  the  status  of  a  Development  Plan  as  a

decision making tool.  The Act is approved by Parliament as recorded in s.10(2) and for

the purposes of decision making the Act states in s.16(1) that the development plan could

be one of a number of items considered to be a material  consideration in the decision

making  process  as  follows:  “Subject  to  this  section  and  sections  17  and  18,  where

application is made to the Chief Town Planner for planning permission, that officer, in

dealing  with  the  applications,  shall  have  regard  to  the  provisions  of  the  development

plan, so far as material to the application and to any other material considerations.”

In contrast to the approach taken in CAP 240, there is a presumption in English law in

favour of the Development Plan. This is stated in s.38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory

Purchase Act 2004 as, “If regard is to be had to the development plan for the purpose of

any determination to be made under the planning Acts the determination must be made

in  accordance  with  the  plan  unless  material  considerations  indicate  otherwise”.    The

English case law on this presumption follows the wording of the Act, but leaves it to the

decision maker to determine the weight that should be given to material considerations.

Given the manner in which the status of the PDP is represented in the Barbados Act, there

have been conflicting rulings in the Courts on its role in decision making for development

activity.

23

An early comment on the lack of clarity on the role of the development plan is included

in the 1986 Report of the Commission of Enquiry into the Physical Development Plan

1988 by Justice C. Roachford.  Justice Roachford had to make a ruling on the status of the

development plan prior to assessing public representations of the provisions of the Plan.

He ruled that the Physical Development Plan was a broad policy document intended to

guide settlement and development patterns for a given period. The development plan

was  not  to  be  followed  slavishly  but  was  to  be  considered  along  with  other  material

considerations such as ministerial policies, existing development rights, the availability

of alternative sites, retention of existing use, fear of setting a precedent. This perspective

was shared by Sir D. Williams CJ when he passed a judgement in the Oldbury case, R v.

Minister of Housing & Lands ex p. Knitwear Ltd, HCA No.1555/1989.  In that case, the

former  Chief  Justice  declared  that  the  Physical  Development  Plan  is  a  broad  policy

document which is to be seen as only one of the considerations informing decisions on

applications.  The  view  that  the  plan  was  not  binding  was  also  taken  by  the  Court  of

Appeal in the subsequent case of Scotland District Association Inc. v. Attorney General,

Minister of Town & Country Planning & Minister of Health, CA No.17/1996.

In contrast there is the more recent judgment in the recent case of St. Hill v Chief Town

Planner  and  Attorney  General,  No.1617  of  2011  (the  Six  Men’s  case),  in  which  Justice

Cornelieus opined - regarding the status of the development plan - that it “has the effect

of current law" (p.45). She continues that, "The Act states that the Physical Development

Plan is to be seen as a Development Order as provided for under Part 3 of the Act" (p.45,

paragraph  84).    In  this  same  judgment  she  concluded  that,  "a  declaration  that  the

Development Plan inclusive of amendments under the Town and Country Planning Act

Cap 240 is a statutory instrument is refused".

The foregoing is intended to underscore the need for the status of the development plan

to be made explicit. In those jurisdictions reviewed, Cayman. Bermuda, Singapore, the

national  development  plan  (or  master  plan  in  the  case  of  Singapore)  are  all  statutory

instruments. This approach is recommended along with a presumption in favour of the

development  plan  in  the  new  Act,  together  with  supporting  appropriate  governance

mechanisms as deemed necessary.

24

3)

Plan Preparation Procedure

Section 8 of the Act states that, “the Chief Town Planner may, during the preparation of

a development plan relating to any land or during the preparation of any proposals for

alterations or additions to any such plan, consult such persons or bodies as he thinks fit”.

Hence,  the  methodology  for  the  development  plan  preparation  process  is  left  to  the

discretion of the CTP under current legislation.

The preparation of a development plan is a technical process, starting from the defining

of goals through to implementation and monitoring. The stages and steps followed by a

particular  authority  or  regulatory  body  might  differ.  Also  the  complexity  of  the

jurisdiction  and  the  organisation  itself  has  a  direct  impact  on  the  process  adopted.  In

reviewing the development plan-making process in selected jurisdictions, it was noted

that the importance of having explicit procedures in place for plan-making is a common

practice  for  many  modern  development  planning  systems.  The  Cayman  Islands,

Bermuda and Singapore use schedules or equivalent to elaborate on the plan preparation

process while in England plan making procedures are detailed in the main sections of the

relevant Act.

5.Adoption

Figure 1: Stages of developing a Local Development Plan (adapted from Ministry of Housing Communities &
Local Government 2018)

On the basis of the foregoing it is recommended that plan making procedures be adopted

for  Barbados  as  deemed  appropriate.  These  might  be  elaborated  in  an  appropriate

Schedule to attend the Act.  Alternatively, the publication of detailed  guidance /advice

document may be used to direct the procedures.

25

4)

Public Comment Procedure

Section  9(4)  of  the  current  Act  states  that  before  approving  any  development  plan  or

proposals for the amendment of any such plan, the Minister shall cause to be published

in three issues of the Official Gazette and of at least one newspaper published in the Island

a notice: (a) stating that a development plan, or proposals for the amendment of such a

plan, have been prepared by the CTP; (b) naming the place or places where copies of the

plan or proposals may be inspected and purchased by the public; and (c) stating the time

(being  not  less  than  twenty-eight  days  from  the  last  publication  of  such  notice  in  the

Official Gazette ) within which objections or representations may be made to the Minister

with respect to the plan or proposals.

Currently, procedures for public participation in the development plan process relate to

inspection  of  the  draft  development  plan  before  it  is  adopted  by  the  Government.

However, it is widely acknowledged that involving the community in development plan

preparation is one of the most important components in plan making as the community

members know best their local issues and possible solutions. The whole aim of having a

development plan is to guide and facilitate development  for the residents of the place

and business operators. It therefore becomes essential to take their views, objections and

suggestions into account during the plan preparation process.

Although there are currently no statutory requirements for early consultation, there was

extensive public participation in the preparation of the 2017 draft PDP amendment in line

with good practice.

The  legal  position  is  clearer  elsewhere.    For  example,  in  England,  local  councils  must

facilitate discussions and consultation with local communities and other stakeholders in

the initial stage of preparing a Local Development Plan. This form of consultation may

be done at public events, panel discussions, leaflets, press articles or council magazines.

Provision  might  also  be  made  for  the  use  of  social  media  to  engage  stakeholders.

Following the evidence gathering stage, the local council is required to publish the Local

Plan for consultation, which must take place for a minimum of six weeks.

26

Figure 2: Opportunities for public comment in the preparation of Local Development Plans (sourced from Campaign
to Protect Rural England 2018)

It is recognized that managing numerous stakeholders can be challenging. Therefore it is

recommended, for Barbados, that guidelines for public participation procedures be put

in  place  for  plan  preparation  and  adoption  processes.    The  guidelines  for  public

participation may be included in appropriate schedules to the Act or through the use of

guidance/ advice notes.

5)  Adoption of Plans

A procedure for the adoption of development plans is outlined in Sections 9 and 10 of the

current Act. Before approval of a development plan or proposals for the amendment of

any such plan, the Minister responsible for planning has to place an official notice in the

public domain indicating that the Plan has been prepared, name the place or places where

the Plan may be inspected by the public and state the time period (usually 28 days from

last  public  notice)  within  which  objections  or  representations  may  be  made  to  the

Minister. A Commissioner is appointed to consider objections and representations from

the public using established regulatory proceedings for public enquiry.

27

Section 10 states: (1) Notice shall be published in three issues of the Official Gazette and

of at least one newspaper published in the Island of the approval by the Minister of a

development plan or of proposals for amendment of such a plan, and copies of any such

plan  or  proposals  as  approved  by  the  Minister  shall  be  available  for  inspection  and

purchase  by  the  public.  (2)  Every  development  plan  or  amendment  of  a  development

plan shall, after approval by the Minister, be submitted for the approval of both Houses

and if approved by resolution of both Houses shall come into operation on such date after

its approval by Parliament as the Minister may appoint by notice published in the Official

Gazette.

In  other  jurisdictions  in  the  region,  there  is  a  similar  procedure  for  the  adoption  of

development  plans,  giving  opportunities  for  interested  parties  to  object  or  make

representation  with  respect  to  plan  proposals.    In  the  case  of  Bermuda  and  Cayman

Islands, a tribunal is established to consider objections and representations in relation to

the physical development plan. Specifically, the Development and Planning Act 2017 in

the Cayman Islands has provision for a Development Plan Tribunal to consider objections

and representations on development plan amendments.

The  use  of  a  tribunal  to  consider  development  plan  amendments  would  facilitate  the

movement  of  the  Barbados  planning  system  to  being  a  more  transparent  and

participatory process. Also, the modernization of the process should give consideration

to the inclusion of digital (online) technology to deliver official notices to the public and

receive objections and representations from the public.

6)

Frequency of Review

According to Section 11(1) of the Act: At least once in every five years after the date on

which a development plan for the whole of the Island comes into operation, the CTP shall

carry out a fresh survey of the Island and submit to the Minister a report of the survey

together with proposals for any alterations or additions to the plan that appear to him to

be required. (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) the CTP may at any time submit to the

Minister proposals for such alterations or additions to any development plan as appear

to him to be expedient.

The first physical development plan for Barbados was prepared in 1971 and came into

operation  on  1976.  Subsequent  to  that,  Barbados  has  had  the  benefit  of  an  updated

28

physical development plan in 1986 (adopted in 1991), another update in 2003 (adopted in

2013) and a more recent revision drafted in 2017 (awaiting further directions for an official

process of public participation as defined in the Act).

The target of a five–year review has never been attained though Barbados is well ahead

of its CARICOM neighbours, some of whom are yet to approve their first national spatial

or physical development plan.  The Barbados system though outdated in its legislation is

apparently  still  working  to  produce  essential  policy  directions  for  development  and

investment activity. Across the region the five-year review period is reflected in many of

the  laws  governing  physical  development  planning.  However,  the  availability  of

resources to update a national physical plan every five years has been questioned by a

number of stakeholders as revealed in recent consultations on the reform of the planning

system. It is noted that in Singapore the national level strategic framework referred to as

their concept plan is reviewed every 10 years according to their current legislation. On

the other hand, the master plan in Singapore which gives more detailed policy guidance

for site developments is reviewed every 5 years.

Consideration should be given for Barbados to review its national physical development

plan every 10 years bringing the process more in line with the resource availability. The

review of comprehensive development plans (all second tier development plans) on a

five-year cycle should also be considered given the openness of this small economy and

vulnerability to global economic changes.

7)

Plan Implementation

The public perception of town planning is one that is dominated by development control.

This is understandable given that most members of the public come into contact with the

system mainly through the development control process.  However, development control

can be regarded as one element of development plan implementation.  The main elements

of development plan implementation can be listed as development control, compulsory

purchase, direct action by public bodies, fiscal measures and facilitation:

i.  Development control – The process of deciding planning applications is a crucial

element  of  implementing  the  vision  for  development  set  out  in  the  Physical

Development  Plan.    It  has  been  recommended  above  that  the  status  of  the

development plan should be strengthened by introducing a presumption that its

policies will be followed unless material considerations persuade otherwise.  This

29

will contribute clarity and more certainty to the development control process with

explanations necessary for any departure from policies set out in the PDP.
ii.  Compulsory Purchase – This can assist in delivering PDP policies.  The purchase

of  land  may  be  needed  to  provide  a  site  for  some  public  facility,  eg  a  school,

hospital, sports ground, etc or to provide infrastructure such as a road widening

scheme.    Alternatively,  compulsory  purchase  can  be  used  to  facilitate  some

private  sector  development  that  meets  the  PDP  objectives.    For  instance,  land

could be acquired as part of a site assembly exercise that would enable a private

sector project of key economic importance to proceed.  Government could either

retain  ownership  as  an  investment  in  the  project  or  sell  on  immediately  and

recover its costs.

iii.  Direct action by public bodies – It may be the statutory function of a Ministry or

statutory corporation to carry out capital investment to deliver specific projects

in the PDP.  Government could also consider making space available in empty

Government-owned  buildings  at  low  or  nominal  rates  on  condition  that  those

buildings are improved and brought back into use.

iv.

Fiscal measures – PDP policies may be delivered by a range of fiscal incentives or

penalties.    For  instance,  a  higher  rate  of  tax on  vacant  lots  or  empty  buildings

could  encourage  owners  to  either  develop  that  property  themselves  or  sell  to

someone who will develop it.  There could be similar penalties attached to unused

agricultural land.  Conversely, incentives could be used to encourage people to

carry out development in line with the PDP.  Such incentives could include tax

relief  for  investment  in  listed  buildings  or  for  various  energy  conservation  or

renewable  energy  measures.    The  use  of  these  measures  can  be  targeted  in  an

area-based  fashion,  eg  in  special  development  areas,  conservation  areas,  the

National Park or the UNESCO World Heritage Site.

v.  Through  its  contact  with  developers  and  investors  as  part  of  the  development

control  process,  the  TCDPO  is  in  a  position  to  encourage  and  promote

development that fits with the PDP objectives.  This activity may be difficult to

measure  but  can  be  very  effective.    TCDPO  staff  are  not  just  in  a  position  to

negotiate improvements to planning applications that are submitted but can also

guide applicants to other potential projects.

While  recognizing  that  the  TCDPO  is  always  going  to  be  working  under  pressure  to

process the workload of planning applications, it is recommended that there should be

30

an increased emphasis on other work that supports or promotes achievement of the PDP

objectives.

#### B.  Regulation of Land Development

1)

Extent of Regulatory Jurisdiction

The purpose of planning legislation, as stated succinctly in the long title to the existing

law, is to provide for the orderly and progressive development of land. Hence, the extent

of  the  jurisdiction  of  relevant  authority  depends  upon  the  meaning  of  the  terms

“development” and “land” as defined by the legislation.

The approach taken in the existing law, as well as in planning legislation throughout the

Commonwealth Caribbean and in Britain, is to define development in broad terms and

then  to  cut  down  the  broad  definition  by  specifying  matters  which  do  not  constitute

development.  The  broad  definition  has  three  limbs:  (1)  the  carrying  out  of  building,

engineering, mining or other operations in, on, over or under any land; (2) the making of

any material change is the use of any buildings or other land; and (3) the subdivision of

land. The matters which would fall within these broad categories but by definition do not

constitute development are three types of operations and three types of land uses. With

the  exception  of  the  subdivision  of  land,  which  is  not  included  in  the  definition  of

development in Britain, there is a great deal of existing jurisprudence on this definition

of development, including the exclusions to the definition, and it is not recommended

that it be changed, except as outlined below.

As regards “land”, the definition in the existing law includes the seabed underlying the

Territorial Waters of Barbados, as well as the foreshore and all land above the Low Water

Mark,  which  is  the  limit  of  planning  control  in  Britain.  This  innovation,  made  by  the

amendments to the Act in 1968, has since been adopted in other Caribbean SIDS which

have enacted  modern planning  legislation. This aspect of the regulatory jurisdiction is

expected  to  become  more  important  in  future  as  Barbados  seeks  to  develop  the  “blue

economy”.

2)  Building, Engineering, Mining and Other Operations

The term “operations” in the Act does not have its ordinary dictionary meaning, which

would include many active processes having no impact on the condition of land; but is

limited  to  works  of  the  specified  kinds  which  change  the  physical  characteristics  of

31

buildings or other land. Two areas of concern are that it has been held that the category

“other  operations”  does  not  include  demolition  operations,  for  which  planning

permission is not currently required in Barbados. This raised the risk that buildings of

cultural  heritage  significance  can  be  demolished  before  they  are  expressly  protected.

Additionally, it is essential that mining operations expressly include sand mining. These

issues need to be addressed in the new legislation.

As  regards  building  operations,  the  CTP  currently  refers  building  plans  to  the

department  of  the  Ministry  responsible  for  public  works  that  is  referred  to  as  the

Barbados Building Authority (although the draft legislation to establish such a statutory

authority  has  not  been  enacted).  This  department  vets  the  plans  for  conformity  to  the

(draft) Barbados Building  Code, to be made  under the  Standards Act, CAP.326A,  and

advises  the  CTP  accordingly.  There  is  notable  dissatisfaction  amongst  registered

professional  architects  and  engineers  concerning  the  manner  in  which  this  process  is

functioning and the institutional arrangements with respect to the Building Code are in

need of review.

Additionally, building plans must be approved by the Minister of Health pursuant to the

Building Regulations 1969 made under the Health Services Act, CAP.44. The minimum

requirements with respect to buildings, including requirements with respect to sanitary

conveniences, are set out in the Regulations. Regulation 4 provides that applications must

be processed within 42 days after receipt and may be refused or granted conditionally;

however  reason  must  be  given  for  refusal  or  the  imposition  of  conditions.  Such

applications are currently been processed by the Environmental Protection Department

(EPD), although this Department is no longer within the Ministry of Health, which raises

an  issue  concerning  the  validity  of  approvals  granted  by  the  EPD  on  behalf  of  the

Minister.

Hence,  there  is  at  present  some  redundancy  of  regulatory  controls  with  respect  to

building operations between the TCPDO and EPD, to which has been added the referral

of  building  plans  to  the  building  “Authority”  within  the  Ministry  of  Works.  The

desirability of consolidating these functions into one department which would function

as a “one-stop-shop” for the approval of building plans was discussed in the stakeholder

consultations. Given the current climate of inefficiency in the TCPDO, practitioners were

32

reluctant to agree to the allocation of additional functions with respect to the approval of

detailed building plans to that department.

3)  Material Change of Use

This expression is not defined in the existing legislation. The expression “change of use”

has  been  defined  in  legislation  elsewhere  in  the  region,  but  the  key  word  “material”

(meaning significant from a land use planning perspective) has not; however, there is an

abundance of case law on the subject of what constitutes a material change of use of a

building or other land. The concept is dynamic and would not benefit from the inclusion

of a restrictive definition in the new Act.

However, there are some inconsistencies in the existing legislation with respects to this

category of development, which need to be corrected in the new legislation. The land uses

which  are  excluded  from  the  definition  of  development  by  s.13(2)(d),  (e)  and  (f)  are

included  in  the  Second  Schedule  to  the  Development  Order  as  forms  of  Permitted

Development. This is incongruous; if these matters do not constitute development they

do not require permission either on an application for planning permission or by means

of permission granted via a Development Order. It is also recognized that the  existing

Use Classes Order is antiquated and in need of rationalization.

4)

Subdivision of Land

There is a very broad definition of the term “subdivision” in the existing law; however,

there is little jurisprudence of this subject as subdivision is not a form of development

subject  to  planning  control  in  Britain  or  in  some  Commonwealth  Caribbean  countries

with  very  dated  planning  legislation  (e.g.  Guyana  and  Jamaica).  For  this  reason,

subdivision control was never properly integrated into the existing planning legislation.

However,  subdivision  is  subject  to  regulatory  control  in  Canada  and  there  is  some

relevant case law from that jurisdiction. Express provisions regarding subdivision have

been  included  in  the  modern  planning  legislation  adopted  in  several  Commonwealth

Caribbean countries (e.g. Bermuda, The Bahamas and Nevis).

It is recommended that adequate provisions with respect to the subdivision of land and

the provision, and future ownership and maintenance, of infrastructure and open spaces

in  subdivisions,  be  made  the  new  legislation.  This  could  also  distinguish  between  the

33

subdivision  of  raw  land  requiring  new  infrastructure  and  the  simple  division  or

severance of parcels into two or more lots which are already serviced.

5)

Classes of Applications

Under  the  existing  legislation,  there  are  two  classes  of  applications  for  planning

permission, outline applications and full or final applications. Outline applications are

provided for by Paragraph 6 of the Development Order. This provides for the grant of

permission,  which  may  be  conditional,  for  all  aspects  of  the  proposed  development

except the matters which are expressly reserved for subsequent approval.  The existing

practice with respect to outline approval is not ideal, as there is a failure to distinguish

clearly  between  the  general  conditions  subject  to  which  approval  is  granted  and  the

reserved matters. It should be noted that, since outline approval constitutes full and final

approval of the development other than as respects reserved matters, under the present

law  the  revocation  or  modification  of  outline  approval  can  attract  liability  for  the

payment of compensation by the Minister.

Additionally, at present the power to grant outline approval is limited to applications for

building operations. It is self-evident that developers proposing to undertake other forms

of development by way of operations and/or subdivision may wish to seek approval in

principle  for  such  developments,  before  incurring  the  costs  of  detailed  engineering

and/or architectural designs and environmental impact assessment studies. This should

be rectified in the new legislation. It would also be advisable to limit the liability of the

Crown with respect to the modification or revocation of such approval in principle.

Another dimension has been introduced with respect to classes of applications in some

recent  legislation  in  the  region,  which  distinguish  between  “simple”  and  “complex”

applications for the purposes of regulatory requirements for their processing. The idea of

introducing this distinction in the new planning legislation in Barbados found favor with

participants in the stakeholder consultations held in July 2018. These categories will have

to be carefully defined and the requirements with respect to each category of applications

clearly set out in the new legislation.

It is recommended that –

  There should be a differentiation between the systems for processing simple and

complex plans

34

  The current provisions for the grant of outline approval for building operations

should  be  replaced  by  a  system  of  approval  in  principle  for  any/all  types  of

development

  Approval in principle should not constitute full and final approval and should be

conditional  and  revocable  on  prescribed  grounds,  without  liability  for  the

payment of compensation



In  cases  where  EIA  is  required,  approval  in  principle  could  be  granted  on

submission of an initial environmental evaluation, subject to full EIA studies being

carried out when detailed plans are submitted

6)

Permitted Development

Section 15 of the Act allows the Minister to make a Development Order to provide for the

grant of planning permission. The Development Order may cover the whole of Barbados

or  any  part  of  it  and  may  either  grant  permission  for  a  development  or  a  class  of

development specified in the order or provide for the grant of permission by the CTP on

application  made  to  him.  Permission  can  be  granted  unconditionally  or  subject  to

conditions or limitations specified in the order.

The categories of Permitted Development are set out in the Town and Country Planning

Development Order 1972.  This order has had minor amendments over the years with the

last  amendment  being  in  1997.  The  provisions  of  the  Development  Order  concerning

Permitted Development are set out in paragraph 3 of the Order and the Second Schedule

to the Order. This Schedule contains several Parts. Part I contains a listing of the Classes

of development for which permission is granted by the Order and the conditions subject

to  which  such  permission  is  granted.  These  conditions  include  reference  to  Standard

Conditions which are set out in Part 2 of the Schedule and cross reference is made in the

Standard Conditions to the Road Classification in Part III of the Schedule. Additionally

Part IV of the Schedule (mistakenly) defines the Use Classes to which the exception in

section  13(2)(f)  of  the  Act  applies,  which  ought  not  to  form  part  of  the  Schedule  on

Permitted Development.

In reviewing the system, consideration has  been given to the current UK system from

which it was originally derived, other Caribbean countries and Bermuda.  Many of the

Caribbean countries are working on similar outdated legislation although Trinidad and

Tobago updated its order in 2015 and the UK equivalent was also revised in 2015.

35

It is clear that the current order is in need of review.  There are many activities which are

not effectively covered such as renewable energy and areas which need to be expanded

and other areas which could be removed.  The standard conditions applied to permitted

development are equally out of date and need an overhaul. The road classifications used

in the order have not been updated to reflect current conditions and the water protection

zones are similarly outdated.  Provisions for water use and storage are currently under

review and would also need amendment. The requirement of standard condition 4 for

the  CTP  to  be  notified  of  commencement  of  work  to  allow  inspection  could  also  be

reconsidered.

Similarly, the existing Use Class Order would benefit from refinement. For example, the

current  classification,  includes  restaurants  with  shops  whereas  the  UK  legislation  has

separate classes for both restaurants and cafes and fast food takeaways.  It might also be

sensible to separate offices into different categories to reflect the nature of their uses and

compatibility with other uses.  Warehouses that store hazardous materials might benefit

from being classified separately from other warehouses. There is currently no separate

class  for  residential.  Rather  than  including  the  Use  Class  Order  as  a  schedule  to  the

Development Order it would be preferable for this to be a separate Order.

A proposal raised during the consultation process is that in order to reduce the workload

of  the  Planning  Department  a  new  category  of  Certified  Development  could  be

introduced.  This  would  involve  approved  private  sector  professional  consultants

certifying that development of a single dwelling in a previously approved subdivision

met all the required standards.  This would reduce the need for site inspection and speed

up the approval process for residential applications and at the same time free up staff to

devote time to more complex cases and to enforcement work. Before drafting of the new

orders  it  would  be  sensible  to  consult  officers  in  TCDPO  and  the  BTPS  for  their

recommendations.

Producing a new Development Order provides an opportunity to bring up to date our

existing regulations, reflecting changes that  have occurred and current demands.  It is

important to use this opportunity not only to improve our existing system and correct

current failings but to consider future requirements of the system which are impacted on

by climate change and developing technologies.

Recommendations -

36

  To consult with the TCDPO and the BTPS on revisions to the schedule of

permitted development to ensure that the current list is fit for purpose now and

where possible is future-proofed

  To review the existing Use Class Order and produce a new order that reflects

current and future uses

  To update standard conditions in consultation with the Barbados Water

Authority, the Ministry of Transportation and Works, the Coastal Zone

Management Unit, the Environmental Protection Department and any other

relevant department or agency

  To consider if permitted development rights should apply across the island or

whether certain areas eg the Scotland District, the UNESCO World Heritage Site

or Conservation Areas should be excluded.

  Consider introducing a new category of Certified Development

7)  Routine Decisions on Planning Applications

Under the existing  Act, the CTP has the power to determine applications for planning

permission, except in cases where particular applications or classes of applications are to

be  referred  to  the  Minister  for  determination,  pursuant  to  directions  published  in  the

Official Gazette.

In dealing with such applications, the CTP has the power to prescribe the form on which

applications  are  to  be  made,  and  the  drawings  and  other  particulars  which  must  be

submitted. By virtue of an amendment made to the Act in 1998, these particulars may

include an assessment of the impact that the development may have on the environment

of Barbados (an EIA). Additionally, the CTP has the power to require the applicant to

submit “such further information as he thinks fit”. Pursuant to the Development Order,

the  CTP  is  mandated,  before  granting  planning  permission,  to  consult  with  various

statutory  boards  or  persons,  and  the Minister  has  the  discretion  to  require  the CTP  to

consult  additional  bodies  or  persons.  The  CTP  may  also  be  required  to  consult  with

specific persons by virtue of the provisions of other legislation, (e.g. The Director of the

Coastal  Zone  Management  Unit  by  virtue  of  s.33(3)  of  the  Coastal  Zone  Management

Act).

When the application requirements have been complied with, the CTP is empowered to

grant  planning  permission,  unconditionally  or  subject  to  conditions,  or  to  refuse

37

permission, having regard to the provisions of the development plan, so far as material

to  the  application,  and  to  any  other  material  considerations,  giving  reasons  for  that

decision. This is a very wide discretionary power, which is amplified by the absence of

prescribed development standards and the power of the CTP to relax such standards as

are contained in published policy documents, including the development plan.

This system is far from satisfactory. It can be criticized as being opaque and lending itself

to influence peddling and personal corruption; but it is also highly inefficient. Besides the

EIA  process  (referred  to  below),  the  principal  identifiable  sources  of  delay  are  the

statutory  process  of  inter-agency  consultation  with  referral  agencies  (also  discussed

below) and the exercise of the power to ask for additional information. In practice the

time allowed for the receipt of comments from the referral agencies bears no relationship

to the 14 to 21 days allowed by law for the receipt of such advice. Further, requests for

additional  information  can  be  and  are  made  sequentially  rather  than  up-front,  which

leads to interminable postponements of decisions on complex applications.

It is recommended that -

  The  TCPDO  should  retain  the  responsibility  for  processing  all  applications  for

planning permission;

  Strict time lines should be in place for the processing of applications, which may

vary according to the type of applications;

  The power to ask for additional information should be exercised upon submission

of applications and the running of time for the processing of applications should

not commence until such information has been provided;

  Any  consultations  with  referral  agencies  must  be  carried  out  expeditiously  in

accordance with fixed time limits;

  Where  applicable,  public  consultations  must  be  carried  out  expeditiously  in

accordance with fixed time limits;

  The  power  to  approve  applications,  conditionally  or  unconditionally,  of  refuse

permission  for  development  should  be  vested  in  a  multidisciplinary  statutory

Board – a Sustainable Development Board - comprised of ex officio members and

private sector members appointed by the Minister

  The CTP should serve as the CEO of the Sustainable Development Board

38

8)  Ministerial Decisions

The current arrangements for dealing with planning applications which are “called-in”

or referred to the Minister for determination are much criticised for contributing to delay

in matters which are often of significant economic importance.  The current arrangements

are  also  lacking  in  openness  and  transparency  with  little  regard  for  rules  of  natural

justice.  The process is not adequately managed - staff in the PMO and TCDPO perform

in  a  reactive  rather  than  pro-active  manner  and  there  are  no  performance  targets  or

deadlines.

Section 18 is the provision of the current Act which provides for the referral of specific

applications or classes of applications to the Minister for decision, instead of being dealt

with by the CTP.  At present these are all applications in respect of beachfront properties

and all applications for the sub-division or material change of use of agricultural land of

over 2 acres.  These categories were set 32 years ago by a Direction (SI 1986/103) and have

not been revised since.  Although s.18(1) of the Act allows for the Minister to give the

CTP  directions  to  refer  “any  application”  to  the  Minister  for  determination,  all  such

directions  must  be  published  in  the  Official  Gazette  pursuant  to  s.2(4)  and  there  is  no

record of this having been done.

Applications in the two specified categories may include important developments from

a strategic economic or environmental viewpoint.  However, as currently defined, they

may also include trivial matters which do not necessarily require the Minister’s attention.

Also, developments of strategic economic or environmental importance, which should

probably  attract  the  attention  of  the  Minister,  are  not  limited  to  the  two  categories

specified.

The  administration  of  the  s.18  process  has  been  made  more  difficult  by  aspects  of  the

judgment of the High Court in the case of St. Hill v Chief Town Planner and Attorney

General, No.1617 of 2011, Judgment of Cornelius J. 25th November 2016, with regard to

change  of  use  and  development  of  agricultural  land  at  Six  Men’s  Plantation,  St  Peter.

Problematic aspects of this judgment were never appealed and separate administrative

arrangements were put in place, in accordance with the judgment, to process applications

referred  to  the  Minister  within  the  PMO.  The  time  limit  for  appealing  the  judgment

having  expired,  legislation  is  now  needed  to  clarify  that  the  Minister  can  expect  the

39

TCPDO to process such applications (including conducting statutory consultations) and

also give a professional opinion on the planning issues.

As is the case with appeals against decisions of the CTP which are referred to the Minister

for review (see section 4.G infra), s.18(3) provides that, if either the applicant or the CTP

so  desire,  the  Minister  must  give  them  an  opportunity  of  appearing  before  and  being

heard by a person appointed for that purpose. Hence, most applications referred under

s.18  are  considered  in  a  hearing  chaired  by  a  “panellist”  appointed  by  the Minister  to

report on the matter.  The  hearings are not open to the public, there are no  published

rules of procedure, there is no regular way for third parties to intervene, there is no two-

way disclosure of documents in advance, the panellist’s report is not made available to

either the applicant or the CTP and under s.18 the Minister is under no obligation to give

reasons for his/her decision. Section 18(4) provides that the Minister’s decision is final;

however, such a decision may be challenged in the High Court on the grounds that it is

not within the powers of the Act, pursuant to s.72.

There  has  been  criticism  of  the  abilities,  knowledge  and  understanding  of  persons

appointed to conduct hearings.  The appointment process is opaque. There is no stated

requirement for qualifications or for a track record of relevant experience or knowledge

in  planning,  architecture,  engineering,  surveying,  law  or  other  related  land  use  or

relevant profession. Panellists are often lay people who have received little or no training

in  planning,  fair  hearing  procedures  or  the  nature  of  their  role.  It  is  not  known  what

weight is given to their reports by the Minister.

The objective of the referral process should be to provide a system which is both efficient

and at the same time fair, impartial, transparent and independent with no party being at

a  disadvantage  and  with  the  rules  of  natural  justice  complied  with.    In  deciding  on  a

framework for the future it is necessary to consider two main elements – governance and

management.  Governance arrangements will be established by the new Act while the

management  issues  will  be  addressed  partly  by  Regulations  and  partly  by  improved

management practices and training.

In relation to governance it is necessary to consider the extent and nature of Minister’s

direct involvement in decision-making on planning applications.  In most jurisdictions

there is a point at which the political leadership will want to have direct influence over

40

some planning matters by making a decision at the political level.  If this is done in an

open  and  transparent  way  with  publication  of  the  decision  and  its  justification  this  is

clearly  better  than  decision-making  behind  closed  doors  or  the  application  of  covert

influence.

The question then becomes one of which decisions should be determined at the political

level.  The current s18 categories are unsatisfactory.  It is suggested that the categories for

referral  should  be  broadly  defined  in  the  new  Act  as  “significant  departures  from  the

Physical  Development  Plan  and/or  proposed  developments  of  a  strategic  economic  or

environmental  importance”.    If  it  is  decided  to  proceed  with  the  establishment  of  a

Sustainable  Development  Board,  then  that  body  should  determine  whether  an

application should be referred to the Minister for decision.  The Board should make its

determination  taking  account  of  the  advice  of  the  CTP  and  in  consultation  with  the

Minister as necessary.

As the Minister will be making the decision on this class of applications, it is appropriate

that the Minister should receive a full written report on the case with a recommendation

from  the  person  who  conducts  the  hearing  (or  in  a  case  being  decided  on  written

representations  has  reviewed  all  relevant  information).

  For  this  reason,  it  is

recommended that a suitably qualified Inspector is appointed to deal with each case.  This

means  a  person  with  relevant  qualifications  and  experience  in  planning,  architecture,

engineering,  surveying,  law  or  other  related  land  use  or  relevant  profession.    If  it  is

decided to have a Planning Appeals Tribunal (as recommended in 4. G, below), then the

same  panel  of  qualified  persons  can  be  used  for  the  appointment  of  Inspectors  for

referrals.  All appointments to consider a particular case must follow a strict protocol on

conflicts of interest.

In  the  interests  of  efficiency  as  well  as  openness  and  transparency,  there  is  a  need  for

improvements to the way the referral process is managed.  Much of this was covered by

a consultants’ report in 2013 but the detailed recommendations will need to be adjusted

to match the provisions of the new Act.  Some, but not all, of these management changes

can be introduced by Regulations.  There is, however, a need for change in the overall

management approach which is a matter of culture and depends ultimately on leadership

from senior management in the TCDPO and the PMO.

41

The major requirements are:

#### o  A more pro-active management approach o  Adherence to strict time-tabling by all parties o  Holding Hearings in public o  Clarity and consistency in how Hearings or the Written Representations process

are conducted

#### o  Clarity and consistency in how site visits are conducted o  Early disclosure by all interested parties o  A focus on the issues in dispute, eg by establishing common ground o  Issuing any report prepared for the Minister to all parties involved o  Publication of all decisions with justification o  Training for all involved in the process.

9)  Development Standards

Given the Minister’s overriding responsibility to secure consistency and continuity in the

framing and execution of a comprehensive policy for the use and development of land, it

is  customary  for  site  development  standards  –  with  respect  to  building  line  set-backs,

coverage, density, building heights, parking requirements, etc  -  to be set out either in

statutory instruments or in official policy documents. At present, various fixed standards

are  prescribed  by  the  Development  Order  as  conditions  governing  permitted

development.  These mandatory standards do not apply to developments in respect of

which applications for planning permission are to be determined having regard to the

development plan and other material considerations.

In  the  UK  the  practice  used  to  be  that  Planning  Guidance  Notes  (subsequently  called

Planning  Policy Statements) were issued by the Minister for the guidance of the Local

Planning Authorities determining applications. It is well established in the jurisprudence

on planning legislation that such published policies (in contrast to unpublished “desk-

drawer”  policies)  are  “material  considerations”  to  be  taken  into  account  in  the

determination of applications. This does not mean that they are binding and the decision-

maker has the discretion to vary or waive  compliance with such standards where this

appears to be merited.

In some other jurisdictions, for example under the Tasmanian  Land Use Planning and

Approvals Act 1993, a more rigorous approach of issuing Planning Directives has been

adopted. Before their adoption, such Planning Directives must be published in draft for

42

public comment – which may include a public hearing – and notice of the issuance of any

such Directive by the Minister must be published in the Official Gazette. Upon adoption,

such Planning Directives become binding on planning authorities.

In Barbados, there are some existing development standards set out in documents such

as The Applicant’s Handbook and Guide to Town Planning, published by the TCPDO,

and The Applicant’s Handbook and Guide to Coastal Planning in Barbados, published

by the CZMU. These  would be legally  analogous to the published Planning  Guidance

Notes/Planning Policy Statements in the UK.

It is recommended that -

  The present practice of issuing policy documents which set out basic

development standards be retained

  However, such policy documents should be kept up to date and emanate from

the office of the Minister, who is responsible for consistency and continuity in the

formulation of policies for the use and development of land.

  Such policies should be published in draft for public comment before their

adoption by the Minister

  Notice should be given of the adoption of any such policy in the Official Gazette

10)  Environmental Impact Assessments

Principle 17 of the 1992 Rio Declaration on the Environment and Development declares

that  environmental  impact  assessments  (EIAs)  must  be  undertaken  for  proposed

activities which are likely to have an adverse effect on the environment and are subject

to a decision of a competent national authority. This global undertaking was echoed in

the Declaration of Barbados and Programme of Action for Small Island Developing States

(SIDS)  entered  into  at  the  1994  Global  Conference  on  the  Sustainable  Development  of

SIDS. In keeping with these international commitments, the Town and Country Planning

Act was amended in 1998 to make provision at s.17(1) for EIAs to be required by the CTP

in support of applications for planning permission for development which is “likely to

have an effect on the environment of Barbados”.

Hence, it has become the practice of the CTP to require EIAs to be submitted by applicants

in some instances. Some guidance with respect to the cases in which EIAs are required

by the CTP, the Terms of Reference (TOR) for EIA studies and the EIA process, including

public  participation  requirements,  are  contained  in  the  Physical  Development  Plan

43

(Amended) 2003, approved by Parliament, and the Applicant’s Handbook and Guide to

Town  Planning,  published  by  the  TCPDO  (which  is  out  of  print  and  not  available

electronically). However, these publications are both policy documents and to date a firm

legal framework for the EIA process is lacking. In this respect, as documented in a recent

study of the legislative framework for EIA in the Caribbean carried out by the Caribbean

Law  Institute  under  the  Impact  Justice  Project,  Barbados  is  lagging  behind  other

Commonwealth Caribbean countries.

EIAs are  costly and time consuming  and  it  is essential that  there is transparency with

respect to the cases in which EIAs are required and the EIA process, including the process

by which EIA reports are reviewed.

It is recommended that EIA Regulations should be made as a matter of urgency under

the new legislation. Such Regulations should provide clearly for –

  The cases in which EIAs are or can be required;
  The stage of the approval process at which EIAs (or different levels of EIA studies)

are required

  The preparation of the TORs for EIAs
  The carrying out of EIAs, including the qualifications of EIA preparers
  Public participation requirements
  The essential elements of EIA reports
  The mechanism for the review of EIA reports
  The  incorporation  of  terms  and  conditions  with  respect  to  mitigation  and

monitoring measures into planning permission

11)  Coastal and Seabed Developments

Given the definition of “land” in the existing law (which it is not suggested should be

amended)  planning  control  in  Barbados  extends  beyond  the  shoreline  to  the  seabed

within the Territorial Waters of Barbados. This area of planning control is cross-cut by

the  coastal  zone  as  defined  by  the  Coastal  Zone  Management  Act,  CAP.394,  which

provides  inter  alia,  for  the  preparation  of  a  Coastal  Zone  Management  Plan  (CZMP)

defining  the  Coastal  Zone  Management  Area.  Part  II  of  the  Act  sets  out  the  statutory

process for the preparation and approval of the CZMP, inclusive of the holding of a public

enquiry on the draft CZMP, approval of the plan by the Minister and the establishment

of the CZMP by Order published in the Official Gazette.

44

Several consequential amendments were made to the Town and Country Planning Act,

CAP.240, upon enactment of the Coastal Zone Management Act in 1998. For example,

s.15(1A) limits the power of the Minister to grant planning permission via a Development

Order  for  any  development  within  the  Coastal  Zone  Management  Area  which  is

prohibited by the CZMP. Likewise s.17(1A) provides that the CTP must request an EIA

where  proposed  development  is  in  a  Coastal  Zone  Management  Area.  None  of  these

provisions  have  come  into  effect  to  date  because  the  draft  CZMP,  which  has  been  in

existence for many years, has never been through the required process of public enquiry,

Ministerial approval and publication of an Order in the Official Gazette.

Nevertheless, the CZMU now plays a pivotal role in the processing of applications for

planning  permission  for  coastal  development,  whether  such  applications  fall  to  be

decided  by  the  CTP  or  the  Minister.  Their  policies  are  set  out  in  a  publication,  The

Applicant’s Handbook and Guide to Coastal Planning in Barbados, an electronic copy

of which is available on their website. This document includes reference to the CZMP,

which is not available in either electronic or print form, without acknowledgment of the

fact that the plan is not an approved plan. In the Handbook the CZMU acknowledges

that  regulatory  jurisdiction  over  coastal  development  is  in  the  hands  of  the  planning

authorities;  however,  in  practice  the  CTP’s  decisions  and  advice  to  the  Minister  with

respect to coastal applications follow the CZMU’s advice, even with respect to matters

outside of their area of technical competence.

It is recommended that –

  The CZMU should be called upon to subject the draft CZMP – including the

delimitation  of  the  coastal  zone  -  to  the  statutory  processes  for  public

consultation and approval provided for by the CZM Act;

  The  role  of  the  CZMU  in  decision-making  on  applications  for  planning

permission within the coastal zone should be clarified;

  Consideration  should  be  given  in  this  context  to  the  role  that  the  CZMU

should play with respect to applications for proposed developments on the

seabed outside of the coastal zone.

12)  Conservation of Built Heritage

Barbados has a wealth of heritage assets which provides a very valuable heritage tourism

product.  However, much of the built heritage is in poor condition and at risk of loss.  The

45

existing legislation is weak and very limited and the penalties for non-compliance are so

low  that  they  provide  no  deterrent.    The  designation  of  the  UNESCO  World  Heritage

status  for  Bridgetown  and  its  Historic  Garrison  recognises  the  importance  of  this  key

asset, but does not provide the protection or tools to maximise its potential.

Sections  28,  29  and  30  of  the  Act  contain  the  existing  provisions  for  making  Building

Preservation Orders (s.28), compiling a list of buildings of special architectural or historic

interest (s.29) and requires the owner of a listed building to give the CTP at least 2 months

notice of any proposal to carry out works to demolish or alter/extend a listed building

(s.30).

Although the provisions of the Building Preservation Order are stronger  - in that they

require consent for work to a historic building  - they involve the service of individual

notices,  which  is  time  consuming  and  the  provisions  are  rarely  used.    The  Listed

Buildings  list  is  not  comprehensive  and  needs  updating  and  there  are  no  provisions

within the legislation for designation of heritage conservation areas.

In many other jurisdictions the demolition, alteration or extension to a listed building is

considered  to  be  development  and  requires  either  planning  consent  or  specific  listed

building consent.  The Barbados National Trust has expressed a strong preference for the

status for Listed Buildings to be strengthened and for control of demolition to be included

in the definition of development.  If this is done, the existing provisions for the Building

Preservation Order are no longer required.  An applicant would have to apply for consent

for planning permission for demolition or alteration of a listed building and would have

the  same  rights  of  appeal  as  any  other  applicant  if  they  were  not  satisfied  with  the

decision or conditions attached.

There is clearly a need to update and review the list. The existing Act makes provision

for this to be done by either the Minister or the Barbados National Trust or other persons

or bodies.  The review of the list should be an open and consultative process and notices

should be served on the owners of properties.  The CTP has expressed the view that it

should  also  be  possible  to  list  part  of  a  building  or  features  of  special  architectural  or

historic interest and not only the entire building.

There is also no provision in the Barbados legislation to deal with the protection of the

character of historic areas and to designate heritage conservation areas.  The revised PDP

46

identifies a number of historic areas, but there are no specific powers in the legislation to

deal with formal designation of such areas or provisions to protect their character.

Section 2.2.5 of the PDP - Cultural Heritage is very comprehensive.  It identifies how the

Public Register of Historic Places will be prepared, updated with provisions for public

participation.  It also specifically identifies 6 designated Cultural Heritage Conservation

Areas:

1.  Historic Bridgetown and its Garrison
2.  Strathclyde
3.  Belleville
4.  Hastings Pavilion/Ocean View
5.  Speightstown
6.  Rock Hall

The  PDP  recommends  strict  controls  of  development

(including

trees  and

advertisements)  not  only  within  the  World  Heritage  site  and  Heritage  Conservation

Areas  but  adjacent  to  them.    There  is  also  a  requirement  for  a  Heritage  Impact

Assessment.    However,  as  under  the  existing  legislation  the  Plan  is  merely  a  material

consideration  it  is  unclear  what  legal  status  these  provisions  have.  There  is  also  a

recommendation  of  a  fine  of  up  to  $50,000  for  unauthorised  interventions  and

demolitions.

Given  the  importance  of  our  heritage  asset  it  is  important  that  it  is  afforded  greater

protection within the new legislation.

It is recommended that -

  The definition of development be extended to include demolition works
  Provisions for making, updating and making public the register of listed buildings

be strengthened and be made more transparent

  Provisions  are  made  for  the  formal  designation  of  heritage  conservation  areas

including the World Heritage Site

  Provisions  are  also  made  for  control  of  development  within  and  adjoining

conservation  areas  and  the  requirement  for  a  Heritage  Impact  Assessment  is

clarified

  The penalties for altering or demolishing a listed building are included as part of

the more comprehensive schedule of penalties.

47

  Consideration  be  given  to  having  a  sub-committee  of  the  Sustainable

Development Board to advise the Board on design and conservation of the built

heritage.

13)  Urban Design

Increasingly  the  issue  of  urban  design  is  seen  as  an  important  consideration  in  the

planning process and in place making.  Good urban design is about more than individual

buildings, it is about the relationship between buildings and the spaces between them.

The current planning system in Barbados has little emphasis on design at the national

physical planning level which is more of a strategic approach to the overall development

of the island.  At this scale, there are blanket policy guidelines for density and in some

areas heights, as well as road reserves and building lines and set backs. The current five

storey  limit  for  beach  front  development  has  led  to  a  monotonous  uniformity  and

provided little scope for innovative design.

This approach has been taken in the context of a very discretionary legislative framework

which  allows  the  TCDPO  to  use  professional  judgements  to  impose  site-specific

guidance. This discretionary approach has not always had sustainable design outcomes.

In  the  recently  revised  Barbados  Physical  Development  Plan,  at  the  more  detailed

physical  plan  levels  such  as  community  planning,  there  are  policies  which  set  out  an

approach to design which considers issues such as vernacular style, sustainable building

design and height and massing of new buildings.  There is increasing pressure for high

buildings and  in the community plans the Barbados Physical Development Plan Draft

2017, there is direction on where it would be appropriate to have them based on current

conditions.    Integrating high buildings into sensitive historic environments is a challenge

faced  by  many  cities.    Those  who  have  been  successful  at  integrating  modern

development into the historic fabric have usually had clear policies on how this should

be done.

In  Barbados  it  is  important  that  we  continue  to  understand  the  development  and

economic  pressures  which  drive  modern  development  and  the  needs  to  balance  this

against the need to preserve our heritage and the character that makes Barbados unique.

There is no blanket height policy that will fit every section of a development precinct as

the overall purpose, functionality, aesthetics and amenity of the area must be considered.

48

It is recommended that the extensive urban design policies developed as part of the work

of the Barbados Physical Development Plan Draft 2017 and presented within the context

of nine community plans, be revisited as required, and extended to include other critical

development  zones  in  order  to  develop  further  guidance/standards  appropriate  to

Barbados.  These could take the form of Supplementary Planning Documents as part of

the  Development  Planning  Process  and/or  through  planning  directives.    The  new  act

should make provision for this by allowing such Supplementary Planning Documents to

be adopted as part of the Physical Development Plan.

14)  Derelict and Vacant Buildings and Land

In planning for the orderly use of land it is important to ensure that land is used for its

intended purpose.  Barbados has a limited supply of land but there are large numbers of

buildings which are vacant and derelict and subdivisions where lots remain vacant for

decades.  This is a very inefficient use of resources. Vacant lots need to be serviced and

the  infrastructure  and  utilities  maintained.    Long  term  vacancies  lead  to  dereliction,

damage the amenity of the neighbourhood and can also be a health hazard. The presence

of  derelict  buildings  (both  residential  and  commercial)  has  a  negative  impact  on  the

appearance of the island. Vacant lots that are not maintained become overrun by bush,

cow-itch and vermin and have a detrimental effect on residential subdivisions.

What  is required is a  strategy to bring  these wasted resources back into use.  In other

jurisdictions the development and use of proactive Empty Property Strategies have had

real  success.    These  work  on  the  basis  of  actively  encouraging  owners  to  bring  the

properties back to use but as a last resort can use compulsory powers to acquire or force

the sale of the property.  Tools need to be put in place to facilitate this work although the

threat of compulsory action is often sufficient to bring about change.

It is recommended that

  Consideration  is  given  to  developing  and  implementing  an  Empty  Property

Strategy

  Provision is made for the use of compulsory powers where necessary to support

this strategy.

49

15)  Tree Preservation

Section 27 of the Act contains provisions for the making of Tree Preservation Orders to

protect  trees,  groups  of  trees  and  woodlands  in  the  interests  of  amenity  or  of  soil

conservation. The section sets out the particulars to be included in and the procedure for

making of such orders, inclusive of publication of a notice of intention to make any such

order and the consideration of objections and representations, before the Order can be

made. No such Orders have ever been made, but in 1981 separate legislation, the Trees

(Preservation) Act, CAP. 397, was adopted without any amendment having been made

to the provisions of section 27.

Under  this  legislation  a  person  who  wished  to  kill  a  tree  the  circumference  of  which

exceeds one metre at a point half a metre from the ground, except a tree that poses an

imminent danger or is required to be removed under other legislation, must apply to the

CTP for permission. The CTP is allowed 28 days to approve such applications. The effect

of these provisions was to reverse the obligation imposed on the Minister by s.27 of the

Act  to take proactive measures for tree  preservation and impose an obligation to seek

approval  upon  persons  wishing  to  fell  trees  to  which  the  Act  applies.  It  offers  no

protection  to  important  species  such  as  palms  and  mangroves,  which  do  not  attain  a

metre in girth. However, the Act also contains an important provision which vests the

CTP with additional powers to require the owners of land to plant trees on vacant land,

or land abutting a public road, or land on which a new road is to be built (e.g. within

subdivisions). This is backed up by a provision whereby the CTP may require a developer

to  deposit  a  sum  of  money  in  the  Treasury  as  security  for  implementing  landscaping

conditions of planning permission.

Tree preservation orders are potentially useful in preserving the amenity of conservation

areas and other sensitive areas, but the provisions of these two Acts need to be reconciled.

It is recommended that -

a)  The tree preservation order provisions be retained in the new Act
b)  The  Trees (Preservation) Act be repealed and its provisions  incorporated in the

new Town and Country Planning Act

c)  A more appropriate definition of “tree” be used in the new legislation

50

d)  All  powers  and  duties  assigned  to  the  Minister  under  these  provisions  be

transferred to the Sustainable Development Board if one is established.

#### C.  Planning Obligations

The concept of planning obligations (sometimes referred to as contributions or planning

gain) was introduced into Barbados planning law  by the Town and Country Planning

(Amendment)  Act,  Act  No.  51  of  2007,  which  inserted  a  new  part,  Part  IVA,  into  the

existing  law.  As drafted,  s.32F, which provides for agreements between applicants for

planning  permission  and  the  Crown  with  respect  to  planning  obligations,  relates

specifically to the provision of affordable housing. In other countries planning obligations

can extend to other elements of physical and social infrastructure and to environmental

enhancements.  Even  in its limited form, s.32F has not been used because  Regulations

with respect to planning obligations have not yet been made pursuant to s.32H.

Planning  obligations  are  usually  connected  to  the  grant  of  planning  permission  and  it

may  be  a  condition  of  planning  permission  that  a  developer  enters  into  a  planning

obligations  agreement.    Planning  obligations  resemble  planning  conditions  but  can

achieve planning objects that cannot be achieved by planning conditions.  For instance,

planning obligations can fund off-site infrastructure.  Developers may agree to carry out

specified works themselves or pay a commuted sum equivalent to the agreed cost of the

works.  In the UK there is also a Community Infrastructure Levy which is a tariff-based

approach to collecting the contribution.

The criticism often levelled at planning obligations is that they can equate to the buying

and  selling  of  planning  permissions.    Policy  in  Britain  addresses  this  by  requiring

planning obligations to assist in mitigating the impact of unacceptable development and

make it acceptable in planning terms.  Planning obligations may only constitute a reason

for  granting  permission  if  they  meet  the  tests  that  they  are  necessary  to  make  the

development  acceptable  in  planning  terms,  directly  related  to  the  development,  and

fairly and reasonably related in scale and kind.  This policy is incorporated in Regulations

and  is  based  on  case  law.    Local  planning  authorities  are  expected  to  include  their

planning  obligations  policies  in  development  plans  and  keep  details  of  all  planning

obligations agreements and their discharge in the planning register.

51

Planning obligations could be used in Barbados to fund a range of physical, social and

environmental requirements, including for instance:

#### o  Affordable housing – either on-site as part of a large development or elsewhere

following a contribution on a tariff basis

#### o  Junction and other highways improvements linked to traffic generation by a new

development

#### o  New  or  enhanced  public  beach  access  and  facilities  related  to  beachfront

development

#### o  Boardwalk extensions related to beachfront development o  Additional class rooms or school facilities related to new residential development o  Environmental mitigation measures during construction and after completion of

a development.

It  is  recommended  that  the  new  planning  legislation  contains  broader  measures  for

planning obligations.

#### D.  Limitation Periods

The existing law specifies certain deadlines by which various steps should be taken  by

the CTP and others with respect to the administration and enforcement of the Act. As

regards  the  processing  of  applications,  the  law  provides  that  the  CTP  must  make  a

decision on an application within 2 calendar months of submission. Within this period

the CTP may allow agencies with which statutory consultations must be carried out 14 to

21  days  to  comment  on  the  application.  These  deadlines  are  never  met.  Due  to  an

amendment made to the Act in 1981, the CTP no longer has to ask the applicant to agree

to an extension of the time limit for determination of the application. The only recourse

that the applicant has is to appeal to the Minister pursuant to section 20 of the Act, on the

grounds that the application is deemed to have been refused after the elapse of 2 months.

This is never done as there are no deadlines for the processing of appeals to the Minister,

which may take even longer to be determined.

This  is  an  area  where  we  can  learn  from  experience  elsewhere.    In  the  UK  poor

performance by Local Planning Authorities led to a major review in the 1990s and targets

were  set  and  monitored  with  the  results  published  in  a  league  table.  Penalties  and

rewards  were  applied  to  influence  performance.    This  resulted  in  an  improvement  in

52

performance.  The current English standards included in the 2015 General Development

Order  are  8  weeks  for  a  simple  application,  13  weeks  for  major  developments  and  16

weeks where an application is subject to an EIA.  There is also a non-statutory “planning

guarantee” reflecting Government policy that no application should spend more than a

year with decision-makers, including any appeal.

It is absolutely essential to efficiency of the regulatory process that the relevant authority

has deadlines for processing  applications, that such deadlines  be realistic and that  the

applicant has meaningful recourse if they are not met.  It is clear that large applications

are much more complex now than they were in the 1960s when the original 2 months

time  limit  was  set  and  this  should  be  reflected  in  the  proposed  deadlines.    The

introduction  of  the  new  Sustainable  Development  Board  will  also  require  that

applications are processed in line with its meeting cycles.

It is recommended that –

  The  deadlines  of  2  months  for  the  determination  of  applications  should  be

replaced by a tiered system of 8 weeks for simple developments, 13 weeks for

major developments and 16 weeks if an EIA is required.

  The running of time for this limitation period should start from the time when

the applicant has submitted a completed application, inclusive of an EIA and any

other additional information (when required)

  The deadline of 14 to 21 days for the receipt of comments from referral agencies

should be retained

  The  relevant  authority  should  have  to  get  the  applicant’s  agreement  to  any

extension of this deadline for decision-making

  Either the application should be deemed approved at the expiry of the limitation

period or the applicant should have meaningful recourse against the delay.  Such

recourse could take the form of an appeal to the Appeal Tribunal

  Where  it  is  clear  at  the  outset  that  an  extended  period  would  be  necessary  to

process an application, the CTP and the applicant should consider entering into

a planning performance agreement before the application is submitted.

53

E.  Enforcement

Under the existing legislation there is a suite of measures that can be taken by the CTP to

enforce compliance with planning control. However, the CTP must initiate enforcement

proceedings within 4 years of the unauthorized development having been carried out.

Where  development  is  carried  out  without  planning  permission  or  in  breach  of  the

conditions subject to which such permission was granted, the CTP may serve the owner

and occupier of the land with an Enforcement Notice setting out the breach of planning

control committed and the steps the developer must take to remedy the breach. Where

the development consists of or includes the carrying out of building or other operations,

the CTP may also serve a Stop Notice requiring works for the development cited in the

Enforcement  Notice  to  cease  immediately.  If  the  developer  fails  to  comply  with  the

Enforcement Notice within the specified time, the CTP may enter upon the land and take

the steps required by the Notice and recover the cost of doing so from the owner of the

land. The person served may also be prosecuted and fined for non-compliance with an

Enforcement  Notice  or  a  Stop  Notice.  Enforcement  notices  are  subject  to  the  strict

interpretation standards applicable  in the criminal law because  they may lead to such

convictions and penalties.

The options open to a person served with an Enforcement Notice are to comply with the

notice; to appeal to a Judge in Chambers against the notice on any of several grounds

specified in the Act; to challenge the validity of the notice by way of a defence to summary

proceedings  in  the  Magistrate’s  Court  for  breach  of  the  notice;  or  by  way  of  Judicial

Review proceedings in the High Court on grounds other than those which could have

been raised on an appeal to a Judge in Chambers. There is no means of challenging a Stop

Notice short of Judicial Review proceedings in the High Court. In the event that a Stop

Notice or the Enforcement Notice on which it is based is held to be invalid, the Crown is

liable for the losses incurred by the developer arising from the stoppage of works.

The major issues arising with respect to these provisions of the existing law are that the

CTP has the discretion as to whether to take enforcement action in any instance and the

courts will not enquire into how this discretion has been exercised. This is a source of

concern as to whether it is being exercised fairly. Secondly, the CTP is in the practice of

initiating  demolition  action  after  the  expiry  of  the  time  limit  for  compliance  with

Enforcement  Notices  without  having  vindicated  such  notices  by  prosecution  of  the

developer in the Magistrate’s Court. This is inadvisable as, if the Notice is proved to be

54

invalid in Judicial Review proceedings the Crown would be liable to pay the developer

compensation,  which  may  be  appreciable  particularly  if  a  Stop  Notice  has  also  been

served.  Thirdly,  the  existing  fines  for  breaches  of  Enforcement  and  Stop  Notices  are

trivial.

Participants  in  the  stakeholder  consultations  supported  the  retention  of  the  4  year

limitation  period  for  the  initiation  of  enforcement  proceedings  in  Barbados;  however,

they opined that there should be transparency with respect to how the CTP exercises the

discretion to take such proceedings, so that complainants can find out what is being done

and,  if  no  enforcement  action  is  taken,  the  reasons  why.  It  was  also  agreed  that

enforcement powers need to be exercised with greater care, having regard to the liability

for the Crown which may result where it is proved that Enforcement Notices are flawed

or have not been served in the correct manner. The lack of a public register of enforcement

actions  was  also  identified  as  a  problem,  which  gives  rise  to  the  present  practice  of

requesting certificates of compliance as part of conveyancing practice.

It is recommended that –

  The 4 year limitation period should be retained
  The  relevant  authority  should  have  to  succeed  in  a  prosecution  based  on  an

Enforcement Notice before exercising the power of demolition

  The  grounds  on  which  an  Enforcement  Notice  can  be  appealed  to  a  Judge  in

Chambers should not be limited

  Provision should be made for appeal against Stop Notices, to avoid the necessity,

costs and delays associated with Judicial Review proceedings

  Enforcement and Stop Notices should  be prepared and served by persons with

adequate training in legal requirements and procedures

  The CTP should keep a publicly accessible register of Enforcement Action which

should be available on-line

  The CTP should report to the Sustainable Development Board on complaints of

breaches and enforcement action taken.

55

F.  Administrative Fees & Penalties

a)  Administrative Fees

The Town and Country Planning (Fees) Regulations 1970 (S.I. 1970 No 181) introduced

the concept of charging of fees for planning applications and set fee levels.  The scale of

fees remained in place for 23 years until amended by the Town and Country Planning

(Fees) (Amendment) Regulations 2009.  That fee scale has been unchanged for the last 9

years.

The concept of charging fees to cover the administrative cost of processing applications

is  well  established.    The  scale  of  fees  charged  should  reflect  the  cost  of  delivering  the

function but also should be proportionate to the scale and nature of the development.

The  existing  structure  seeks  to  do  this  by  making  some  charges  related  to  the  square

footage of the development.  The charge for a chattel house has remained for some time

at the nominal $10 limit.  However, a residential property of 2,000 sq. ft. would pay the

same fees as a 30,000 sq. ft. luxury villa.   There might be a need to make adjustments to

thresholds and categories to respond to changing circumstances.

The fees for retrospective applications are double that of an application made in advance

of development. At present there are no fees applied to hearings for appeals and referrals

to the Minister to cover the additional cost of the hearing.

Increasingly developers are requiring pre-application discussions on large and complex

projects.  This is an important aspect of the facilitation role that the planning department

is expected to play.  It can be non-productive if such  work is speculative and does not

result in an application.  It would be possible to charge for this activity in advance of an

application and deduct the cost from the final fee.

It is important that fee structures should be kept up to date and reviewed.  This would

enable inflation in costs to be accommodated, but would also allow for consideration to

be given to changes in circumstances which will occur from time to time.  For example,

the 2009 revision introduced a new class for marinas to reflect the expensive nature of the

technical assessments required for that type development.

It is recommended that a new schedule of fees should be prepared and once approved

should  be  reviewed  annually  by  the  Sustainable  Development  Board  and  changes  (if

necessary) recommended to the Minister for approval.

56

b)  Penalties and Fines

Similarly  out  of  date  are  the  penalties  and  fines  for  breaches  in  planning  regulations.

These have not been updated since the original legislation and are so low that they do

not have any deterrent value.  For example, the fine for demolishing a Listed Building is

a  mere  $500  while  non-compliance  with  Enforcement  Orders  only  results  in  fines  of

$1,000 plus daily charges.

A review should be made of all existing penalties, including fines, to bring them in line

with  other  similar  offences  and  where  fines  are  the  penalty  they  should  regularly  be

updated to take into account inflation and changing attitudes to the offence.  This review

could also be undertaken by the Sustainable Development Board and recommendations

for change made as appropriate.  In addition, some form of inflation measure could be

automatically applied annually to the fine component of penalties.  While this would not

deal with the deterrent value of the penalty, it would ensure that once set they do not

become obsolete over time, as has happened with the current system.

#### G.  Appeals

As with planning applications referred to the Minister for decision (discussed in section

4.B.8 above), current arrangements for dealing with appeals against decisions taken by

the CTP are much criticised for contributing to delay. The current arrangements are also

lacking in openness and transparency with little regard for rules of natural justice and

the  process  is  not  well  managed.  Staff  in  the  TCPDO  and  PMO  perform  in  a  reactive

rather than pro-active manner and there are no performance targets or deadlines.

Section 19 of the Act provides for an applicant who is aggrieved by the decision made by

the  CTP,  either  to  refuse  planning  permission  or  against  conditions  subject  to  which

planning permission is granted, to request the CTP to refer the decision for review by the

Minister. Additionally, s.20 extends the right to appeal to the Minister under s.19 to cases

in which the CTP has failed to determine an application within the two-month limitation

period set by  s.20(1) and Regulation 7.  However, as the appeal route  is no  faster than

waiting for a decision from the CTP, it is almost unknown for applicants to invoke their

right to appeal under s.20.

57

The provisions of the  existing  legislation regarding  the procedure to be followed with

respect to appeals to the Minister are vague, inadequate and have allowed for the lack of

a time-bound, fair and transparent appellate procedure to be followed.

Regulation 9(1) provides that the applicant must make the request in writing with 28 days

receipt of the decision, stating the grounds of appeal; however, as regards the deadlines

for  action  by  the  CTP,  s.19(3)  of  the  Act  provides  only  that,  when  such  a  request  is

received,  the  CTP  must  refer  it  to  the  Minister  with  “all  reasonable  dispatch”  and

Regulation  9(3)  provides  that  the  CTP  must  furnish  the  Minister  with  copies  of  the

relevant  documents,  including  a  statement  of  his/her  observations  on  the  request,  “as

soon  as  practicable”.  Section  19(6)  provides  that,  if  either  the  applicant  or  the  CTP  so

desire, the Minister permit them to having a hearing before a person appointed by the

Minister for that purpose. There are no provisions in the Act or Regulations governing

the qualifications for the appointment of persons to conduct hearings or the procedures

for  the  conduct  of  such  hearings,  reporting  by  the  person  conducting  the  hearing  or

decision-making  by the  Minister. Further, under  s.19(9), the Minister  is only bound to

give a statement of reasons for his/her decision if expressly requested by the applicant.

Hence, the existing law and practice does not conform to basic rules of natural justice.

There is no urgency on the part of the CTP with regard to the referral of appeals to the

Minister, the delay being attributed to the necessity to prepare the CTP’s memorandum

with respect to the application, for which there is no deadline. Section 19 hearings are not

open to the public, there are no  settled rules of procedure; there is no regular way for

third parties to intervene; there is no two-way disclosure of documents in advance; and

the  report  of  the  person  conducting  the  hearing  is  not  made  available  to  either  the

appellant or the CTP. As with applications referred to the Minister under s.18, there have

been criticisms of the selection and performance of persons appointed to conduct appeal

hearings.

The  current  Act  is  unclear  as  to  whether  it  provides  for  appeals  by  written

representations.  S.19(6) says that the Minister will appoint someone to conduct a hearing

if either the appellant or CTP wishes.  However, it gives no guidance on how the Minister

should proceed if neither of them expresses that desire.  It is presumed that the Minister

would  proceed  using  the  information  mentioned  in  the  1972  Regulations:    Para  9(2)

requires that any request for review of a decision by the CTP “shall be in writing and

58

shall state the precise grounds on which the request is based” and  Para 9(3) asks the CTP

to provide the file and a statement containing his/her observations on the request.  The

Minister would effectively determine the appeal on the basis of written representations.

This  position  is  unsatisfactory  and  probably  explains  to  a  large  extent  why  few  or  no

appeals are decided by written representations.  There may also be a feeling on the part

of applicants and appellants that with a planning system which is closed and opaque, the

Hearing  is  the  one  opportunity  to  have  their  say.    In  England  and  Wales  there  are

significant time savings with written representations and a large proportion of appeals

follow  this  route.    In  Bermuda,  where  applicants  can  attend  and  speak  at  the

Development Applications Board when their applications are first considered, the vast

majority of appeals are by written representations.  It is possible that in future there will

be more interest in using written representations in Barbados if it is quicker, less costly,

and  if  applicants  have  more  confidence  in  the  planning  system  generally.    It  is

recommended that the new Act includes provision for appeals by written representations

and that the Regulations are drafted accordingly.

These flaws in the existing appellate process expose the Minister to potential litigation.

Although s.19(8) of the Act provides that the decision of the Minister on appeals is final,

such decisions are susceptible to review by the High Count pursuant to s.72 of the Act,

on  the  limited  grounds  that  they  are  not  within  the  powers  of  the  Act,  and  on  all  the

grounds applicable to administrative decisions generally pursuant to the Administrative

Justice Act, CAP.109B, s.16(1)(b).

The objective of the appeal process should be to provide a system which is both efficient

and at the same time fair, impartial, transparent and independent with no party being at

a  disadvantage  and  with  the  rules  of  natural  justice  complied  with.    In  deciding  on  a

framework for the future it is necessary to consider two main elements – governance and

management.  Governance arrangements will be established by the new Act while the

management  issues  will  be  addressed  partly  by  Regulations  and  partly  by  improved

management practices and training.

In relation to appeals it is necessary to consider whether the Minister should be involved

in  making  the  final  decision.    It  is  arguable  that  all  matters  of  strategic  national

importance – and which should therefore be considered by the Minister – will have been

59

submitted  for  determination  by  the  Minister  through  the  referral  process  (see  section

4.B.8  above).  Another  factor  to  consider  must  be  the  extent  to  which  the  Minister’s

valuable time would be well spent considering minor appeals and where the Minister’s

involvement could contribute to further delay for the appellant.

Practice varies in other jurisdictions.  In Bermuda and Jamaica, like Barbados, the final

decision on all appeals (including written representations cases) is actually made by the

Minister.  In  Britain,  there  is  a  right  of  appeal  to  the  Minister  but  the  vast  majority  of

appeal decisions are made by the professional Planning Inspectorate, although there is a

provision for the Minister to “recover” an appeal and make the decision. In The Bahamas

and  other  Commonwealth  Caribbean  jurisdictions,  including  the  British  Overseas

Territories as well as the OECS member countries,  appeals are decided by an Appeals

Tribunal. Under the recent legislation in Trinidad & Tobago, appeals against planning

decisions  lie  to  the  same  special  court,  the  Environmental  Commission,  established  to

hear appeals under the environmental legislation.

Hence, as alternatives to the current arrangement, two governance options are suggested:

1.  Professional Inspectorate

This  is  the  approach  adopted  for  instance  in  the  UK  and  in  the  much  smaller

territory of Bermuda.  In the UK the Planning Inspectorate is an executive agency

of  Government  with  professional  inspectors  deciding  the  bulk  of  appeals

themselves  and  making  recommendations  to  the  Secretary  of  State  on  major

projects.  In Bermuda, an independent Inspector (currently one from Canada and

one from Barbados) visits the island periodically to conduct site visits and hearings

before making recommendations to the Minister.  This arrangement achieves the

objective of independence in a territory where the population is one quarter that

of Barbados.

2.  Planning Appeals Tribunal

This is the approach which has been adopted in the majority of Commonwealth

Caribbean  countries.  The  law  provides  for  the  Minister  to  appoint  suitably

qualified persons to be members of the Appeals Tribunal. In some cases, provision

is  made  for  a  larger  number  of  persons  to  be  appointed  to  a  panel  from  which

Appeals  Tribunals  are  appointed  on  a  case  by  case  basis,  to  avoid  potential

60

conflicts of interest and/or the Appeals Tribunal becoming overloaded or a centre

of  undue  influence.  The  persons  on  the  panel  should  all  be  qualified  and  have

relevant experience in planning, architecture, engineering, surveying, law or other

related land use or relevant profession.  Nominations could be put forward by the

relevant professional bodies for approval by the Minister.  After hearing a case or

considering written representations the Appeals Tribunal would issue its decision.

The Tribunal could also heard appeals from administrative decisions made under

legislation other than the planning law, that are related to land development.

In deciding between these options the issue of costs is relevant.  There is not the work

volume to justify a full-time Inspectorate but it would be possible to purchase time from

qualified consultants.  The Bermuda model of using Inspectors from overseas brings the

additional  costs  of  travel  and  accommodation.    Tribunal  members  would  also  need

remuneration and, whatever model is adopted, there will be servicing costs.  Whether a

professional Inspector or a Planning Tribunal is adopted, there must be strict provisions

with regard to conflicts of interest.

The recommended approach is that of an Appeals Tribunal.  Having three persons make

a  decision  reduces  both  the  possibility  of  corruption  and  the  suspicion  of  corruption,

especially  if  the  three  persons  are  selected  at  random  from  amongst  a  large  panel  of

qualified persons. The Tribunal’s decisions would be final on the planning merits of the

case and the only challenge through the courts would be on points of law.

### 5.  Cross-cutting Issues

#### A.  Public Participation

As acknowledged by the global community in Principle 10 of the 1992 Rio Declaration on

Environment  and  Development,  environmental  issues  are  best  handled  with  citizens’

participation, including the opportunity to participate in decision-making processes. This

was echoed, with specific reference to human settlements and shelter development, in

the 1996 Istanbul Declaration and Habitat Agenda, Chapter III.C and IV.D.3. Barbados

subscribed to both international instruments; however the existing planning legislation

does not reflect these principles.

61

The 2017 draft revision of the Physical Development Plan marked a major step forward

in public participation in the planning process in Barbados.  By introducing a stage of

participation on the draft plan before its formal submission the Minister, the CTP and the

consultancy team actually went further than is required by the existing law.  Early in the

plan preparation process there was a stakeholder event organized in conjunction with the

Barbados Town Planning Society, the draft document was made available for comment

on-line, and there were a number of town hall meetings at different locations.

Unfortunately,  this  level  of  involvement  does  not  apply  to  the  development  control

process.  In practice, the only requirement is to hold town hall meetings on completion of

an EIA.  Following the decision of the High Court in the case of Archer & Others v Chief

Town  Planner  &  Attorney  General,  No.1367  of  2008,  Judgment  of  Cornelius  J.,  18th

November 2014, it is now custom and practice to consult neighbours when there is an

application for a change of use in a residential neighbourhood.  In the absence of readily

available information on planning applications submitted, there is little opportunity for

third parties to comment on proposals that affect them individually or have an impact on

the public at large.  This situation is unsatisfactory.

It  is  recommended  that  the  following  improvements  should  be  introduced  and

incorporated in the new Act:

i.  The  good  practice  shown  in  preparation  of  the  2017  draft  revision  of  the  PDP

should be reaffirmed;

ii.  Applicants should be required to post a notice on site prior to the submission of a

planning application and certify that they have done so;

iii.  The CTP should publish on-line and by email to the press meaningful information

on all applications received;

iv.  Third  party  comments  should  be  regarded  as  being  capable  of  being  material

considerations in the evaluation of planning applications;

v.  Third party persons who have submitted comments or objections should have the

opportunity  to  submit  evidence  and  speak  briefly  at  Sustainable  Development

Board meetings;

vi.  Third party persons who  have previously submitted comments or  objections to

the  SDB  should  also  have  the  opportunity  to  appear  at  the  Planning  Appeals

Tribunal;

62

vii.  Third party persons who have submitted comments or objections should similarly

be able to appear at a Hearing convened to consider an application referred to the

Minister.

#### B.  Access to Information

Access  to  information  is  a  vital  element  of  building  confidence  in  the  town  planning

system and is a common thread which has run through a number of the sections above.

As recognized in Principle 10 of the Rio Declaration, there are direct links to the cross-

cutting issue of public participation - without information participation becomes difficult

and frustrating.  The public today expects access to information and modern technology

provides the means to achieve it.

In  the Physical  Development Planning  process  progress  has been  made  with the draft

revised PDP available on-line ahead of the consultation meetings last year.  In keeping

with  this,  evidence  that  forms  the  basis  for  future  review  of  the  PDP  and  monitoring

reports should be made available on-line also.  In this context, it is recognized that a large

element  of  the  data  that  forms  the  PDP  evidence  base  actually  comes  from  other

Government departments and agencies.  Sometimes there is an unwillingness to share

this data between (or even within) departments.  It is recognized that  the TCDPO has

been moving in the right direction on this issue and there is a need for other departments

and agencies to do likewise.

Turning to development control and other regulatory aspects of the system, the current

Act requires the CTP to keep a Register which takes the form of a paper document.  This

is available for consultation by members of the public who visit the TCDPO; however,

there is no deadline for making entries in the Register so the available information is often

incomplete and unreliable. Further, as recognized by the High Court and Court of Appeal

of  the  Eastern  Caribbean  Supreme  Court  in  the  recent  case  of  Anne  Hendricks  Bass  v

Director of Physical Planning, access to the brief notes in the planning register without

access  to  the  documents  and  plans  submitted  cannot  provide  adequate  information

concerning  planning  applications. In the context of 2018 and the Information Age this

does not constitute an acceptable level of access.

While recognizing that there are funding constraints on how much progress we can make

in the short term, it  is worth looking  at what can  be done to give the public access to
63

information  elsewhere.    In  England  and  Wales  the  Planning  Portal  is  a  joint  venture

established in 2002 between central government, local government and a private sector

service provider.  It is the route for submission of almost all planning and building control

applications and follows every application through the decision-making process.  It also

covers  appeals,  including  enforcement  appeals  and  applications  for  listed  building

consent.    The  information  available  to  the  public  is  extensive.    Full  details  of  every

application including drawings and  supporting  data such as design statements, traffic

studies  and  EIAs  can  be  accessed.    Responses  to  statutory  consultations,  third  party

comments and planning officers’ reports are available along with copies of all decisions

with  reasons.    For  appeals,  all  witness  statements,  proofs  of  evidence  and  inspectors’

reports are available.  The Planning Portal complies with UK freedom of information and

data  protection  legislation.    In  normal  circumstances  the  only  information  that  is  not

freely accessible is commercially confidential material and this is strictly defined.  In the

UK Council planning meetings are open to the public and minutes of these meetings are

published on-line.  Some Councils regularly stream their committee meetings.

While recognizing the cost of the UK approach and the fact that it would take a long time

to develop something similar, it is possible to introduce some changes at relatively little

or  no  cost.    For  instance,  the  CTP  should  publish  on-line  and  via  email  to  the  press  a

meaningful weekly list of applications received and decisions made.  As a minimum, this

list should show the date received, the application number, the applicant, the location of

the site and the nature of the development proposed.  For decisions it should also show

the date of the decision and whether permission was granted or refused.  The list should

also  include  decisions  on  applications  referred  to  the  Minister  and  appeals.    This  step

forward does not require new legislation and could be implemented in the short term

without prejudicing the full package of reform.

#### C.

Inter-Agency Consultations

Statutory consultations on planning applications are a major contribution to inefficiency

in the system.  The CTP complains that  agencies  do not meet their  deadlines and this

causes  delay  in  determining  applications  or  submitting  his  case  on  matters  that  are

referred  to  the  Minister  for  decision.    The  referral  agencies  complain  that  they  have

insufficient resources in terms of personnel or technology to handle these consultations

efficiently.

64

Section 17(2)(b) of the current Act says the Minister may require the CTP to consult with

the Town and Country Planning Advisory Committee and other authorities by way of an

order or directions.  Para 8 of the 1972 Development Order addresses this with detailed

requirements  to  consult  the  relevant  Minister  (or  such  person  as  the  Minister  may

appoint) on transport, traffic and drainage, on agricultural implications of development,

and the Water Board (now impliedly the Barbados Water Authority).  Para 8(3) gives the

Minister power to extend that direction to other statutory boards and persons.  Para (4)

directs the CTP to allow a period of not less than 14 days and not more than 21 days for

referral agancies to respond before he can make a decision.  Para (5) allows the CTP to

consult  other  boards,  persons  or  bodies  as  appropriate  including  the  Chief  Medical

Officer, statutory undertakers, the Port Manager, the Harbour Master and the Director of

Civil  Aviation.    The  detail  in  the  Development  Order  is  outdated  and  needs  revision.

There is also an anomaly in that it does not refer to the Director of the CZMU although

s.17(1C) of the Act is a 1998 amendment requiring the Minister to consult the Director of

Coastal Zone Management before granting or refusing planning permission under  s.15

which relates to Development Orders.

Defects  in  the  statutory  consultations  process  are  one  of  the  major  concerns  of

stakeholders.  It is considered that the process of transporting files from office to office is

outmoded.    Stakeholders  think  electronic  communications  (including  simple  e-mail

methods) should be used.  There is also criticism that some departments do not have the

technological  capacity  to  receive  plans  and  respond  by  electronic  means.    Also,  it  is

recognized  that  responding  to  planning  consultations  is  not  a  high  priority  in  some

operational departments.  There is a feeling amongst stakeholders that deadlines need to

be met but an understanding that personnel and skills shortages can prevent this.  This

is an area where there could be stakeholder support for “spend to save” measures that

would provide necessary technology and fill skills gaps.

It is recommended that -

  The Development Order should be updated as it relates to statutory consultations.
  There should be a specific requirement to consult the Director of the CZMU and

there  should  be  a  clearer  expectation  of  consultation  with  relevant  non-

governmental  bodies  on  applications  which  relate  to  their  areas  of  interest  and

expertise.

65

  Electronic  means  of  communication  should  become  the  norm  for  these

consultations.

  The TCPDO should have service level agreements with the major referral agencies.

Such agreements would make it clear at what point the  TCPDO would proceed

without a particular body’s input.

It  is  noted  that  there  could  be  an  improvement  in  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of

statutory  consultations  as  a  by-product  of  the  proposed  governance  arrangements.

Referral  agencies  will  be  represented  on  the  Sustainable  Development  Board  and  this

may itself give a higher priority to responding.  Also, people on the Board will be able to

give a “back-stop” response for their department or agency if an application comes to the

Board before a formal response has been received.

Another suggestion that came out of the stakeholder consultations was that there should

be  meetings  early  in  the  consideration  of  an  application  (possibly  before  submission)

involving the planners, relevant referral agencies and the applicant as a more regular part

of the process.  This would give everyone the opportunity to make their requirements

clear early on.  This idea relates to the broader question of how complex applications are

managed.  Simple time limits can be inappropriate to these applications and it is better to

adopt a project management approach involving the applicant and agree the tasks that

need to be completed and set a time line for achieving them.

This  leads  to  consideration  of  the  issue  of  having  a  “one  stop  shop”  for  planning

applications and related permits.  Stakeholder feeling was ambivalent:

i.

ii.
iii.

There  was  an  enthusiasm  for  the  idea  of  making  all  applications  to  one  point

(preferably by electronic means)

There was an enthusiasm for the idea of co-locating staff

There was a resistance to conflating all applications in one submission – basically

this reflects a design process where the principles are established (and planning

consent often obtained) before expensive detailed design work is undertaken)

iv.  There  was  criticism  that  some  agencies  were  using  the  development  control

system to introduce requirements that did not have planning relevance simply

because other regulatory systems were inadequate.

66

It is suggested that points i. and ii. are taken forward as the opportunity arises and that

points iii. and iv. are borne in mind.

It  is  necessary  to  make  specific  reference  to  building  standards  and  building  control.

While  these  issues  do  not  strictly  relate  to  inter-agency  consultation  on  planning

applications,  there  was  considerable  discussion  relating  to  them  at  the  stakeholder

events.  Nobody suggested that an island like Barbados in the Caribbean hurricane belt

does not need an appropriate set of building standards.  There was considerable debate

about  the  way  these  should  be  delivered.    There  was  criticism  of  the  currently  un-

proclaimed legislation as representing an expensive public sector model that the country

could not afford.  There was strong support from the private sector professionals in the

stakeholder events for a system of self-certification of plans by qualified and registered

professionals (backed by insurance) and inspection by independent professionals.  While

not  within  the  remit  of  this  paper,  it  is  noted  that  new  legislation  will  be  needed  on

building standards to achieve an effective and affordable solution.

#### D.  Certification of Compliance

Section  21  of  the  Act  indicates  that  where  a  person  who  proposes  to  carry  out  any

operation on land or make any changes in the use of land wishes to have it determined

whether  the  proposal  constitutes  development  and,  if  it  does,  whether  a  planning

application  is  required,  he  may  apply  to  the  CTP  for  a  determination.    Any  person

dissatisfied in point of law may appeal to a judge. It is reported that financial institutions

in Barbados require borrowers to produce certification that works constitute permitted

development prior to granting loans for such works. Presumably this is being done under

this section.

There  are  no  provisions  in  the  Act  relative  to  issuing  certificates  of  compliance  per  se;

however,  certificates  issued  by  the  CTP  are  required  under  other  statutes  (e.g:  under

Public Entertainment Act, CAP.85A, s.4(1)(a); and the Special Development Areas Act,

CAP.237A  s.5).  Moreover,  it  has  become  an  established  practice  in  Barbados  for  legal

practitioners  to  apply  to  the  CTP  for  certificates  of  compliance  as  part  of  the  search

process to verify that the title to property to be conveyed to purchasers is good. This is

necessitated  in  part  because  the  TCPDO  does  not  maintain  a  register  of  enforcement

proceedings.

67

The England and Wales legislation (Town and Country Planning Act 1990: Section 191 as

amended  by  section  10  of  the  Planning  and  Compensation  Act  1991  and  the  Town  and

Country Planning (General Development Procedure) Order (England) 2015) has similar

provisions  for  the  issuing  of  a  Lawful  Development  Certificate.  A  Lawful  Development

Certificate  is  a  legal  document  stating  the  lawfulness  of  past,  present  or  future  building  use,

operations, or other matters. If granted by the local planning authority, the certificate means that

enforcement  action  cannot  be  carried  out  with  respect  to  the  development  referred  to  in  the

certificate.

The certificate is not a planning permission. The planning merits of the use, operation or

activity in the application are not relevant. The issue of a certificate depends entirely on

factual evidence about the history and planning status of the building or other land and

the interpretation of any relevant planning law or judicial authority. The responsibility is

on the applicant to provide evidence to support the application.

An application for a Lawful Development Certificate form should be used to establish

whether:

  an existing use of land, or some operational development, or some activity in

#### breach of a planning condition, is lawful

  a proposed use of buildings or other land, or some operations proposed to be

carried out in, on, over, or under land, would be lawful

Examples when an application for a Lawful Development Certificate should be made
include:

o  when planning enforcement action is taken by the local planning authority and

the  owner  believes  it  is  immune  from  action  because  the  time  limit  for  taking

enforcement action has passed

#### o  when  an  owner  discovers,  in  the  course  of  a  sale  of  the  land,  that  planning

permission has never been granted, and needs to show a prospective purchaser

that no enforcement action can be taken by the local planning authority

A certificate granted for a proposed, or an existing use, operation or activity will specify

(by reference to a plan or drawing) the area of land included in the certificate and describe

the precise  nature  of the use, operation or activity which  is lawful. The certificate will

68

give the reason for determining the use or operation to be lawful and specify the date of

the application for the certificate.

In UK legislation it is an offence to provide false or misleading information or to withhold

material  information  with intent to deceive.  The council to can revoke, at any time, a

certificate they may have issued as a result of such false or misleading information.

Recommendation -

#### o  That the existing legislation and procedures relating to Certificates of Compliance

be reviewed and brought up to date.

#### E.  Use of Technology

The increased use of technology in the planning system could significantly advance inter-

agency consultations, decision making time-frames, transparency and modernization of

planning  practice

in  Barbados.  Recent  stakeholder  consultations  and  other

representations by professional bodies have pointed to a number of concerns that centre

on out-dated management systems in planning practice.  Those challenges and concerns

include the manual circulation of files for consultation within the TCDPO and between

the  TCDPO  and  other  consulting  agencies,  the  limited  or  incomplete  land  registration

system as a basis for forward planning to facilitate development and investment, poor

public access  to  information on proposed developments,  limited on-line information on

the number and types of development applications being received by the TCDPO and

the limited use of google earth images to manage unauthorised developments, among

others matters.

It is expected that a shift to a more digital system of planning  would facilitate a more

transparent  planning  system  through  greater  public  involvement  and  participation.

Additionally, greater incorporation of technology into the planning process, specifically

development  control  and  enforcement,  can  lead  to  a  more  efficient  planning  system.

Incorporation  of  technology  can  facilitate  timelier  completion  of  tasks  (e.g.  review  of

applications)  while  reducing  the  need  for  repetitive  tasks  which  may  lead  to  more

manageable workloads for planning officials and increase productivity.

In  particular,  stakeholders  have  emphasised  the  need  for  a  dynamic  process  for  the

monitoring  of  changes  to  the  development  plan  facilitated  by  an  updated  digital

69

information  sharing  platform.  This  might  involve  an  easily  accessible  digital  forum

where the public can not only view proposed changes to development plans but share

their views and comments on such amendments on a digital platform. Recently, the Draft

PDP  2017  was  uploaded  to  a  website  and  the  public  was  able  to  offer  feedback  and

comments of the proposed revisions to the PDP. It has been proposed that this process be

taken further and once the development plan is approved by the Government the pattern

of development decisions could be viewed by the public on an on-going basis.

There  has  also  been  also  a  suggestion  for  the  use  of  digital  evidence  in  legal  cases

concerning planning enforcement. An example used was Google Earth, which provides

satellite  imagery  at  a  relatively  high  spatial  resolution.  As  such  it  could  employed  to

delineate  for  example  breaches  into  areas  where  development  is  not  permitted  (e.g.

coastal  setbacks,  ecologically  sensitive  areas,  and  heritage  sites).  Conversely  it  could

prove useful in the settling of disputes concerning land encroachment. The main benefit

is that evidence of this form can be provided in-situ during a court session and could be

referred to in an attempt to settle relevant disputes.

There have been strong calls from stakeholders for a shift to an electronic / web-based

system  for  the  submission  and  review  of  development  applications.  Specifically,

stakeholders  stated  that  an  electronic  planning  application  process  would  be  more

efficient and would ultimately facilitate a more timely decision. Additional components

of  such  a  system  include:  a)  a  publicly  accessible  GIS  database  of  areas  where

development  is  not  permitted,  b)  electronic  submission  of  planning  applications,  c)

digitization  of  planning  applications  and  fully  digital  process  for  circulation  of

applications to agencies involved in approval of planning applications (e.g. applications

database / emails), d)  an online system  for public tracking  progress of applications, e)

posting notices of applications on-line

A number of countries have incorporated some of the changes requested by stakeholders

into  their  planning  systems.  One  such  country  is  Singapore,  which  has  made  fully

accessible to the public the present main development plan (Master Plan), as well as past

versions of that particular plan. The plan is in the format of an interactive map which

shows the various land uses within the nation.

70

Figure 3: Singapore’s Master Plan (sourced from Urban Redevelopment Authority 2018)

Any member of the public is able to view the permitted land uses and zones in any part

of the country and toggle off or on various layers (e.g. footpaths, cycling paths, overhead

passes etc). Secondly, Singapore has an online database of proposed amendments to their

Master Plan as well as approved amendments. Amendments in their case mainly refers

to proposed changes of land uses from their permitted use as outlined in the Master Plan.

The details of such amendments are also available for public inspection. This facilitates

the  public  consultation  process  required  in  Singapore,  before  any  amendment  to  the

Master Plan is made.

Development  plans  for  local  areas  and  some  neighbourhoods  in  England  are  easily

accessible  online.  There  exists  a  database,  accessible  to  the  public,  of  all  local  plans

submitted  in  the  country,  their  status  (how  far  they  have  progressed  in  the  approval

process).  This  information  is  provided  in  spreadsheet  format  which  facilitates  data

analysis.  Additionally,  all  planning  applications  (updated  weekly)  and  their  status

(approved, denied, etc) is accessible on the internet through the Planning Portal for all

local areas within England. The public is also able to comment on or object to proposed

developments  digitally,  using  the  same  portal.  Detail  information  on  the  progress  of

planning appeals is also available.

There is the potential institutional capacity for the incorporation of digital information

into each aspect of Barbados’ planning system. The Lands and Survey Department has  a

wealth of geospatial data and is a repository of all certified survey plans. This department
71

has  the  largest  group  of  trained  geomatic  engineers  in  the  Government  Service.

Additionally, the Town and Country Planning Department has invested heavily in GIS

(Geographical  Information  Systems),  training  and  equipment  over  the  years,  and

understands  the  significance  of  GIS  in  the  analysis  of  planning  options  and  scenarios.

Perhaps  a  jointly  operated  national  geospatial  agency  or  repository  of  geospatial  data

(between  the  aforementioned  and  other  relevant  agencies)  can  be  established  so  as  to

assist  in  the  preparation  of  development  plans  which  can  be  easily  and  continually

monitored for changes and updated as necessary and are easily accessible to the public.

Public  participation  and  transparency  can  be  facilitated  in  Barbados’  planning  system

through  the  provision  of  digital  information  on  planning  applications  and  planning

trends.  Also,  provisions  should  be  made  to  strongly  encourage  or  mandate  the  use  of

digital information and electronic devices in the circulation of planning documentation

between relevant agencies. This would most likely greatly improve the timeliness of the

development planning application process and lead to a more efficient system.

### 6.     Implementation

Introducing the legislation

The reforms to the town planning system recommended in this paper will require major

changes to both primary and subordinate legislation.  It is proposed that Barbados will

have a new Town and Country Planning Act.  This will be drafted by October and should

pass through both Houses of Parliament by 30 November.  The Act can then receive the

Royal  Assent  but  should  not  be  proclaimed  until  all  the  subordinate  legislation  and

administrative changes are in place.

After the Act has been drafted work can start on the subordinate legislation.  This will

include  the  new  General  Development  Order,  a  Use  Classes  Order,  and  Regulations

covering amongst other things the operations of the Sustainable Development Board and

the Planning Appeals Tribunal.  By its nature this subordinate legislation is technical and

detailed.  It is suggested that its preparation would be assisted by targeted consultation

on specific aspects with appropriate professionals in the public and private sectors as well

as with staff in the TCDPO and the Ministry.  It is also suggested that the target date for

completion of drafting the subordinate legislation should be the end of March 2019.

72

Organisational Change

This paper recommends significant changes to governance with the establishment of a

Sustainable Development Board and a Planning Appeals Tribunal.  This change involves

new  roles  and  responsibilities  for  the  people  involved  in  each  body.    It  also  involves

changed  roles  and  working  practices  for  staff  in  both  the  TCDPO  and  the  Minister’s

Office.    To  facilitate  all  these  changes  it  is  recommended  that  early  provisional

appointments  are  made  to  the  Sustainable  Development  Board  and  to  the  Planning

Appeals Tribunal.  This should be done in March 2019 and both bodies should effectively

function in “shadow” form to undergo training before the Act is proclaimed and the new

system goes live.

Taking  into  account  the  legislative  processes  and  the  need  to  put  the  organisational

changes  in  place,  it  is  proposed  that  the  new  Act  should  be  proclaimed  and  become

effective  in  June  2019  and  the  Sustainable  Development  Board  and  Planning  Appeals

Tribunal should take on their duties at that point.

Managing the change process

At  a  number  of  points  in  this  Green  Paper  it  is  stated  that  changes  are  needed  in

management culture and leadership.  It is also important that processes introduced or

amended by the new Act are managed in a pro-active rather than reactive manner.  While

introducing new legislation is fundamentally important, we will not be fully successful

in achieving our goals for reform without making these management changes.

Making  any  change  in  a  bureaucratic  system  requires  clear  and  committed  leadership

from the senior people involved. New skills will be needed in managing the processing

of planning applications, referrals to the Minister and appeals.  This will include setting

and meeting targets and progress chasing.  This is a totally different approach from the

current “file-driven” methods.  Staff will need training in new skills.

Similarly, the existence of a Sustainable Development Board and the use of a Planning

Appeals  Tribunal  will  require  different  skills  in  servicing  meetings  and  actioning

decisions. As mentioned above, the members of the Sustainable Development Board and

the Planning Appeals Tribunal will need training in their roles, responsibilities and in the

nature of the processes that they are involved in.

73

All  this  needs  to  be  in  place,  along  with  all  the  subsidiary  legislation,  before  the  new

system can go live.  It is recommended that a project management approach is adopted

to managing this programme of change.

Items for early implementation

Not all the changes recommended in this Green Paper require legislation, organisational

change  or  significant  expenditure.    There  are  actions  that  could  be  implemented

immediately at relatively or no cost and which would not prejudice implementation of

wider reform and the new legislation.

The following items are put forward for consideration:

i.  The  Chief  Town  Planner  should  publish  on-line  and  via  email  to  the  press  a

meaningful  weekly  list  of  applications  received  and  decisions  made  (including

decisions by the Minister).

ii.  Hearings on appeals and matters referred to the Minister should be held in public.
iii.  Voluntary disclosure of evidence in advance should be requested from all parties

taking part in S18 and S19 Hearings.

Panellists should be advised to adopt a consistent approach to Hearings and site

visits.

Panellists’ reports should be copied to the applicant or appellant and to the Chief

Town Planner.

In all cases the Minister’s decision should be published with a justification.
