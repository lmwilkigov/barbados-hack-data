OBJECTS AND REASONS

This Bill would repeal and replace the Family Law (Amendment) Act, 2013,

of the Family Law Council, to make provision for the following:

(c)

(d)

(e)

(f)

(g)

to enable the courts, when determining maintenance issues, to take into
account  relevant  internationally  accepted  principles  and  relevant
findings of published research;

to authorise the courts to order the transfer or settlement of property
for the maintenance of a child;

to provide that claims, other than claims relating to maintenance, in
proceedings affecting the property of parties to a marriage or a union
other than a marriage do not abate if one of those parties dies while the
proceedings are pending;

to  make  clear  that  rules  may  be  made  for  the  enforcement  of
maintenance payments, whether or not the payments in question are in
arrears;

to empower the courts to delay the grant of a divorce until property
matters have been settled;

to redefine the period during which the parties to a union other than a
marriage are required to have continuously co-habited; and

to expand the enforcement jurisdiction of the courts to include power
to order arrest and imprisonment in proper cases.
