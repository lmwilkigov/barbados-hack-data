Electoral  and  Boundaries  Commission,  hereafter
the
Commission, in respect of an election and also to provide for
the Commission to discharge the duties or functions granted
under any enactment. This will, among other things, provide

the  functions  granted  under  the  National  Registration  Act,
2015-  .
