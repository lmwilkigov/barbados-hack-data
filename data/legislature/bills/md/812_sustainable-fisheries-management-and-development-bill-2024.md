transfers any quantity of fish onboard to another vessel;

“fish” means all species of living marine resources that have not been previously

landed, whether processed or not;

“fishing related activities”

means any operation in support of, or in preparation for, fishing; and

includes

(i)

the landing, packaging, processing, transshipping or transporting
of fish that has not been previously landed at a port; and

(ii)

the provisioning of personnel, fuel, gear and other supplies at sea;

(a)

(b)

“landing”

Guidelines to prevent IUU fishing from fish transshipment activities

324.(1)
provide guidelines to prevent IUU fishing from fish transshipment activities

The Minister shall, after consultation with the Chief Fisheries Officer,

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

to ensure conformity with the relevant rules of international law;

to ensure that all movement of fish as transshipped and other related
activities are properly documented;

to ensure that donor and receiving vessels are appropriately authorized
to engage in transshipment operations;

to include transparent reporting procedures to facilitate pre-event and
post-event verification of authorization and transshipment data;

to ensure a risk based approach so that measures are prioritized and
proportional  with  identified  risks,  and  are  designed  to  reduce  and
mitigate those risks effectively;

(f)

to require electronic reporting and encourage electronic monitoring,
where feasible; and

241

(g)

to  ensure  that  transshipment  events  are  adequately  regulated,
authorized,  monitored  and  complemented  by  port  State  and  coastal
State measures or flagged State actions to landing of transshipped fish,
and support traceability, where possible.

(2)

Subsection (1) does not apply to aquaculture products.

Authorization of transshipment of fish

325.(1)
landed, whether processed or not shall obtain a fish transshipment licence.

A person who wishes to transship fish which have not been previously

(2)

A fish transshipment licence may be granted in the following categories:

(a)

(b)

donor fish transshipment licence, for donor vessels; or

receiving fish transshipment licence, for receiving vessels.

A person who wishes to obtain a fish transhipment licence may apply to

(3)
the Chief Fisheries Officer in such form as he approves.

No Barbados registered fishing vessel may act as both donor and receiving
(4)
vessel for any given period beginning with a port exit and ending with the next
port entry.

Where the owner of a Barbados registered fishing vessel wishes to switch
(5)
to donor vessel, if presently acting as receiving vessel, or switch to receiving
vessel, if presently acting as donor vessel, that owner shall apply to the Chief
Fisheries Officer to have his donor fish transshipment licence or receiving fish
transshipment licence, as the case may be, revoked, and after such revocation
apply for the licence desired.

Nothing  in  this  Part  prevents  a  donor  and  receiving  vessel  from

(6)
transshipping in cases of force majeure or distress.

The donor and receiving vessel shall report the transshipment activities
(7)
using the declaration containing information on vessels, catches and activities
including relevant elements specified in the fishing industry notice.

242

A Barbados registered vessel shall only engage in transshipment if it has

(8)
an approved functioning vessel monitoring system onboard.

(9)
The Chief Fisheries Officer shall ensure that donor and receiving vessels
are  included  in  all  vessel  authorization  records  of  relevant  RFMO  and  where
applicable, the Global Record of Fishing Vessels, Refrigerated Transport Vessels
and Supply Vessels.

Only donor and receiving vessels entitled to fly the flag of a contracting
(10)
party  or  a  cooperating  non-contracting  party  of  a  specific  RFMO  may  be
authorized to conduct transshipment activities with Barbados registered vessels
subject to the regulatory competence of that RFMO.

The authorization records of donor and receiving vessels shall comply with

(11)
the rules established by that RFMO.

No  transshipment  of  fish  shall  be  carried  out  by  a  Barbados  registered
(12)
vessel in areas beyond the national jurisdiction of Barbados, except the vessel
owner or operator holds

(a)

a  donor  fish  transshipment  licence  or  receiving  fish  transshipment
licence, as the case may be;

(b)

an Area Beyond National Jurisdiction Fish Transshipment Permit; and

(c)

written authorization from the relevant coastal State or port State, if
the transshipment is to take place in waters or in a port of a State other
than Barbados.

The  Chief  Fisheries  Officer  shall  ensure  that  transshipment  activities
(13)
subject to the regulatory competence of an RFMO are only authorized where both
the donor and receiving vessels have been included in the relevant authorized
vessel lists by their respective flag States.

Transshipment is prohibited if any of the vessels involved is included in

(14)
IUU fishing vessel lists established by relevant RFMO.

243

(15)
The Chief Fisheries Officer shall ensure that all donor and receiving vessels
eligible to receive an IMO number shall be required to have such number in order
to be authorized by the flag State regardless of the location of the event.

The  IMO  number  referred  to  in  subsection  (15)  shall  be  made  readily

(16)
available to all relevant States and relevant international organizations.

The Chief Fisheries Officer shall, in consultation with stakeholders, adopt

(17)
measures to control transshipment of fish.

Measures controlling transshipment of fish shall be implemented to include
(18)
specific criteria for the receipt of authorizations by vessels to transship, including

(a)

(b)

the conditions under which a flag State authorizes Barbados registered
vessels to transship;

the  conditions  under  which  a  coastal  State  or  port  State  authorizes
vessels to transship in areas under its national jurisdiction;

(c)

the MCS measures that must be in place for fish transshipment to occur;

(d)

data collection and reporting requirements; and

(e)

ensuring  that  transshipment  is  conducted  consistent  with  the
management regime of the relevant RFMO and the flag State, relevant
coastal State and port State.

The  Chief  Fisheries  Officer  may  only  authorize  Barbados  registered
(19)
vessels  to  be  involved  in  transshipment  of  fish  when  its  competent  MCS
authorities have the capacity to monitor and control the transshipment, including
by applying risk assessments separately for fish transshipments in port and at sea.

Where fish is to be landed or transshipped in a port, Barbados registered
(20)
vessels shall use designated ports of States that are acting in accordance with or
in a manner consistent with the Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent,
Deter or Eliminate Illegal Unreported and Unregulated Fishing.

244

Standard notification and reporting

326.(1)
An owner or operator of a Barbados registered vessel shall report to
the  Chief  Fisheries  Officer,  in  an  agreed  format,  information  relating  to  fish
transshipment events involving Barbados registered vessels such as notifications
and authorizations, transshipment and landing declarations and observer reports.

An  owner  or  operator  of  a  Barbados  registered  vessel  shall  streamline
(2)
notification and reporting requirements in a manner that does not undermine the
effectiveness of measures indicated in this Part.

Pre-event notification and verification

The Chief Fisheries Officer shall ensure that all Barbados registered
327.(1)
vessels intending to carry out fish transshipments, as either a donor or receiving
vessel, provide

(a)

(b)

advance  notifications  of  the  intent  to  proceed  with  a  specific
transshipment event to the Chief Fisheries Officer; and

the  relevant  RFMO  as  soon  as  possible,  and  on  a  timeline  that  will
support effective MCS.

The  donor  vessel  shall  report  quantities  of  fish  onboard  prior  to  the
(2)
transshipment event, as well as quantities to be transshipped, including regulated
and unregulated species, and any by catch.

The receiving vessel shall report the quantities of fish onboard prior to the
(3)
transshipment event, including regulated and unregulated species, and any by
catch  and  the  quantities  of  transshipped  fish  shall  be  reported  by  species  and
product form and catch area.

The  advance  notification  from  donor  and  receiving  vessels  shall  also

(4)
include the date, time and location of the planned transshipment event.

Upon receipt of an advance notification of fish transshipment from a donor
(5)
vessel  and  prior  to  acknowledging  and  confirming  that  the  operation  could

245

proceed,  the  Chief  Fisheries  Officer  shall  verify  the  vessel's  compliance  with
relevant conservation and management measures and MCS measures, including
near real-time VMS reporting, and other applicable electronic monitoring and
observer coverage requirements.

The Chief Fisheries Officer shall ensure that Barbados registered donor
(6)
vessels provide regular reporting about fishing since its last port exit, including
catch and effort data for the specific transshipment event to proceed.

All donor and receiving vessels intending to conduct fish transshipment
(7)
subject  to  the  regulatory  competence  of  an  RFMO  shall  notify  that  particular
RFMO when they enter and exit the RFMO area of competence based on the
respective RFMO measures.

Nothing in this section supersedes Port State responsibility in instances

(8)
where fish transshipment is carried out in port.

Post-event reporting

328.(1)

All donor and receiving vessels involved in transshipment of fish shall

(a)

(b)

log the event with the Chief Fisheries Officer; and

provide  a  transshipment  declaration,  containing  information  on
vessels,  catches  and  activities  in  the  forms  as  set  out  in  the  Fourth
Schedule,

which shall be submitted to all relevant competent authorities and the relevant
RFMO, as soon as possible and on a timeline that will support effective MCS,
and before any landing or subsequent transshipment is authorized.

Barbados registered vessels shall maintain onboard records that include
(2)
each transshipment declaration and a copy of the declaration shall accompany
the transshipped fish on the receiving vessel.

Where transshipment of fish is independently monitored by an observer,
(3)
the  observer  shall  provide  a  report  for  all  transshipment  events,  regardless  of

246

location of the event to the port or to the Barbados Coast Guard and the relevant
RFMO as soon as possible and on a timeline that will support effective MCS.

Observer  reports  in  respect  of  Barbados  registered  vessels  shall  be

(4)
examined by the Chief Fisheries Officer.

Where  the  observer  reports  discrepancies  on  the  data  reported  by  the
(5)
masters  of  the  donor  and  receiving  vessels  or  possible  non-compliance  with
applicable  rules,  the  Chief  Fisheries  officer  shall  take  the  appropriate  control
measures.

The owner or operator of the donor vessel and the receiving vessel shall,

(6)
as part of the transshipment declaration, report the

(a)

(b)

quantities of fish transshipped as well as the quantities of fish onboard
following the transshipment using information on vessels;

catches  and  activities,  including  relevant  elements  specified  in  the
fishing industry notice;

(c)

quantities of fish reported by species, product form and catch area; and

(d)

the date, time and location of the transshipment.

Information on landings and transshipments of fish harvested subject to
(7)
the regulatory competence of a relevant RFMO shall be reported to that specific
RFMO in accordance with its rules.

The pre-notification and post event reporting procedures for transshipment

(8)
shall be in an electronic form where practicable.

detained under this Act and a charge is laid against the master, owner or charterer
of the vessel in respect of the offence for which the vessel has been detained, the
master, owner, charterer or agent of the owner or of the charterer of the vessel
may at any time before the determination of the charge apply to the court by
which  the  charge  is  due  to  be  determined  for  the  release  of  the  vessel  on  the
provision of security in accordance with this Act.

On hearing the application the court, on ensuring that no evidence that may

(2)
be required is thereby prejudiced, shall either

(a)

(b)

on  being  satisfied  that  reasonable  security  has  been  paid  to  the
Government in respect of the aggregate of the maximum fine to which
the offender may be liable, order the release of the fishing vessel; or

order the release of the fishing vessel on the production, by any person
or persons, so authorized by the court, of a reasonable bond in favour
of the Government in the specified form, and in an amount not less than
the aggregate of the maximum fine to which the offender may be liable.

Notwithstanding subsection (2), the court may, where it is satisfied that
(3)
there are special circumstances to justify it doing so, order that the bond be in a
specified amount that is not less than the minimum fine to which the offender
may be liable.

285

(4)

The conditions of the bond shall be that, if

(a)

(b)

the offender is found not guilty of the offence; or

the offender, on being convicted of the offence, pays in full within 14
days after he is convicted the amount of the fine imposed by the court,

then the bond shall be of no effect but that otherwise the bond shall remain in full
force and effect.

The amount specified in the bond shall be recoverable in full in any court
(5)
of competent jurisdiction as a debt due to the State jointly or severally by the
person by whom the bond is given unless the person proves due performance of
the condition for which the bond was made.

For the purposes of this section, "fishing vessel" includes all equipment
(6)
onboard or used by the vessel and also includes all fish that has been seized from

may be necessary is preserved, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Act,

(a)

(b)

return the fish or other thing to the person from whom it was seized on
receiving the security that in the Chief Fisheries Officer's opinion is
adequate for the equivalent value of the fish or the thing by way of
bond or other stipulation conditioned for payment of such equivalent
value in the event that such amount shall be adjudged by the court to
be forfeited to the State; or

cause the sale by public auction of the fish or other thing and if court
proceedings are instituted deposit the proceeds of sale in court pending
an order by the court in respect of the forfeiture or otherwise of the
proceeds or release the proceeds to the person from whom the fish or
thing was seized in accordance with section 352.
