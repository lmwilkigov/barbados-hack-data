ROAD TRAFFIC (AMENDMENT) ACT, 2017

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

The Road Traffic Act came into force on 1st June, 1981 to establish, inter
alia, the duties of owners and drivers of motor vehicles and the standards that
should be observed by road users. Following the last amendment to the Act in
2009,  a  number  of  changes  have  become  necessary.  Such  changes  include
technological  and  social  advancements  such  as  breathalyser  testing  and
designated parking areas for persons with disabilities respectively. It has also
become necessary to provide for the regulation of all terrain vehicles, given the
recent increase in the use of those vehicles on the public roads.

Clause 1:

Clause 2:

Clause 3:

Clause 4:

This clause provides the short title of the amending Act. It may
be cited as the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act, 2017.

This  clause  amends  the  interpretation  section  of  the  Road
Traffic Act, Cap. 295 (the Act), to delete and substitute the
terms  “all  terrain  vehicles”,  ”driver”,  owner”,  “trailer”  and
“vehicle”. The clause also amends the interpretation section
of the Act to define the terms “carriageway”, “construction
zone”, “disabled parking permit”, “drive”, “driving licence”,
“garage”,  “highway”,  “learner’s  permit”,  “median  strip”,
“parking” and “registration number plates”.

This clause amends section 10 of the Act to make reference
to the newly inserted section 10E.

This clause amends the Act by inserting sections 10E and 10F.
It provides that manufacturers of registration number plates
must  be  registered  with  the  Licensing  Authority  and  what
steps must be taken to become registered. It imposes a duty
upon  persons  to  obtain  registration  number  plates  from
registered manufacturers only. It also sets out the duty of a

i

Road Traffic (Amendment) Act, 2017

manufacturer  to  ensure  that  he  is  presented  with  certain
documents prior to issuing a registration number plate. It also
provides the penalty for manufacturing registration number
plates without being registered, obtaining registration number
plates from a manufacturer who is not registered and issuing
number  plates  without  sight  of  the  relevant  documents.
Provision is also made for the transitional period within which
a  manufacturer  of  number  plates  must  register  with  the
Licensing Authority as well as the transitional period within
which a person may obtain number plates from a manufacturer
who is not registered.

This  clause  amends  section  42  of  the  Act  to  provide  that  a
driver who is unable to produce an insurance certificate when
required  to  do  so,  must  produce  the  certificate  at  a  police
station  designated  by  the  member  of  the  Police  Force  who
requested the certificate.

This  clause  amends  the  Act  by  inserting  sections  43A  and
43B. Provision is made for the circumstances under which a
vehicle  becomes  written-off  and  a  duty  is  imposed  on
insurance  companies  to  register  certain  particulars  of  the
written-off vehicle with the Licensing Authority. The clause
also  provides  the  penalty  for  failing  to  comply  with  the
registration requirements. It also imposes a duty on insurance
companies to submit the name and address of a purchaser of
a written-off vehicle within 14 days of the date of purchase.

This clause amends the Act by inserting Part IVA which deals
with all terrain vehicles. The Part comprises sections 60B to
60I. These sections prohibit drivers from driving all terrain
vehicles on public roads or highways unless they hold a valid
driving  licence  and  obtained  special  permission  from  the
Licensing Authority. Section 60D imposes a requirement that

ii

Clause 5:

Clause 6:

Clause 7:

Clause 8:

Clause 9:

Clause 10:

Clause 11:

Road Traffic (Amendment) Act, 2017

all  terrain  vehicles  be  registered  and  insured.  General
prohibitions  on  the  operation  of  all  terrain  vehicles  are
imposed by section 60E and section 60F lists the rules that
must be observed by drivers of all terrain vehicles. Sections
60G,  60H  and  60I  respectively,  make  provision  for  the
protective  equipment  to  be  worn  when  travelling  on  an  all
terrain vehicle, the duty of persons who rent all terrain vehicles
to keep certain records and the penalty for failing to comply
with Part IVA.

This clause amends section 61 of the Act to make reference
in subsection (1) to a valid driving licence, where that section
previously referred to a driving licence.

This clause amends section 69 of the Act to increase the age
from  which  a  driving  licence  for  certain  vehicles  may  be
issued and to specify the age from which a driving licence for
a self-driven or hired car may be granted.

This clause amends the Act to insert section 69A which makes
provision for random alcohol and drug tests to be carried out
on persons who drive articulated vehicles and persons who
drive public service vehicles.

This clause amends the Act by repealing and replacing section
74. The section imposes a requirement upon drivers of motor
vehicles  on  public  roads  to  have  a  driving  licence  or  an
identification card for presentation to a member of the Police
Force or a transport inspector, if required to do so. The section
also makes provision for the procedure to followed when a
driver is unable to produce his driving licence and the penalty
for failing to comply with a requirement to produce a driving
licence or an identification card.

iii

Clause 12:

Clause 13:

Clause 14:

Clause 15:

Road Traffic (Amendment) Act, 2017

This clause amends the Act by inserting section 76A which
makes provision for the action to be taken by the Licensing
Authority where a payment made by cheque in respect of a
permit, licence or registration is dishonoured. It also provides
that no person who has monies outstanding to the Barbados
Revenue Authority will be able to renew a permit or driving
licence or register a motor vehicle.

This clause amends the Act by inserting section 84A which
imposes a prohibition on driving at a speed that is greater than
the  speed  limit  in  a  construction  zone  and  provides  the
penalties for persons who contravene the prohibition.

This clause amends the Act by repealing and replacing section
85 and provides for the offence of driving, attempting to drive
or being in charge of a motor vehicle while under the influence
of drink or a drug, or having consumed alcohol in excess of
the prescribed limit. Provision is also made for more severe
penalties  for  persons  who  are  guilty  of  offences  under  the
section.

This clause amends the Act by inserting sections 85A to 85I
which  pertain  to  breathalyser  testing  and  related  matters.
Provision is made for the approval of the relevant breathalyser
equipment  by  the  Minister,  the  circumstances  under  which
persons may be required to provide a specimen of breath and
the procedure to be followed when a requirement to provide
a specimen of breath is made. In addition, provision is made
for the circumstances under which persons may be required
to provide specimens of blood or urine and the procedure to
be  followed  when  persons  are  required  to  provide  such
specimens. Provision is also made for the power of members
of the Police Force to make an arrest, without a warrant, in
specified  circumstances  and  protection  of  hospital  patients

from  being  arrested  and  from  being  required  to  provide  a
specimen,  in  the  absence  of  approval  from  the  medical
practitioner in charge of their cases.
