 Executive Summary

Barbados has amongst the lowest population growth rates in CARICOM. The total population has
grown by just 16.5% in the last 60 years. Since 1960, birth and fertility rates have consistently
fallen, and fertility rates have remained below replacement since 1980. Offsetting this decline has
been  only  a  modest  rise  in  immigration  levels  alongside  a  decline  in  outward  migration  of
Barbadians.  This  combination  of  factors  has  resulted  an  aging  population  structure.  Based  on
birth,  death  and  migration  rates,  actual  population  decline  was  expected  to  be  evident  in  the
2030s.

However, inconsistent with these projections, the 2021 Population Census estimates show for the
first time since 1960, an actual population decline.  There are approximately 10,000 fewer persons
residing in Barbados in 2021 than there was in 2010.

An  aging  population,  without  any  intervention  will  result  in  consequential  decreases  in  the
workforce, increases in the care responsibility by a minority for the majority of the population;
declines  in  government  revenues  as  the  employment  related  tax-base  contracts  and  a  likely
decline in economic, social and cultural dynamism.

Over the next 30 years, the dependency ratio will grow to nearly two dependents per person of
working-age, placing strains on families and social care and security systems. Care of the elderly
is expected to nearly double in its demand of financing from just under 20 percent of total health
expenditure  to  nearly  40  percent.  The  social  and  economic  costs  of  an  ageing  society  with  a
preponderance of retired persons are broad, complex and conditional on responses.

The  current  population  structure  is  the  unintended  result  of  improvements  in  socio-economic
conditions and the realization of human rights. With greater access to quality education, labour
force  opportunities  and  health  care,  including  sexual  and  reproductive  services,  Barbados  has
seen a steady decline in birth and death rates in the post-independence period.

This population decline presents a challenge to Barbados maintaining and advancing its social and
economic and achievements. On the other hand, controlling the size of the population has the
benefits  of  reducing  the  human  footprint  on  the  environment  including  through  reduction  in
waste, demand for scarce water and maintaining a level of green spaces needed for sustaining
ecological management.

To achieve its vision of a Barbados that is modern, socially just, innovative and productive, the
Government  of  Barbados,  looking  forward,  seeks  to  respond  to  the  negative  consequences  of
population decline while maintaining the positive aspects related to availability of green spaces
and ecological balance.

This Population Policy, an instrument of planning for the future, affirms the aspirations for social

5

justice, sustainable and inclusive development. Its overarching purpose is:

“To  promote  sustainable  and  inclusive  development  and  good  quality  of  life  for
Barbadians and residents without compromising environmental sustainability and the
ability of future generations to meet their needs.”

It outlines three inter-related policy goals. The first, which is a demographic, proposes short- and
long-term  approaches  to  ensuring  and maintaining  a  population  structure  to  ensure  adequate
levels  of  care  and  economic  and  social  vibrancy;  the  second  speaks  to  human  security  for  all
present  and future  generations;  and  the  third  goal  addresses  the  management  of interactions
between  people  and  the  environment  to  secure  the  ecological  balance  now  and  for  future
generations.

This objective can be realized through the pursuit of demographic and non-demographic
goals as follows:

Policy Goal 1: Ensure a Population
Size Sufficient to Grow and Sustain
Adequate Levels of Social Care,
Productivity, Labour Force Participation
and Revenue for Inclusive
Development

• Sub-Goal 1.1: Increase the
population of persons of
working age.

• Sub-Goal 1.2: Enhance Family

Wellbeing to Support Reproductive
Decision Making

Policy Goal 2: Provide
Barbadians and Non-Nationals
Now and in the Future with
Opportunities for Personal
Development

• Sub-Goal 2.1: Promote

and Strengthen the Care
Economy across the
Lifecycle and for the
Vulnerable Populations

• Sub-Goal 2.2: Expand Access
to Quality Health Care and
Wellness Service
Interventions

• Sub-Goal 2.3: Improve

Capacity and Proficiency of
the Labour Force with
Access to Expanded
Opportunities

Policy Goal 3: Promote Integrated,
Settlement Development and
Safeguard the Ecological Balance.

•
• Sub-Goal 3.1: Reconcile Population

Redistribution, Land Use and
Settlement Patterns

• Sub-Goal 3.2: Ensure the Efficient

Management of Natural Resources
and the Environment.

• Sub-Goal 3.3: Strengthen

Collective Resilience to the
Impacts of Changing Climate

The Policy addresses domains beyond those that are directly related to the size and structure of
the population. It does so because how the state responds to the needs of the population, how
the  people  take  care  for  each  other  and  how  the  ecology  and  environment  is  managed  and
regulated  all  have  a  direct  interactive  effect  on  population  dynamics.  There  is  a  reciprocal
relationship between the capacity of the state to care for its people (through education, health,
environmental management, social protection, human rights etc.) and the size and capacities of
the population to make contributions to the state through, for example, labour force participation
and taxation measures and to communities and families through social care.

This Policy does not stand on its own but rather should be considered as a component of the
integrated and sectoral policy approaches that reflect the aspirations of Barbadians for a society

6

characterized by economic development, environmental sustainability, ecological balance, social
justice  and  security,  food  security,  universal  access  to  sexual  and  reproductive  health,  social
inclusion, gender equality and human rights.

While  promoting  population  growth,  the  Population  Policy  is  not  prescriptive  about  increase
targets. Rather, it speaks to three main ways to achieve growth in population size. The first is
through managed migration, an approach that is likely to increase the population of working age
persons in the short- and medium term. The second is through policies that promote repatriation
of  Barbadians  or  their  continuous  engagement  with  social  and  economic  life  though  resident
elsewhere. The third is by supporting reproductive decision-making through the strengthening of
an enabling and supportive environment for families.

There  are  ways  of  devising  targets  for  the  population  growth  though  with  varying  degrees  of
credibility.

One way would be based on the projection of what the size of the population would have been if
fertility rates were maintained at 2.1 since 1980s and assuming the continuation of death and
migration trends. In such a scenario, by 2020 the population would have been 360,000 and by
2050, it would be an estimated 400,000.

Another way of arriving at a numerical target would be to calculate actual and projected labour
force  needs  which  respond  to  existing  labour  force  gaps  and  to  projections  of  the  skills  and
numbers  of  persons  needed  to  meet  industrial  development  plans.  Setting  such  a  numerical
target for an increase in the working age population has some urgency but must be informed by
industrial and labour force policies.

Another approach is to link population size to desired economic growth targets. The potential
impact,  whether  beneficial,  detrimental  or  non-existent,  between  population  growth  and
economic growth is, however, a complex matter. Economic growth is influenced by the structure,
size or composition of a country’s population but also by other factors including the social and
economic history of the country and the surrounding region, the structure of the economy, its
location in the global political economy, and existing social and finance infrastructure and policies,
particularly in the areas of health, sanitation, education and governance.1

It is also possible to be guided by the population size of countries which have higher population
densities and higher GDP per capita than Barbados. This would include countries like Bermuda
and Singapore. But this would be simplistic, and could not withstand scrutiny. It should be noted
that there are countries with a lower population density than Barbados but with a higher GDP per
capita (Aruba, San Marino, Republic of Korea and the Netherlands).2 And there are many countries
with larger populations and very poor social and economic development indicators.

Given these complexities, the Population Policy does not recommend a specific numerical goal

1 See Appendix 3: Technical Note on the Potential Relationship/Impact of Population Growth on Economic Growth.
2 Appendix 3: Technical Note: An Examination of the Population Density and Gross Domestic Product per capita

7

for population growth, though it does recommend an incremental increase in population size can
be achieved through, the adoption a managed migration policy.

As  a  justifiable  starting  point,  the  formulation  of  population  targets  can  be  informed  by
considering the size that the population that the country would have realized if the replacement
fertility rate had been maintained since 1980. In this regard, by 2050, the population would have
been approximately 400,000.

While  there  is  a  lack  of  consensus  on  the  nexus  of  population  growth  and  economic  growth,
investment in social capital is recognised has as a catalyst to the development of countries, which
is also why the Population Policy includes a goal on providing Barbadians and Non-Nationals Now
and in the Future are with Opportunities for Personal and Social Capital Development.

The demographic and supporting non-demographic goals are:

Goal 1: Ensure a Population Size Sufficient to Grow and Sustain Adequate Levels of Social Care,
Productivity, Labour Force Participation and Revenue for Inclusive Development

Sub-goal 1.1: Increase the Population of Persons of Working Age
  Extend the categories of persons entitled to citizenship and permanent residence;
  Retain and encourage repatriation of Barbadians and stem the brain drain; and
  Promote managed migration of persons who can bring capabilities and resources to invest in
the future of Barbados and to contribute to areas of the economy where there are unmet
labour and skills requirements.

Sub-Goal 1. 2: Enhance Family Wellbeing to Support Reproductive Decision Making
  Reduce the structural barriers to childbearing and support fertility decision-making
  Ensure  non-discriminatory  and  age-appropriate  access  to  sexual  and  reproductive

information, and services across the life cycle.

Policy  Goal  2:  Provide  Barbadians  and  Non-Nationals  Now  and  in  the  Future  are  with
Opportunities for Personal Development

Sub-goal 2.1: Promote and Strengthen the Care Economy across the Lifecycle and for the
Vulnerable Population
  Promote workplace practices that support caregiving responsibilities.
  Promote, recognise and support equitable sharing of care responsibilities within families and

activities across the life cycle.

Sub-goal 2.3: Improve the Capacity and Proficiency of the Labour Force with Access to Expanded
Opportunities


Improve  primary,  secondary,  and  tertiary  education  to  strengthen  the  delivery  of  science,
technology,  engineering,  and  mathematics  (STEM)  subjects  and  inculcate  innovation,
entrepreneurial behaviour and issues related to the acquisition of soft skills.

  Promotion of technical and vocational education and training (TVET) and the implementation
of a dual-track TVET system where institutional instruction is complemented by practical work
and experience.

  Establish  partnerships  with

faith-based
organizations, and labour unions, specifically targeting youth not in employment, education,
or  training  (NEET)  to  assist  them  with  capitalizing  on  such  opportunities  for  training  and
prospects for becoming employable and/or employed.

families,  community-based  organizations,

  Continued  development  of  labour  market  data  systems  and  development  of  institutional
linkages for the realisation of a comprehensive labour market information system which is
accessible and current.

Policy  Goal  3:  Promote  Integrated  Settlement  Development  and  Safeguard  the  Ecological
Balance

Sub-goal 3.1: Reconcile Population Redistribution, Land Use and Settlement Patterns
  Promotion of the designation of Predominantly Residential Areas to be areas located within
the  Urban  Corridor,  Stable  Suburban  Areas  and  National  Park  Villages,  and intended  to  be
developed as compact and complete communities.

  Designate an extensive area outside of the Urban Corridor and National Park as a  Working
Landscape  for  the  harmonious  co-existence  and  management  of  agricultural  production,
renewable energy initiatives, resource extraction, solid waste management and a mixture of
essential infrastructural services.

Sub-goal 3.2: Ensure the Efficient Management of Natural Resources and the Environment
  Strengthen an integrated decision-making framework for development initiatives to safeguard

our essential ecosystem services and reduce vulnerability to natural hazards.

  Ensure  that  environmental,  legal,  economic  and  social  tenets  of  Barbados’  Sustainable
Development Policy are considered in the management of population structure and size as
well as any population development strategies.

Sub-goal 3.3: Strengthen Collective Resilience to the Impacts of a Changing Climate
  Promote forward planning through the utilisation of the national, regional and community
physical  development  plans  to  integrate  climate  change  as  a  cross-cutting  consideration
across all components of land use planning, natural resources management and development
management.
Introduce ecosystem-based interventions combined with existing strategies to improve



ecosystem health, address climate change and known coastal hazards.

  Strengthen governance and partnerships between the public sector, private organisations and
non- governmental organisations to harness scarce resources and build capacity to combat
the effects of climate change and the wider spectrum of disaster risk management activities.

###  Implementation Framework

The Population Policy is cross-sectoral and multidimensional, and its implementation will depend
on the engagement of the Government, social partners, civil society actors, trade unions, private
sector and communities. It should be accompanied by a plan of action developed by an Inter-
sectoral  Implementation  Group  (ISIG)  which  will  be  the  framework  for  the  design,  financing,
monitoring and evaluation, collaboration, and coordination of the Plan. The Plan of Action should
identify responsible and lead agencies  for the implementation of the goals and sub-goals. The
plan of action should contain time-bound commitments and be adequately resourced to ensure
accountability for implementation.

Cross-cutting themes:

Recurring themes from the consultations which informed this Policy are i) gender equality in the
sharing  of  care  responsibilities  and  ii) the urgency of  education  reform away  from testing  and
towards an affirmative experience that draws out and values the diversities of individual skills and
competencies  and  grows  cultural  confidence;  and  iii)  the  strengthening  of  environmental
management.

Family and community caregiving is still a gendered experience, given the traditional division of
labour which ascribes to women the predominant responsibility for care of children, the elderly
and vulnerable populations. This work continues to go under-valued and under-recognised. While
there are cultural shifts, these must be accelerated through regulation, resources and education
so that women and men can contribute to family and public life in ways that broaden their choices
based on mutual obligations to care and protect families.

The education sector should strengthen diverse civic engagement, labour market productivity,
security and more comprehensive experiences of fairness and inclusion. An education sector re-
envisaged away from the colonial and post-colonial focus on testing and realigned to the rounded
development needs of individuals and communities is also desirable to respond to the causes and
consequences of the projected population trends.

Barbados  has  championed  environmental  management,  and  this  must  be  sustained  and
amplified.  The  Policy  seeks  to  outline  strategies  for  managing  the  interactions  between  the
population  and  the  natural  environment  to  secure  the  ecological  balance  needed  for  a  good
quality of life now and for future generations.

 Introduction

The Government of Barbados, sensitive to the demographic transition into an aging population,
constituted a National Population Commission (NPC) to analyse the implications and to prepare
an evidence-based population policy for the period 2024-2040. This population policy outlines
strategies that will increase the likelihood that Barbados continues to have a population size and
balanced  age  structure  to  achieve  its  economic,  social  and  cultural  development  goals.  The
Barbados Population Policy is part of planning for the future.

The Barbados Population Policy responds to projections in population structure and size based
on trends over the last 40 years:

●  Consistent fertility rates below the replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman;
●  Growth in the proportion of the elderly population;
●  Declining percentage of persons of working age; and
●  Higher dependency ratios due to a reducing number of persons of working age and greater

proportion of elderly persons.

These trends can negatively affect economic growth, impede the capacity of the state to raise
revenue to meet the social care and security needs of its population, including the financing of
universal  health  care,  social  security  and  education.  Additionally,  the  aging  nature  of  the
population  means  that  there  will  be  increased  numbers  of  people  requiring  care  and  being
dependent on a decreasing number of persons of working age. Declining proportions of working
age  people  will  also  affect  the  labour  force  and  may  undermine  the  prospects  of  sustaining  a
dynamic and diversified economy.

Apart from addressing the demographic trends, the Population Policy recognizes that a socially
cohesive population is the precondition for the attainment of a modern, caring, innovative, and
productive society and economy. Barbadians and residents must have expanded and equitable
opportunities to meet personal development goals, and to make contributions to the culture and
economy  grounded  in  feelings  of  belonging  and  obligations  of  mutual  care,  and  care  for  the
environment.

Barbados  should  be  characterized  by  inclusive  development,  environmental  sustainability,
ecological  balance,  social  security,  food  security,  universal  access  to  sexual  and  reproductive
health, social inclusion, gender equality and human rights.

A population policy is part of a suite of policy measures to address the current and anticipated
developmental challenges and opportunities. Barbados is heavily dependent for its revenue on
the services sector and in particular tourism. With limited manufacturing, most goods used by the
population are imported. This has led to balance of trade deficits over many years and increasing
indebtedness to meet Barbados’ fuel and food needs.

11

Responding  to  an  economic  structure  that  is  dependent  on  tourism  and  with  insufficient
diversification, one of the goals of the government is to regenerate and sustain an economy that
is  driven  by  and  benefits  Barbadians  who  are  equipped  with  the  capabilities  to  innovate  and
produce for self-reliance and to compete in the dynamic global market. As such, the population
should  be  knowledge-based  and  skilled  for  a  diversity  of  occupations,  thereby  increasing  the
prospects for attracting value-added industries and providing decent working conditions.

The  post-independence  social  contract  recognizes  the  state’s  obligation  to  provide  universal
access to quality free education and training, quality universal healthcare, access to affordable
land  and  housing,  the  protection  of  public  spaces  and  the  environment,  respect  for  diversity,
fundamental freedoms, rights and responsibilities and equality under the law. The ability of the
country  to  achieve  these  goals  is  critically  dependent  upon  population  structure  and  size,  its
growth, its spatial distribution and its socio-demographic profile.

This  Population  Policy  affirms  the  aspirations  for  social  justice,  sustainable  and  inclusive
development. The overarching purpose of the Barbados National Population Policy is:

“To promote sustainable and inclusive development and good quality of life for Barbadians and
residents  without  compromising  environmental  sustainability  and  the  ability  of  future
generations to meet their needs.”

It outlines three inter-related policy goals. The first, which is a demographic, proposes short- and
long-term approaches to maintaining a population structure to ensure adequate levels of care
and economic and social vibrancy; the second speaks to human security for all present and future
generations; and the third goal addresses the management of interactions between people and
the environment to secure the ecological balance now and for future generations.

The Policy addresses domains beyond those that are directly related to the size and structure of
the population (beyond demography). The Population Policy necessarily touches on and should
complement other policy spaces, such as economic affairs, social protection and development,
gender equality, urban planning, education, labour, the environment and health.
It does so because how the state and people take care of each other, and how the ecology and
environment is managed, and regulated has a direct interactive effect on population dynamics.
For this reason, across the goals, the Population Policy emphasizes the need for contribution and
care. There is a reciprocal relationship between the capacity of the state to take care of its people
(through  education,  health,  environmental  management,  social  protection,  human  rights  etc.)
and  the  capacities  of  the  population  to  make  contributions  to  the  state  through  taxation
measures and to communities and families through social care. Increasing the population size and
strengthening a diversity of capacities of the current population creates more opportunities for
more  people  to  contribute  to  the  economy,  government  revenue,  the  labour  market,  social
development and cultural expression.

12

Process of Policy Formulation

Under  the  auspices  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  Economic  Affairs  and  Investment,  a  National
Population Commission (NPC) was commissioned in 2019. A Population Situational Analysis (PSA)
was developed based on broad stakeholder consultations and a review of the relevant literature.
This exercise was completed during the first quarter of 2020 and outlines the issues arising from
an aging population to which this Population Policy responds.

This Policy was informed by the Barbados PSA and by a series of consultations with a wide cross-
section of stakeholder groups between July 2022 and April2023 (See Appendix 1). Through these
consultations, the Population Commission was guided in the development of the priority realms
of policy that would respond to and ameliorate the challenging consequences of a declining and
aging population.

 Barbados Development Context

Barbados, like many other countries, is grappling with the lingering impacts of the Coronavirus
(COVID-19), on the social and economic development of the country. As of June 7, 2023, there
were  over  767.6  million  confirmed  cases  and  approximately  6.9  million  deaths  worldwide,
associated with the Coronavirus pandemic. In addition to the human toll, the pandemic had a
severe impact on the economy, because of the preventive measures instituted globally to contain
the spread of the virus, inclusive of partial and full economic shutdowns as well as travel and trade
restrictions.  Consequently,  the  local  economy  contracted  by  12.7  per  cent  in  2020,  with  the
Accommodation and Food services industry being the most impacted with a decline of 58.3 per
cent recorded.

Furthermore,  the  COVID-19  along  with  several  recent  natural  disasters3,  have  dampened  the
country’s substantial progress towards achieving macro-economic and fiscal stability through the
implementation of the Barbados Economic Recovery and Transformation Plan, 2018 (BERT 2018).
The BERT was introduced in October 2018 as part of a four-year International Monetary Fund
(IMF)  agreement  under  the  Extended  Fund  Facility  (EFF)  and  sought  to  rectify  the  country’s
economic  challenges  through  measures  to  “restore  macroeconomic  and  debt  sustainability,
address  falling  reserves,  and  increase  growth”4.  Within  the  decade  prior  to  2018,  the  local
economy  was  characterised  by  low  growth;  averaging  -0.4  per  cent  between  2008  to  2017;
unsustainable high levels of debt, which stood at approximately 176.3 per cent of GDP at end of
2017/18; and low foreign exchange reserves, which stood at 6.1 weeks of import cover in 2017,
well below the accepted international standard of twelve weeks of import cover. The country’s
reputation as a credible borrower was also in dispute, due to multiple downgrades by credit rating
agencies, which undermined its capacity to access the capital markets at favourable conditions.

Through the implementation of the BERT 2018, critical structural reforms were implemented in
the areas of growth, tax administration, State Owned- Enterprises (SOE); and fiscal, public sector
and monetary policy. By March 2020, the gross foreign reserves increased to 18.6 weeks of import
cover; while public debt was reduced to 117.4 percent of GDP in FY2019/20. However, the onset
of the pandemic and recent natural disasters required extensive policy responses to alleviate the
current challenges and ameliorate the impact on household and livelihoods. As a result of the
increase required in public expenditure along with the contraction of the overall economy, public
debt to GDP rose to 151.2 per cent by the end of FY 2020/21.

Despite the extensive changes in the global and local landscapes, Barbados’ economy remains
insufficiently diversified, with service-related industries representing the main drivers of growth.
Over the period, 2008 to 2022, Accommodation and Food services  (12.0 per cent), Real Estate
(9.6 per cent) and Wholesale & Retail Trade (8.9 per cent), accounted for the highest share of GDP
on average. While on average, Wholesale & Retail Trade (19.9 per cent), Accommodation

and Food services (14.5 per cent) and Construction, Mining & Quarrying (12. 4 per cent) industries
provided the largest source of employment.

Private employment has and continues to be the predominant form of employment in Barbados.
Government  employment  has  increased  modestly,  while  the  most  significant  change  in
employment status has been among the self-employed. Self-employment increased from 12 per
cent of the employed in 1995 to 18 per cent in 2022.

The rate of labour force participation has been declining since 1995. This is especially stark for
youth whose numbers have declined by almost 50 per cent between 1995 and 2017, and youth
unemployment stands at 35.1% as at 2022. The rate of inactivity among youth is high in part due
to youth being in education or job training. However, there is an estimated 18 per cent of youth
in  2010,  who  were  not  in  employment,  education  or  training  (NEET).  There  has  also  been  an
increase in the number of people who are unemployed for an extended period.

The effects of the pandemic on the economy increased levels of unemployment, from a rate of
10.1 per cent in 2019 to 14.1 per cent in 2021. However, as the country enters a post-COVID-19
period,  there  are  favourable  signs  recovery,  particular  in  the  tourism  sector,  with  stay-over
arrivals rebounding to 63.9 per cent of pre-COVID- 19 levels in 2022. Unemployment fell to 8.4
per cent in 2022 and an improvement was also observed in the country fiscal position as debt to
GDP ratio fell to 125 per cent GDP in July 2022.

To  support  of  the  country’s  recovery  process,  the  Government  of  Barbados  introduced  the
Barbados Economic Recovery and Transformation Plan 2.0 in 2022, which seeks to maintain the
gains achieved under BERT 2018 and complete the intended “structural reforms to better position
the country for macroeconomic stability and medium-term growth.” This will include the pursuit
of:
  a growth policy that advances developments in the areas of energy, tourism, transport and
agriculture; enhances the local business environment; and incentivise the green transition and
building climate resilient infrastructure.
the requisite fiscal strategy and public sector reforms to support entry into international
capital markets;



  a debt management strategy, to position the country towards a path of debt sustainability;



and
initiatives which promote social cohesion and eradicate poverty, inclusive of investments in
skill training and education, and low- income housing.

 Overview of the Population Dynamics

The Barbados Population Situation Analysis (PSA) outlines current Barbadian population dynamics
and the impact on economic development, labour market conditions, spatial planning and the
use of health services and environmental management. Key trends which shape the Population
Policy include:

Population Size and Growth

In 1960, the size of the population of Barbados was approximately 230,980. At the time of the
2010 Population and Housing Census, the population of Barbados was approximately 277,821 of
which 52 percent were female and 48 percent male. By the 2021 Population and Housing Census,
the population was estimated at 269,090 persons, a decrease of 8,731 persons since 2010.5 In
essence, between 1960 and 2021 the population of Barbados only increased by 16.5%.

Live Births and Fertility

The number of live births in Barbados has declined from a maximum of more than 7,000 annually
during the 1950s and early 1960s to a low in the vicinity of 2,500 in 2018. The total fertility rate
(the average number of live births per woman in the reproductive age groups) declined from 4.3
in 1960 to 1.8 in 2017. Barbados is therefore currently below the replacement fertility level of 2.1
children per woman. Adolescent fertility, while significant, declined from 50.5 per 1,000 girls aged
15-19 in 2000 to 33.6 per 1,000 girls aged 15-19 in 2015.6

Deaths and Mortality

Between  1950  and  the  mid-1980s,  the  annual  number  of  deaths  declined  notably.  The  life
expectancy  at  birth  for  2021  was  estimated  to  be  77.4  years,  which  is  amongst  the  most
favourable for  CARICOM  countries.  This  is  attributable  to  improvements  in  public  health  care,
water and sanitation, as well as the positive impacts of public health on infant and child mortality.

is

The health profile of Barbados has significantly changed over the past 50 years. There has been a
transition from diseases related to malnutrition, poor sanitation and infections to a disease profile
that
impacted  by  chronic  non-communicable  diseases  (NCDs),  new  and  emerging
communicable diseases, a rapidly aging population and climate change. The primary burden for
the health system is related to NCDs. Among the Barbadian population, almost 40% have one or
more  of  the  risk  factors  for  NCDs.  Not  unexpectedly,  there  has  been  an  uptick  in  death  rates
associated with an aging population and prevalence of NCDs.

Population Growth Due to Natural Increase

This steady decline in the number of live births, and the rising number of deaths (associated with
the aging Barbadian population) means that the population growth rate will continue to fall. At
the point where the number of live births and the number of deaths is equal, the population of
Barbados will stop increasing, unless offset by high levels of net migration.

International Migration

Barbadians, like other Caribbean people, have emigrated primarily for educational, income and
quality of life considerations. Such emigration was most marked in the post-independence period
between  1965-1980.  With  the  tightening  up  of  immigration  laws  in  the  traditional  receiving
counties (UK, US, and Canada), emigration has decreased significantly though there continues to
be movement between Caribbean states, especially since the institution of free movement in the
Caribbean Single Market and Economy regime.

Immigration  has  also  been  significant  and  the  UN  projects  that  as  much  as  12  percent  of  the
resident population of Barbados are immigrants, mainly from other Caribbean countries such as
Guyana, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, St. Lucia and Trinidad and Tobago. Over half (55 percent)
are women and three quarters are aged 15-64 years.8

Still, it is estimated that Barbados has a net loss of population of approximately 400 persons per
annum due to migration; that is, the number of emigrants from Barbados exceeds the number of
immigrants entering Barbados by on average 400 persons.

Changing Age Dependency Burden

Declining  fertility  rates  have  resulted  in  smaller  families  with  a  smaller  burden  of  childcare
obligations (fewer children in the home). As a result, the youth dependency ratio (the population
younger  than  15  years  relative  to  the  working-age  population,  15-64  years)  has  been  steadily
decreasing and was 29 per 100 as of 2016. This decreasing burden of care for the young however
continues  to  be  offset  by  increases  in  the  elderly  dependency  ratio  (population  of  older
dependents over 64 years relative to the working-age population aged 15-64 years) which in 2016
was estimated at 22 per 100 and expected to reach 33.3 per 100 by 2025.

The overall age dependency ratio in Barbados is calculated to be 49 per 100 in 2021. This is a
significant decrease from 75.7 in 1960.9 Given the stabilization of fertility rates and the increases
in  the  population  65  years  or  older,  there  will  be  fewer  people  of  working  age  in  contrast  to
populations under 15 and over 64.

Population Redistribution

Two-thirds of the population resides along the “Urban Corridor” situated less than two kilometres
from the coastline. Economic activity related to tourism and infrastructure concentration in and
near coastal zones increases Barbados’ vulnerability to the impacts of climate change such as sea
level  rise  and  storm  surge.  Coastal  zone  development  has  also  degraded  marine  habitats,
especially coral reefs which have declined in mass by 70% since the 1970s.

There  has  been  outward  migration  from  St. Michael and the  City of  Bridgetown  and  from the
eastern parishes of St. John, St. Joseph and St. Andrew between 1970 and 2010. Concomitantly,

9 https://databank.worldbank.org/source/population-estimates-and-projections

20

there has been population growth in suburban and peri-urban areas in the parishes of St. James,
St. Thomas, St. George and Christ Church, and in many rural areas of the parish of St. Philip. In
these parishes, there has been significant land conversion from traditionally agricultural use to
residential and commercial development.

Population Density

Using the latest census data, Barbados had an overall population density of 622 people per square
kilometre. Even though this is a decrease from 2010 (666), Barbados still has the highest density
among  member  states  of  the  Caribbean  Community  (CARICOM),  though  not  as  high  as  non-
CARICOM countries of St. Maarten and Bermuda, which have population densities of 1,261 and
1,185 persons per square kilometre, respectively.

Projected Population Size in Barbados 2020-2040

Prior to the data from the 2021 census, projections based on fertility and mortality trends, and
with  no  catastrophic  events  resulting  in  migration  to  or  from  Barbados,  suggested  that  the
population  of  Barbados  was  expected  to  peak  at  290,000  sometime  around  2029  and  then
projected to begin a gradual decline in its size in the 2030s.

Within that scenario, the size of the working-age population, 15-64 years, was projected to peak
around the year 2021/2022 at 189,730. While the proportion of those under 15 was expected to
continue to decline, with consistent increases in the number of elderly people aged 65 years or
older  between  2020-2050.  However,  the  population  size  data  for  2021  already  suggests
population decline- 269,090 from 277,821 in 2010.

Projected Non-demographic impacts

Possible decreases in state revenue

One of the main sources of government revenue is taxation on income as well as on consumption
of  goods  and  services.  Reduced  population,  particularly  in  the  cohort  of  the  working  age,  can
decrease revenue derived from employment-related taxation measures. Similarly, decreases in
population size can also affect the levels of consumption and therefore revenue generated

22

through  value-added tax.  Given  the  structure of the  current economy  and  labour  market,  it  is
unlikely that the levels of taxation derived from employment and consumption, can be increased
to offset the reduced numbers of persons of working age.

Decreases  in  taxation  revenues  will  directly  impact  the  state’s  capacity  to  maintain  and
strengthen social development approaches such as universal education and health care, as well
as infrastructure, and economic development measures.

State revenue needs can be addressed through macroeconomic approaches that focus on such
activities as attracting foreign direct investment and expanding domestic production and exports.
However, revenue flows from taxation on investments are subject to international taxation rules
and are not within the control of the Barbadian state. 10

Social Security and Social Protection

Similarly, declining numbers of people of working age and increases in retired persons has a direct
impact  on  the  sustainability  of  the  social  security  scheme.  In  all  but  one  year  since  2014,
expenditure  exceeded  contribution  income  under  this  programme.  Between  2018-2020,  the
number  of  NIS  contributors  decreased  each  year,  while  the  number  of  pensioners  and  total
pension payouts increased each year. With continued population trends, the total expenditure of
the National Insurance Fund is expected to exceed total income each year and therefore, the Fund
is expected to be depleted between 2034 and 2041.11

While there are demands on the state to provide national assistance and care facilities for the
elderly, other sub-populations are beneficiaries of social protection through a variety of state-
sponsored programmes. There are also cash and in-kind benefits including National Assistance
Grants, food vouchers, disability grants, foster grants and assistance with rental, burial and house
repair. For the benefit of children attending school, there are student support schemes including
school feeding programmes, uniforms provision, textbooks loan programmes, examination fee
subsidies and free transport. Day care services are made available by the state and target poor
infants and young children, while a range of social care services targeting different constituents

10 In October 2021, 137 countries under the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD)/G20
Inclusive Framework for Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, agreed to a two-pillar strategy to reform the global
tax regime, to tackle tax avoidance, improve the coherence of international tax rules, ensure a more transparent tax
environment and address the tax challenges arising from digitalization. Part of the reform is said to be to dissuade
unproductive/ ineffective tax competition among countries, by instituting a floor corporate tax rate. The long-term
implications of these global rules domestically is unknown but it is recognized that the adoption of these measures,
effectively removes the ability of developing countries such as Barbados to utilize low tax based incentives as part of
their toolkit to attract investment and compete on the global stage.

include counselling for troubled families and children, counselling services for abused women,
homes for children and the elderly, and home-based care for the elderly.

The  anticipated  reductions  in  income  and  consumption  taxation  revenue  due  todeclining
populations  of  working  age,  unless  offset  by other  taxation  measures,  will  also  jeopardize  the
state’s  capacity  to  maintain  and  expand  social  protection.  State  incapacity  to  deliver  social
protection services is also likely to have a disproportionately negative effect on women given the
traditional division of labour within which women bear the responsibility of care for children, the
sick and the elderly.

Labour Supply

Current  trends, if they persist,  will  yield declines  in  the  prospective  numbers  of  young  people
entering the labour market during periods when increasingly larger numbers of older people will
be  exiting the  labour  market.  Such  changes  will  place  increasing  levels of  stress  on  the  labour
force which would witness a decline in its size commencing in 2035.

The impact on the economy because of these changes in the supply of labour include declines in
the savings rate as older persons draw down on their assets to support themselves, likely declines
in productivity, creativity and innovation, and taxation revenue reductions. Additionally, as the
population ages, the state will have to increase provisions for social security and social protection
programmes  targeting  a  large  and  growing  elderly  population,  especially  those  who  would  be
living on the margins and classified among the vulnerable because they are poor and/or without
family support.

Health Care

Projected  increases  in  the  number  of  persons  over  65  are  accompanied  by  the  prevalence  of
chronic non-communicable diseases, especially diabetes and hypertension. Barbados has been
characterized as having an adult population that is overweight (2 in every 3 people) and obese (1
in every 3 people) with females being more overweight/obese than males. For the period 2020-
2050, forecasts indicate that the care of the elderly may account for just under 20 percent of total
health expenditure. This is further compounded by the fact that the growing population of elderly
persons may create a need for increasingly greater allocations of space in elder care facilities due
principally to concomitant changes in the family dynamics, work arrangements and the structure
of households.

Family Arrangements and Care

A larger proportion of men live alone than women whose households tend to be larger and may
not  include  employed  male  adults.  Poor  female-headed  households  have  higher  dependency
levels amounting to 74.8% non-earners per household compared to 68.6% in the case of poor
male-headed households.

24

In Barbados, elderly persons mostly live within private households with just 4% being resident in
institutions of care.

A higher proportion of older adults receive rather than provide support, regardless of  whether
they live with or away from their children. Women, and in particular daughters, are principally
the  primary  caretakers  of  the  elderly  providing  them  with  physical,  emotional  and  financial
support. Moreover, elderly mothers have higher odds of receiving all forms of support from their
children  when  compared  to  fathers.  Among  those  in  institutions  of  care,  63%  are  men  and  in
general, older men are more likely than older women to be isolated from familial networks of
care.

It  is  likely  that  more  older  men  are  in  institutional  care  because  of  being  isolated  from  their
families due to life choices made during their working ages. Certainly, nearly one third of men live
alone according to the 2010 census. Adult women are less likely to live alone, having  regard to
the female realm of responsibility for the care of children and the elderly.

Planning for care of the elderly will have to include a focus on socialization to ensure that, on an
equal  basis  with  women,  men  understand  the  obligation  and  value  of  sharing  of  care
responsibilities across their life cycle, and for the emotional, physical and material care of their
children. That will ensure their integration, on a basis of reciprocity, within familial care bonds.

Spatial Infrastructure and the Environment

Traditionally,  there  has  been  a  concentration  of  residential  and  commercial  properties  along
narrow  coastal  strips  of  land  primarily  along  the  west  and  south-western  coastal  areas  of
Barbados. There are the usual concerns surrounding that balance between changes in population
size attributes and the supply of housing and land use choices.

Population  redistribution  away  from  coastal  areas  has  resulted
in  new  housing  units
mushrooming in spaces previously the preserve of agricultural production. This population spread
has been  accompanied by a  reliance on  the  private ownership of  automobiles,  the  number  of
which has increased notably in Barbados during the last two decades. The average annual growth
rate  in  the  motor  vehicular  population  in  Barbados  has  been  3.85%,  notably  greater  than  the
acceptable standard of 2.5% which prevails internationally. The continued car-centric planning
evidenced  by  the  rise  of  several  sub-urban  shopping  complexes  and  new  suburban  dormitory
settlements without basic neighbourhood services may be linked to increased inactivity among
individuals  and  chronic  non-communicable  diseases  as  well  as  the  slow  death  of  traditionally
vibrant  historic  coastal  centres  like  the  capital,  Bridgetown,  as  many  businesses  and  residents
have moved away.

Policies promoting increased population must be accompanied by a land use policy to prevent
and/or  mitigate  habitat  loss,  pressure  on  biodiversity  and  reduced  cultivable  land,  the  latter
placing threats on the island’s capacity to build resilience regarding its food security.

 The Population Dilemma

Barbados is likely to have progressed past that window of opportunity known as the demographic
dividend characterized by a relatively large working-age population due to declining fertility and
increasingly smaller populations in the childhood stages of the life cycle, and relatively smaller
but gradually growing elderly populations. Such an age structure is highly advantageous because
it results in increased proportions of people of working age being active in the economy and as
care providers for young and elderly dependents.

Already by 2021, Barbados has seen an actual decline in population, a decline that was projected
to  take place  a  decade  later.  Without  any interventions,  the  size  and  structure  of  Barbados  is
certain to continue in a manner consistent with a rapidly aging society with a high dependency
ratio.

Population aging has social and economic implications. These include an eventual decline in the
population of working age, declining rates of labour force participation and workforce shortages
as  retirees  outnumber  new  entrants  to  the  workforce.  There  are  also  likely  to  be  greater
prospects  of  a  decline  in  savings  rate  as  older  persons  draw  down  on  their  assets  to  support
themselves; a decline in productivity and innovation; and increased burden of care not only for
family members but also for the state through social security and social protection programmes.

With an aging population, the fiscal balancing act of ensuring revenue generation sufficient to
meet core public sector expenditure is threatened. Economic productivity and dynamism cannot
be assured without a working-population that is well-educated, versatile, innovative, creative and
sufficient in size to make the contributions needed to care for children, the elderly and others
who are dependent on the state.

Given  the  current  population  projections,  unless  interventions  are  developed,  Barbados  will
become a steadily greying society and the state’s capacity to maintain the expected social

27

investments  will  be  compromised  and  the  benefits  of  a  more  youthful  population  will  be
diminished.

It must be pointed out that a shrinking population can also have positive effects, particularly for
the  environment.  The  benefits  can  include  reduced  strain  on  resources  (e.g.,  less  traffic
congestion,  pollution,  waste,  water  use  etc.),  decreased  dependencies  at  individual  and
household  levels,  reduced  state  expenditure  on  some  kinds  of  infrastructure  associated  with
population  usage  and  greater  levels  of  disposable  income  for  some.  A  low  or  no  growth
population  trend  can  also  enhance  the  expansion  and  access  to  green  spaces  important  for
community life and wellbeing.

Additionally, there are technologies available to undertake many tasks previously associated with
people across a range of sectors in both the public and private sectors. Automation, digitalization,
use of robotics and artificial intelligence are replacing traditional jobs, and particularly relatively
unskilled  and  low  paying  sectors.  Automation  is  also  associated  with  increased  efficiency,
productivity and economic growth  and therefore population size and structure needs must be
aligned with the effects of the acceleration of use of technologies and artificial intelligence.

Still,  the  negative  consequences of  an  aging  population  must  be addressed to  ensure that  the
Barbadian state can fulfil its social contract and has the capacity to facilitate a decent quality of
life  across  the  life  cycle.  The  challenge  in  increasing  the  population  size  is  to  ensure  that  all
residents  can  enjoy  productive  lives  and  attain  personal  development  goals  while  centring
ecological and environmental conservation.

28

 The Role and Vision of the Barbados Population Policy

The  socio-economic  objectives  of  the  government  can  be  gleaned  from  the  two  Barbados
Economic  Recovery  and Transformation  Plans  (BERT)  2018  and  2022. This  plan  is  projected to
transform  the  public  finances  and  the  economy  of  Barbados  toward  promoting  a  new,  high-
skilled, knowledge-based and more diversified economy. The objectives outlined are seen also as
a  precondition  for  reducing  poverty  and  inequality  through  increasing  resources  available  for
social expenditure, generating employment and maintaining social protection schemes. It aims to
restore debt and fiscal sustainability, and key to this is investments in skills.

The ability of the country to embark on activities to achieve these social, economic, institutional
and environmental goals is partly dependent on the size, growth, distribution and structure of its
population as well as its investment in its human capital. Additionally, the nature and scope of
these activities ought to be formulated, designed and implemented to optimally serve the future
needs of the Barbadian population of all generations.

A population policy complements and should be aligned to national and sectoral development
policies in so far as it outlines how the population size and structure can contribute to the meeting
of economic, social and environmental development objectives.

This Population Policy responds primarily to the challenges associated with an aging population
and complements measures for achieving the short and long-term developmental objectives. It is
predicated on the understanding that Barbados is a social democratic state where the state has
obligations:

●  The state has the primary responsibility for human resource development (education, health)

and the social protection of vulnerable populations.

●  The state has a regulatory obligation regarding the ‘market’ - labour laws, financial

regulations, industrial policy etc.

●  The state has an obligation to regulate the use of natural resources to preserve benefits for

current and future generations.

●  The state has an obligation to establish regulatory frameworks for the orderly and progressive

development of land.

●  The state has redistributive obligations using tax and non-tax measures to address poverty

and inequalities.

●  The state has an obligation to establish protective measures to secure its population and

economy from extreme climatic events.

●  The state has a role to facilitate social interaction at household and community levels to

promote social care, social solidarity and cultural vibrancy and resilience.

Population Policy Principles and Goals

The Population Policy is guided by national development aspirations and policies, and national,
regional, and international human rights commitments to fairness, equality, non-discrimination
and social justice. In accordance with the International Conference on Population Development
and the Sustainable Development Goals, the Policy places individual dignity and human rights at
the heart of development.

It is predicated on Caribbean regionalism and is informed by the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas
and the CARICOM Single Market and Economy. The Policy must be implemented in a manner that
is consistent with ecological balance and environmental sustainability.

Overarching Population Policy Objective

The overarching policy objective of the Barbados Population Policy is:

“To promote sustainable and inclusive development and good quality of life for Barbadians and
residents  without  compromising  environmental  sustainability  and  the  ability  of  future
generations to meet their needs.”

This objective can be realized through the pursuit of demographic and non-demographic
goals as follows:

Policy Goal 1: Ensure a Population Size Sufficient to Grow and Sustain Adequate Levels of
Social  Care,  Productivity,  Labour  Force  Participation  and  Revenue  for
Inclusive
Development

Barbados needs both short-term and long-term approaches to ensure that it has the capacities
that provide a foundation for the State and for the people to take care of each other now and in
the future. Capabilities for caregiving are regenerated within the family and household through
intergenerational care, access to education, health, social services, and employment. The State is
capacitated through the generation of income and taxation revenue to maintain, modernise and
expand social security and infrastructure and reduce poverty through education, health and social
protection mechanisms.

An increase in population size, and especially those of working age, is just one component of such
approaches.

Labour force gaps and their effects can also be addressed through realignment of educational
processes to address structural barriers to achievement, and to meet current and projected skill
and expertise needs. The use of automation, information, digitization and artificial intelligence
technologies can also offset the negative effects of a reduced working age population. All these
measures should also enhance productivity.

Still, there is a certain irreducibility to the need for human care across the life cycle. And with an
economy that is oriented towards the service industries, maintaining a working age population
size that reduces dependency rates, and allows for sustained and reliable contributions to the
labour market, government revenue through taxation and social insurance schemes is vital.

In defining the size and structure of the population needed in the future, sustainability is a key
consideration.  Account  must  be  taken  of  natural  resources,  preservation  of  biodiversity,
environmental  and  infrastructural  carrying  capacity,  support  for  cultural  and  technological
creativity and  the  state’s  capacity to  provide basic  services.  Population size  increases must  be
informed by the limits beyond which human use will deplete the country’s non-renewable natural
resources.

But carrying capacity is not static and can be expanded by the application of technology which
adapts  and  expands  infrastructural  and  other  resources  and  services.  The  application  of
agricultural technologies can increase food yields, desalination plants can increase water supply,
and  efficient  public  transportation  can  lead  to  less  congestion  and  a  reduction  of  private  car
usage. Regulations can be put in place that improve the collection of water, the use of vehicles
and mandatory recycling to reduce the demand for waste disposal services. All these approaches
to expanding carrying capacity require careful planning and significant capital outlay.

Consideration  of  resources  and  infrastructural  and  environmental  carrying  capacity  must  also
take  account  of  the  fact  that  Barbados  has  a  transient  tourist  population  of  approximately
500,000 annually. There are also cultural dimensions to carrying capacity given concerns for

31

population  density,  the  association  of  large  families  with  poverty  and  the  strong  sense  of
Barbadian identity.

With these caveats and considerations, an incremental approach to population growth over the
period 2021-2050 which would contribute directly to meeting unmet labour force needs and bring
in added human resources, is recommended. This would include an increase the population in
the short-term in response to economic and labour force needs (migration), and an expansion of
the options of the population to make reproductive decisions towards child bearing with possible
impacts on increased fertility rates in the medium term.

While this Policy does not prescribe a number by which the population should be increased, it is
evident  that  the  phenomenon  of  an  ageing  and  eventually  declining  population  must  be
addressed as part of planning for the future.

The policy outlines three main approaches to increasing the population to meet the current and
future  development  goals.  The  first  is  through  managed  migration,  an  approach  targeted  at
increasing the population of working age persons in the short- and medium term. This approach
is recommended to meet immediate or projected labour force gaps to drive economic growth.
The  second  is  through  policies  that  promote  repatriation  of  Barbadians,  either  permanent,
temporarily  or  transitory.  The  third  is  through  supporting  pro-fertility,  reproductive  decision-
making through the strengthening of an enabling and supportive environment for families. This is
a longer-term strategy, the quantitative outcomes of which are unpredictable and uncertain given
the non-negotiability of women’s rights to decide the number and spacing of their children.

There  are  ways  in  which  population  growth  targets,  (immediately  through  the  promotion  of
immigration and longer-term through a combination of migration and increases in birth rates),
can be devised but with varying degrees of credibility.

One way would be based on the projection of what the size of the population would have been if
fertility rates were maintained at 2.1 and without any dramatic variation in the trends of death
or  migration  rates.  Under  these  circumstances  Barbados  would  have  a  population  of
approximately 400,000 by 2050, that is, a natural increase of approximately 185,000 people.12

Another way of arriving at a numerical target would be to calculate actual and projected labour
force needs which correspond to existing labour force gaps and to projections of the skills and
numbers of persons that could support the implementation of an industrial development plan.
These policy parameters are not currently available.

However setting and meeting such a numerical target based on labour force needs, and especially
for  short-  and  medium-term  growth  in  the  population  of  working  age,  has  some  urgency.
Attention should be given to the development of a migration policy informed by labour force and
social/human capital needs analyses and produced through inter-ministerial collaboration.

12 See Appendix 2 for population projections based the maintenance of fertility replacement rate since 1980..

32

One approach which is not recommended is to link population size in a linear manner to economic
growth and development. The potential impact whether beneficial, detrimental or non-existent,
between population growth and economic growth/development is a complex matter, which is
influenced  not  only  by  the  structure,  size  or  composition  of  a  country’s  population  but  other
factors including the social and economic history of the country and the surrounding region, the
structure and size of the economy, the stage of country’s development, its location in the global
political economy, and existing social and finance infrastructure and policies, particularly in the
areas of health, sanitation, education and governance.13

It is also possible to be guided by the population size of countries which have higher population
densities and higher GDP per capita than Barbados. This would include countries like Bermuda
and Singapore. But again, this would be simplistic, and any such number for targeted population
growth through managed migration could not withstand scrutiny. It should be noted that there
are countries with a lower population density than Barbados but with a higher GDP per capita
(Aruba, San Marino, Republic of Korea and the Netherlands).14 And there are many countries with
larger populations and very poor social and economic development indicators.

The  Population  Policy  recommends  an  incremental  approach  that  uses  the  projected
population size based on replacement rate as a starting point for annual targets over the next
10-15 years. The Policy also recommends the immediate development of a Managed Migration
Policy that would specify the skills and competencies which are needed in the labour force as well
as to drive desired and planned industrial development.

Elements informing the incremental approach include:

●  annual targets for migration informed by needed skill sets and the absorptive capacity of the

labour market;

●  availability of housing and needed social services;
●  maintenance  of  a  data  management  system  which  collects  data  on  migrants,  including
location of settlement, sectors of employment, numbers of accompanying family members;
and

●  periodic review and revision upwards or downwards of the migration targets based on the

above variables and on the economic climate and human and social capital needs.

Population  growth  through  migration  should  not  be  at  the  expense  or  displacement  of
employment (existing or prospective) for those already in Barbados and must be mindful of the
state fiscal limits to invest in infrastructural and social services adaptations to meet the needs of
rapid population increases in the short-term.

For long-term population stabilization, two main approaches are recommended for increasing the
population  size:  the  implementation  of  a  managed  migration  policy  to  attract  working  age
persons  into  Barbados  and  a  policy  that  enhances  family  wellbeing  to  support  reproductive

decision making for those who wish to have children.

Sub-goal 1.1 Increase the Population of Persons of Working Age

Given Barbados’ advanced stage of aging and below-replacement fertility, natural increases are
likely  to  be  negligible  or  non-existent.  Pro-population  growth  approaches  which  increase  the
proportion of persons of working age should:

  Extend the categories of persons entitled to citizenship and permanent residence;
  Retain and encourage repatriation of Barbadians and stem the brain drain; and
  Promote managed migration of persons who can bring capabilities and resources to invest in
the future of Barbados and to contribute to areas of the economy where there are unmet
labour and skills requirements.

Such  approaches  increase  the  likelihood  of  meeting  the  immediate  and  medium-term  unmet
labour  force  needs;  increasing  the  amount  of  persons  contributing  to  government  revenue
through direct and indirect taxation, contributing to the economic vibrancy and engaging in care
work in families and the community.

i.

Extending the categories of persons entitled to citizenship and permanent
residence

There are already approaches aimed at encouraging persons to live and work in Barbados. These
include  the  CARICOM  Single  Market  and  Economy  (CSME)  that  enables  CARICOM  nationals  in
specified categories to move and work freely within the region, contingent on certification. Under
the  CSME,  not  only  do  CARICOM  nationals  and  their  families  come  to  live  and  work,  but  also
Barbadians  are  similarly  unrestricted  in  moving  to  other  CARICOM  countries.  Barbados  is  the
number one destination country under CSME, having received the most CARICOM nationals.15

This  policy  should  be  extended  to  allow  free  movement  of  all  persons  from  CARICOM,  as  is
planned by CARICOM.

Draft  legislation  under  consideration  seeks  to  expand  the  categories  of  those  entitled  to
citizenship as follows:

●  persons born outside Barbados, if either one of their grandparents or great-grandparents is

or was a Citizen of Barbados, whether by birth, descent, naturalization or otherwise;

●  persons who are permanent residents and have resided in Barbados for a total of 1,095 days

during the last 6 years immediately preceding the date of application;

●  a person who is an immigrant and has been an immigrant for a period exceeding 3 years;
●  a national (and their dependents and spouse) of a CARICOM member state who has resided

15 IOM: Free Movement of Persons in the Caribbean: Economic and Security Dimensions. 2019

34

in Barbados for at least 5 years; and

●  a  person  (and  spouse  and  dependents)  who  not  being  nationals  of  CARICOM  has  been

resident in Barbados for 6 years.

Likewise,  the  Immigration  Bill  provides  administrative  pathways  to  permanent  residence  to
expanded categories of persons:

●  a child of a person who is a permanent resident of Barbados and residing in Barbados;
●  a person who by reason of his age, education, experience, financial resources and skills is not
a  citizen  or  permanent  resident  of  Barbados  and  can  establish  himself  economically  in
Barbados.

These proposed legislative reforms which expand the categories of persons eligible for citizenship
and permanent residence, also make provisions for administrative processes that should reduce
processing time for the granting of the applied status.

The Commission recommends that these Bills be reviewed and enacted, but subject to further
consideration  of  terms of  eligibility to  cost-free  access  to  education and  health  care based  on
certain  requirements  such  as  period  of  residence,  tax  contributions  or  investments.  This  is  to
mitigate uptake of citizenship for purposes of access to services without contributions through
taxation.

Temporary Residence: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the government introduced the Barbados
Welcome Stamp Programme which facilitated the temporary relocation for persons who wished
to work remotely from Barbados. This should be continued.

ii.

Retaining and repatriating Barbadians

It  is  estimated  that  the  number  of  Barbadians  living  abroad  totals  almost  30  percent  of  the
domestic resident population. Traditional migration pathways to North Atlantic countries have
been associated with higher incomes, expanded occupational opportunities, social security and a
better quality of life. Emigration represents brain and skills drain even while it also represents a
source  of  remittances  and  opportunities  for  Barbadians  within  and  outside  Barbados.  Still,
Barbados ought to be the home that its people want to return to after studying or having living
experiences outside of its borders.

While  recognising  that  mobility  across  borders  is  a  feature  of  Barbadian  culture  and  of
globalisation, the underlying factors that drive out-migration efforts must be addressed. Policy
approaches to expand economic and labour opportunities, and strengthen social cohesion and
security include:

increased access to affordable land for productive uses;

●
●  education reform that responds to and values the diversity of capacities needed in the

society and economy;

35

●

●

improved delivery of public services to support private sector development and job
creation;
increased productivity in high-skilled occupations, many of which are in the public sector;
and

●  tax concessions for the initial years of employment.

 Repatriation

Barbadians  who  live  elsewhere  should  be  encouraged  to  return,  either  for  periods  of  time  or
permanently. Returning provides opportunities to give back through engagement in the labour
force and through community engagement.

While there are complex push and pull factors that inform decisions to leave, remain or return,
there are some measures that can facilitate the decision making to repatriate. These include:

●  ready availability of information on social security and health care entitlements;

accommodation/housing;
job opportunities and education for children;

●
●  continued untaxed import of vehicles and other belongings, and the granting of a residence

permit and citizenship to family members;

●  access to affordable land and housing;
●  reduced bureaucracy to the establishment of new businesses; and
●  creation and subsidisation of innovation laboratories for youth entrepreneurs.

 Partial Repatriation

In the world of increased connectivity and mobility, drawing on the lessons from the Barbados
Welcome  Stamp  Programme  (remote  work  programme),  Barbadians  abroad  can  also  be
encouraged to contribute actively and/or to see Barbados as a co- location for work and life. This
would  not  require  a  complete  repatriation  but  allow  them  to  maintain  the  benefits  of  their
migratory country as well as benefits of a closer association, physical or virtual, to Barbados.

Approaches that may facilitate periodic relocation and contribution include:

●  development of a structured give back/pay forward scheme through which Barbadians in the

diaspora can maintain connectivity and contribution to Barbados’ social development;

●  easy accessibility of school places for children;
●  affordable housing;
●  establishment and marketing of linkages between the diaspora community and professional

institutions for volunteering and participation; and

●  tax incentives, e.g., duty free concessions or VAT exemptions for specified periods.

36

iii.

Managed Migration

Ordinarily, managed migration policies support economic and labour market objectives. They are
driven by labour market needs, derived from an understanding of over and under supply of labour
as well as an identification of projected growth within and between industrial sectors.

Managed migration policies address temporary and permanent labour migration. They seek to
attract  skilled  individuals  that  drive  economic  growth  and  innovation  and  can  be  informed  by
considerations such as vocational preparation, occupational demand and arranged employment.
Otherwise, the migrant policy can be informed by a human capital focus that places emphasis on
factors such as age, language proficiency, skills and education and is largely supply driven.

There  are  both  opportunities  and  costs  associated  with  labour  migration  programmes.
Immigration can exacerbate socio-economic inequalities. As a component of a population policy,
the efficiency and productivity gains of managed migration must be closely considered along with
the distributional impact and dislocation that migration flows might generate.

Given the declining population of working age, a multi-sectoral managed migration policy should
be developed with the objective of increasing the size and expertise of the working age population
as a short and medium-term approach to the consequences of an aging and declining population.
The scale of managed migration is obviously context specific and the target for Barbados has to
be set through considerations of labour force and human capital needs.

Such a policy should promote Barbados as a desirable location to live and work for people who
can bring capabilities and resources to invest in the future of Barbados and to contribute to areas
of the economy where there are unmet labour and skills requirements.

It should speak to sectors that are or could be drivers of growth and for which new or added skills
are needed. Sectors identified as the key drivers of growth include heritage tourism, renewable
ICT,  electricity,  energy,  graphic  design  and  animation,  software  development,  specialty  rum,
pharmaceuticals  and  biotech  products.16  A  managed  migration  policy  should  be  based  on
assessment of whether the needed skills to grow these sectors are available in Barbados, can be
developed in the short to medium term and/or should be augmented by migration.

The  implementation  of  such  a  migration  policy  should  be  closely  monitored  to  ensure  that
migrants are integrated in a fair manner and that Barbadians are not displaced from the labour
market or otherwise disadvantaged.

Such a policy should allow for migrants arriving with family members and ensure access to health
and education for minors as well as to work permits for partners. At the same time, care and

16 The Ministry of Labour, Social Security and Third Sector (MLSP) in collaboration with the Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB): The ‘Roadmap for Identifying Strategic Growth Sectors in Barbados Project, 2023

37

attention  ought  to  be  placed  on  making  allowances  for  the  implications  associated  with  the
increased demand for a variety of age-determined services and use of infrastructure.

The managed migration policy should specify short and medium-term targets for increasing the
working age population which can be adjusted, having regard to the changing economic, social
and cultural profile of the country, and its developmental objectives and opportunities, and based
on continuous assessment of the impact of migration.

In summary, a managed migration policy should:

●  Be  informed  by  an  industrial  policy  and  based  on  a  robust  migration  and  labour  market
information systems. Such systems would provide a systemic basis for evaluating the demand
for and supply of labour by sector.

●  Remove obstacles associated with immigration protocols/initiatives that are likely to inhibit

prospective investment and labour services.

●  Review  bureaucratic  requirements  for  the  timely  granting  of  CSME  skilled  national

certification.

●  Secure migrant integration through policies that support:

o  Labour force mobility
o  Pathways to citizenship or permanent residence
o  Family reunion
o  Access to affordable health care and education by accompanying family members
o  Access to financial services

●  Promote  dialogue  and  interaction  with  Barbadians  to  facilitate  integration  and  multi-

culturalism while securing and advancing Barbadian cultural identity and values.

●  Devise data collection systems to monitor changes in population distribution due to managed
migration and analyse the implications of such changes, on, for example, demands for social
services, education and health services, infrastructure, and security.

Such a policy is multi-sectoral, responding to considerations of the labour force, infrastructure,
transportation,  access  to  services,  industrial  policy.  The  development,  implementation  and
monitoring of such a policy should be undertaken by an inter-ministerial team.

Sub-Goal 1. 2: Enhance Family Wellbeing to Support Reproductive Decision Making

One long term approach to increasing population size is through supporting reproductive decision
making of people who wish to have children. For those who wish to have children, policies should
address the impediments or barriers to childbearing.

In addition to deliberate decision making on the timing, number and spacing of children, reduced
fertility is also associated with limitations in the supporting environment for those who may want
children.  Poverty,
inadequate  workplace  policies,  time
constraints and the absence of social support are factors informing the decision against

inadequate  childcare  resources,

38

childbearing. The gender division of labour may also act as a barrier to childbearing given that
women continue to carry an unequal care burden for children and the elderly.

The  Population  Policy  recommends  a  framework  to  support  reproductive  decision  making
consistent with human rights, and in particular women’s unfettered rights to reproductive self-
determination  to  decide  on  the  number  and  spacing  of  children.  This  framework  should  also
respond to the barriers to childbearing for those who would like children and/or are considering
their options.

The objectives within this goal are:

●  To reduce the structural barriers to childbearing and support fertility decision-making
●  To ensure non-discriminatory and age-appropriate access to sexual and reproductive

information, and services across the life cycle.

Reducing Barriers to Fertility

Policy prescriptions must respect women’s rights to make decisions regarding the number, timing
and spacing of children. The state is obligated to ensure that people, and in particular women,
have access to reproductive information, services: including affordable contraception, and safe
and non- stigmatized termination of pregnancy.

In addition, the state should also address the barriers to childbearing. These barriers include the
disproportionate  care
insufficiency,
inadequate/insufficient  childcare  facilities,  inadequate  workplace  accommodation  for  parents
and fertility constraints.

for  children  on  women,

responsibility

income

The responsibility for the care of children, while primarily the role of families, also must be borne
by the state through the provision  of day care facilities and cash transfers for low-income and
middle-income households. Within families and between parents a more equitable contribution
to the financial, physical and emotional care must be nurtured. Recognizing the diversity of family
forms, family wellbeing must be promoted and is linked to positive child and youth development,
gender equal culture, community solidarity, a caring and empathetic citizenry and a productive
and engaged labour force.

Actions to reduce the structural barriers to childbearing and support fertility decision-making.
include the following components:

Social Protection and Social Services

●  Child benefit subsidies especially for low- and middle-income single parents
●  Provision of free or highly subsidized quality childcare, especially for children below the age

of 3

●  Subsidized housing for low-income single parent households

39

●  Tax concessions for families with dependent children
●  Subsidies for childcare materials
●  Building on existing initiatives such as PAREDOS, develop a case management approach to

support parents and families for social care support.

●  Ensure the implementation of a gender-responsive child support legal framework.
●  Provide community counselling centres to support parents.

Social Norms Changes

●  Promoting equal sharing of unpaid care work between women and men.
●  Use school-based approaches to address restrictive gender roles, relations and stereotypes.

Labour Force Measures

●  Strengthened parental protection legislative scheme.
●  Provisions for longer periods of maternity leave, depending on the number of children under

school going age in the household.

●  Establish paternity leave and shared parental leave measures.
●  Promote flexible working arrangements. This includes part-time work, compressed work

weeks, tele-commuting and working from home, alternative office spaces and job-sharing.

Access to Health Care

●  Ensure access to affordable fertility assessments and treatments for women and men.
●

Increase  education  and  training  for  health  care  providers  regarding  fertility  preservation,
infertility diagnosis, safety and effectiveness of infertility treatment options and referral to
providers of infertility care.

Complementary to removing structural barriers to fertility, children and young adults should have
access to science-based, non-discriminatory sexual and reproductive education and services. To
address  adolescent  fertility  and  teenage  parenting,  age-appropriate  comprehensive  life  skills
education  should  be  a  part  of  the  school  curriculum.  This  curriculum  should  emphasize  the
principles of full bodily autonomy, that is, the right to make choices, respect for self and others
and provide accurate information about human development, anatomy and reproductive health.
Such  an  approach  should  equip  youth  with  the  knowledge  required  to  make  sexual  and
reproductive decisions responsibly, keeping them protected from coercion, sexually transmitted
infections and unintended pregnancy.

Non-discriminatory and age-appropriate access to sexual and reproductive information and
services should be ensured through:

●  age-appropriate  and  non-discriminatory  comprehensive  life  skills  education  in  schools

consistent with the developing capacities of young people; and

●  access to sexual and reproductive services, including for adolescents and youth.

40

Policy Goal 2: Provide Barbadians and Non-Nationals Now and in the Future with
Opportunities for Personal Development

While there is a need to respond to the projected impacts of population decline, including through
the encouragement of in-migration, a primary concern of the policy is that in its implementation,
those who call Barbados home now and in the future are assured of a decent quality of life and
have opportunities for self and community development.

Sub-goal 2.1: Promote and Strengthen the Care Economy across the Lifecycle and for
the Vulnerable Population

People who are vulnerable because of age, infirmity and/or disability must be assured of dignified
lives  through  the  provision  of  material,  physical,  social  and  psychological  care.  This  multi-
dimensional care should be shared within families and between families and state institutions.

The  provision  of  quality  care  is  essential  for  the  reproduction  of  a  well-adjusted  and  socially
engaged society. It is the part of human activity that contributes to the wellbeing of the present
and  future  labour  force  and  the  population.  Care  has  material,  social,  physical  and  emotional
dimensions.  It  is  done  by  the  state  through  health,  education  and  social  service  institutions.
However, daily and nurturing care is largely the responsibility of families. Within families, people,
and  especially  persons  dependent  or  vulnerable  because  of  age  or  infirmity,  are  assured  food
security, shelter, clothing and emotional health.

Social care is also a very gendered experience. While both women and men have been historically
engaged in labour outside the home, the division of labour ascribes to women the role of primary
family caretakers, though increasingly more men are engaging actively in the care of children. This
care work is generally undervalued and rendered invisible. Because of this traditional division of
labour,  many  women  of  working  age  have  a  triple  responsibility;  not  only  do  they  have  to  be
economic providers, but they must also provide care (in all its components) for their children and
their parents. Women also are the main providers of care for persons with short- term or with
chronic sicknesses and/or disabilities. They do so even while many are in the lowest paid sectors
of the economy.

Yet social protection schemes do not recognize this care economy and there are no provisions
made within pension schemes, especially for those whose main work has been in the domestic
sphere. The care economy must be made visible; it must be recognised, reduced and redistributed
through  the  sharing  of  responsibilities.  The  value  of  reciprocity  and  inter-generational
dependence must be recognized as a core national value.

Elderly Care and Participation

Many of the elderly suffer from chronic illnesses and families may be hard pressed over the long
haul to provide quality care. They may also live alone and are outside of circles of care. This is

41

especially the case for elderly men who are more likely than women to be isolated from their
families, having not been involved in the care of the children. Given the shrinking size of families
and  low  fertility  rates,  the  care  responsibilities  are  increasingly  concentrated  on  few  persons
within nuclear-type families.

Family caregiving over a prolonged period can be stressful, especially for those family members
who are not trained. Care givers can be challenged to provide the level of quality care required
by those who are dependent on them because of income insufficiency, anxiety and competing
claims on time especially if employed or with caring responsibilities for young children. Supporting
family  care  is  therefore  essential  given  the  growth  of  the  aging  population  with  NCDs.  That
support  is  not  only  advantageous  to  the  care  givers,  but  to  the  care  recipients  and  for  public
systems.  State  systems  to  support  the  primary  caretakers  of  the  elderly,  persons  living  with
chronic diseases and the young must be addressed.

Equally, it is important to acknowledge the diversity of capacities of vulnerable populations and
not  assume  the  need  for  only  care.  People  live  longer  lives  and  wish  to  continue  to  make
contributions to society but may be sidelined and excluded because of stereotypes about aging
and disability status. In addition to the provision of high quality and accessible care, the Policy
affirms active aging and recommends the integration and participation of older persons in public
life.

This  integration  should  be  enabled  through  encouragement  of  economic,  political,  social  and
cultural  participation  in  public  life,  through  accessible  and  affordable  infrastructure  (housing,
transportation)  and  integration  in  community  life  and  the  promotion  of  intergenerational
relationships.

The following approaches are recommended with the objective of promoting the valuing and non-
discriminatory sharing of care work in families, households and communities:

●  Recognise the full-time and/or part-time domestic care contributions in pension schemes

within the National Insurance Scheme.

●  Promote workplace practices that support caregiving responsibilities.
●  Support in-home caretaking through the provision of trained and remunerated caretakers.
●  Provide tax breaks or provide cash grants for low-income caregivers who, within the confines

of their private household, provide care for elderly persons or other dependents.

●  Establish support groups and counselling programmes for caregivers.
●  Promote family-friendly policies in the workplace for those caring for elderly family members

(including flexible work schedules and telecommuting).

Elderly Care Recommendations:

●  Review and adopt the draft National Policy on Aging which addresses caregiving and its

integration and participation.

●  Review the functioning of residential institutions and strengthen protocols for care facilities.

42

●  Work with civil society community-based organisations to promote social circles for exercise,

recreation and interaction.

●  Encourage ‘on the job’ intergenerational mentorships.
●  Ensure transportation affordability and accessibility to encourage mobility across the life cycle

and different abilities.

●  Reduce taxes on commodities for the elderly.

Sub-goal 2.2: Expand Access to Quality Health Care and Wellness Service Interventions

The health and wellness sectors are oriented to meeting the needs of people across the life cycle.
Of  particular  focus  considering  the  population  trends,  is  the  need  for  targeted  approaches  to
address the long- term care needs of a growing elderly population though not overlooking the
needs of specific populations such as those with disabilities, children and young persons.

Respect  for  autonomy  and  the  patient’s personal  values  must  be  considered  in  health-related
decision-making, with people having access to the relevant information to make informed choices
related to health care interventions, including the nature of care (e.g., palliative) and the timeline
for interventions.

Health education and services must continue to promote wellness through healthier nutritional
practices as well as greater levels of physical activity, across the life cycle for NCD prevention. To
support  this,  facilities  for  exercise  must  be  appropriate  for  all  ages  and  abilities.  Actions  to
strengthen disease prevention and control across the life cycle should include the following:

●

Increased training and capacity of health professionals in prevention, primary care, early
rehabilitative care, gerontology, dentistry and other needed specialist and allied health areas.

●  Reinforcement of health and wellness clinics with specific focus on:

o  women’s health and wellness;
o  support and self-management of treatment regimens; and
o  men’s health and wellness.

●  Use policy measures such as taxation as incentives to influence and promote healthy nutrition,
including  consumption  of  locally produced  food (e.g., increase  taxes  on  food  items high  in
sugar, salt and trans-fats, as well as ultra-processed foods while subsidizing nutritious food
options)
Increase availability of land and support agricultural practices that increase the supply of local
fruits and vegetables.
Improve physical infrastructure that is conducive to greater levels of participation in physical
activities across the life cycle.

●

●

In addition to the potential impact of such measures in strengthening the health and social well-
being  of  resident  populations  in  Barbados,  they  also  contribute  overwhelmingly  to  promoting
lifestyle  practices  consistent  with  a  model  of  disease  prevention,  especially  those  classified  as
chronic, non-communicable diseases (NCDs).

43

At community levels, infrastructural development should consider the spatial requirements that
support participation in public spaces, mobility and recreational needs of aging populations and
people living with disabilities. To this end, the following strategies are proffered:

●  Develop and encourage safe social spaces at the community level that are also responsive to
the mobility and recreational needs of specific populations including the elderly and persons
living with disabilities, and which provide opportunities for intergenerational interactions at
community levels.

●  Ensure  that  all  private  and  public  buildings  and  facilities  make  provision  to  incorporate

measures that permit ease of access and mobility for persons with disabilities.

Sub-goal 2.3: Improve the Capacity and Proficiency of the Labour Force with Access to
Expanded Opportunities

To attain sustainable socioeconomic development, measures must be pursued that will bolster
employment  opportunities  in  a  diversified  economy,  especially  for  the  youth,  while  removing
limitations  on  those  who  wish  to  continue  in  the  labour  market  beyond  what  is  now  the
retirement age.

The  economic  impacts  of  COVID  -19  and  the  associated  disruption  of  the  tourism  industry
reinforce the need for a more diversified economy with attention to growing other productive
sectors that generate national income and employment.

In  promoting  diversification,  attention  must  be  given  to  alignment  between  education  and
training  opportunities  at  the  tertiary  level  and  prospective  and  emerging  productive  sectors,
whether  in  services,  the  industrial  and  energy  sectors,  agriculture  or  information  technology.
Specific growth sectors identified for the county over the next 10 to 15 years include: heritage
tourism, renewable energy, graphic design and animation, software development, specialty rum,
pharmaceuticals, and biotech products17. In addition, a Labour Market Information System can
support that alignment between education and training and labour market needs.

In Barbados, high proportions of youth populations continue to be not in employment, education,
or training (NEET). Early and long periods out of school and the productive sectors of the society
and  the  economy  for  youth,  and  in  particular  young  men,  is  associated  with  disaffection  and
participation in subcultures marked by substance abuse and criminal activity. This is especially so
for youth who come from fragmented families and disadvantaged communities.

Ensuring that young people leave the education system with self-esteem, accomplishments,

17 Comment from Ministry of Labour, Social Security and Third Sector in relation to recent studies:
Roadmap for Identifying Strategic Growth Sectors in Barbados Project, Skills for the Future Project
and the 2022 BERT/BEST Programme of the Government of Barbados.

44

capabilities and a sense of purpose within their communities is critical to their engagement in the
economy in ways that contribute to the society and further their personal development goals.

Increasing labour force participation therefore is best attainable if the foundations for self-esteem
and  personal  drive  are  secured  in  primary  and  secondary  schools  and  in  post-secondary
institutions, and young people are prepared to participate in the labour market and empowered
and  supported  to  innovate  and  create.  Education  reform  is  needed  to  expand  from  the  post-
colonial  preoccupation  with  certification  at  all  stages  of  schooling,  and  re-oriented  to  foster
confidence, critical thinking, empathy and life skills needed for flexibility and resilience. Young
people should be better prepared for the world of work and community participation through the
development of a diversity of capabilities and interests.

Entrepreneurial ventures have increasingly been encouraged in Barbados. Pre-COVID-19 data on
the labour force characteristics in Barbados has shown that more men than women were self-
employed,  and  that  self-employment  was  gaining  prominence  as  a  means  of  engaging  male
workers in the labour market.

Labour  market  policy  is  needed  to  address  the  challenges  associated  with  labour  force
precariousness especially for youth, women, people living with disabilities and those categorized
as elderly who desire to remain active in the economy beyond the age of retirement. There also
needs to be provision for reducing stereotyping and discrimination predicated upon age, gender,
disability  status  and  citizenship.  In  this  vein,  any  strategies  to  emanate  from  a  labour  market
policy, and indeed the population policy, should be cognizant of other existing initiatives, or those
under development, such as the National Policy for Persons with Disabilities.

In addition to ensuring that youth are actively and constructively engaged in the labour force and
their communities, the Policy promotes the active and voluntary engagement of elderly persons
in the economy. Persons over the age of 67 (the current retirement age) should have the option
of continued employment though this would have to be balanced against the employment needs
of  youth  and  would  also  depend  on  the  sector  of  employment  and  the  implications  for  the
National Insurance Scheme.

The following policy strategies are recommended:

Education sector

●  Review  and  improve  curricula  and  teaching  methods  in  primary,  secondary  and  tertiary
education  as  they  relate  to  science,  technology,  engineering  and  mathematics  (STEM)
subjects.

●  Review  and  improve  curricula  and  teaching  methods  in  secondary,  post-secondary  and
tertiary  education  to  inculcate  innovation,  entrepreneurial  behaviour  and  issues  related to
the acquisition of soft skills (conflict resolution, leadership, communication, inter- personal
skills etc.) financial literacy and job-seeking skills.

●  Any review  should be accompanied by relevant accreditation  (e.g.,  Barbados Accreditation

45

Council) to ensure international acceptance to the benefit of current student retention and
attraction of external students.

Technical and vocational training

●  Enhance skill sets of the current workforce to meet the demands of new jobs in emergent
industries  (heritage  tourism,  renewable  energy,  graphic  design  and  animation,  software
development, specialty rum, pharmaceuticals, and biotech products).

●  Provide  opportunities  for  structured  arrangements  that  would  permit  qualification  and
certification for persons providing care services in the home, whether serving the needs of
children, the elderly or the disabled.

●  Promote technical and vocational education and training (TVET) and the implementation of a
dual-track TVET system where institutional instruction is complemented by practical work and
experience. This can be facilitated through the implementation of the Barbados Qualifications
and Credit Framework (BQCF) to be operationalised by the Barbados Accreditation Council. 18

Partnerships

●  Dissemination of information on employment and education/training opportunities for NEET
youth  by  relevant  government  agencies  including  through  families,  community-based
organizations, faith-based organizations and labour unions as gateways to NEET youth.

●  Encourage investment in training in both the private and public sectors especially with respect
to improving the quality of vocational training with a heavy emphasis on the acquisition of
digital skills.
Implement  incentives  for  industry-academia  linkages  to  enhance  collaborative  capacities
across industry and academia. This allows for greater matching of the supply and demand for
skills.

●

●  Encourage investment and partnership agreements that will foster participation in research
and  development  initiatives  involving  the  public  sector,  the  business  community  and
academia.

●  Commission  dedicated  ministries  and  research  support  centres  and  science  councils  to

provide for a one-stop-shop for innovators.

Regulatory and Administrative Processes

●  Review the mandatory age of retirement to provide choice to persons who wish to and can

continue employment.

●  Promote an agenda consistent with the attainment of decent work in keeping with ILO’s

Decent Work protocols.

●  Continue development of labour market data systems and development of institutional

Policy Goal 3: Promote Integrated Settlement Development and Safeguard the Ecological
Balance

Sub-goal 3.1: Reconcile Population Redistribution, Land Use and Settlement Patterns

Notwithstanding the stabilization in population growth, there has been a significant increase in
the conversion of agricultural land to fulfil residential and commercial purposes. That along with
the diversion from traditional food production practices has increased the country’s dependence
on food imports, which has negative implications for food security and national health outcomes.

Bridgetown and communities in the greater Bridgetown area are threatened by urban decay due
to sub-urbanization. Reinvestment in Bridgetown and surrounding older urban areas is needed to
repurpose vacant and derelict properties to productive use.

Traffic  congestion  in  and  around  the  Greater  Bridgetown  area  is  an  ongoing  problem.  Such
congestion is primarily due to decentralization of residential areas. Despite having expanded the
island’s development footprint by 60 percent and almost doubling the number of cars over the
last  two  decades,  there  has  been  little  expansion  in  transport  infrastructure  capacity.  The
transportation network of highways and roads is fundamentally the same as it was dating back to
the 1990s.

To  date,  Barbados  is  the  only  CARICOM  member  state  with  a  government  approved  national
Physical Development Plan (PDP) as an integrated framework to guide the physical development
of  the  country  and  support  the  continued  health  and  prosperity  of  its  citizens.  The  current
Barbados Physical Development Plan offers detailed policy guidelines that are endorsed in this
Population Policy. It seeks  inter alia to promote the efficient use of land and services through
compact, contiguous and mixed-use development through:

●  Protection of community cores, namely, the commercial, residential and cultural heart and
central  places  of  Barbados,  providing  the  densest  concentration  of  people,  buildings,  and
activities.  The  community  cores  of  Bridgetown,  Speightstown,  Oistins,  Holetown,  Six  Cross
Roads, Warrens, Wildey, Belleplaine and Bathsheba are identified in the Community Plans of
the NDP. Each core is defined in a place-specific manner, and policies to encourage vibrant,
walkable and prosperous cores are tailored to the distinct possibilities of that community.

●  Encouragement of higher density residential development within the Urban Corridor.
●  Promotion of the designation of Predominantly Residential Areas to be areas located within
the  Urban  Corridor,  Stable  Suburban  Areas  and  National  Park Villages, and  intended  to  be
developed as compact and complete communities.

The PDP also encourages the design and development of compact, well-connected and complete
communities through:

●  Encouragement of major development facilities and essential services infrastructure (health-
related,  police  stations,  post  offices,  libraries,  community  centres)  in  Regional  and  Local

48

Centres or near other central community facilities and considering the distribution of such
facilities based on population service areas rather than on the parish system;

●  Review of school locations to ensure proximity to urban settlement areas and well serviced
by  transportation  options  and  to  respond  to  rising  or  falling  populations  of  school  age
children.
Incorporate adaptive reuse of public and heritage buildings;

●
●  Designation of an extensive area outside of the Urban Corridor and National Park as a Working
Landscape  for  the  harmonious  co-existence  and  management  of  agricultural  production,
renewable energy initiatives, resource extraction, solid waste management and a mixture of
essential infrastructural services.

●  Review transport routes based on population changes and commuting patterns and ensure
access for all to safe, age and gender responsive, affordable, accessible and sustainable urban
mobility and sea transport systems;

●  Promotion  and  incentivization  of  transit  use  and  active  transport  while  dis-incentivizing
private  automobile  usage,  including  through  transport  terminals,  park  and  ride  transfer
points, rendezvous for car-pooling and bus transfer points.
Institution of the requirement for EIAs and SIAs for any significant expansion of existing or
development of new sporting complexes or similar facilities dedicated to serving communities
or the national public.

●

Sub-goal 3.2: Ensure the Efficient Management of Natural Resources and the Environment

The  demand  for  water  is  influenced  by  urban  sprawl,  needed  and/or  anticipated  increases  in
agricultural  production  and  transient  tourist  populations.  Yet  Barbados  suffers  from  water
scarcity that is related to climate change due principally to higher temperatures and the increased
intensity  of  droughts  and  variability  of  rainfall  events.  Barbados’  aged  water  distribution
infrastructure is strained by increased water consumption. Changes in population distribution and
housing stock must consider supply and demand for water resources and so, significant attention
must be given to water conservation, capture, distribution and efficient water use.

In Barbados, agricultural production (produce and livestock) has declined significantly, and the
fishing industry has  suffered  a  two  percent  decline  from  overfishing  and  climate  change  since
2000  despite  various  policy  reforms  and  interventions.  Food  importation  accounts  for
approximately one quarter of all imports and 80 percent of all food consumed is imported. In
2020,  Barbados had  a food  import bill  of  more than  BBD$  664.7 million.  Actions  to  safeguard
ecological  balance  must  be  informed  by  an  understanding  of  the  interactions  and  linkages
livelihoods  and  environmental
between  agriculture,  trade,  health  and  nutrition,  rural
sustainability.

Most of the population of Barbados (66 percent in 2010) resides along the “urban corridor” within
two kilometres of the coastline. As a result, the island’s population is vulnerable to sea level rise
and  adverse  weather  systems  such  as  hurricanes.  The  concentration  of  population  and
infrastructure in and near coastal zones has also degraded marine habitats with land-based

49

activities being a major contributor to the deterioration of marine ecosystems. The coral reefs
provide protection to the fishing ecosystem and against beach erosion. The destruction of this
natural habitat therefore is not only environmentally catastrophic but also can negatively affect
economic activity in the tourism sector. This reality underpins the importance of strong coastal
zone management, including the establishment of marine protected areas, sustainable tourism
practices, and initiatives to promote coral reef conservation and restoration.

Urban and residential infrastructure development and higher levels of consumption increase the
generation of waste and demand for improved waste management. Between 1949 and 2015, the
amount of waste recorded entering the Mangrove Pond landfill has increased from 45 tonnes per
day to approximately 1000 tonnes per day. Since 2005, national waste diversion and management
strategies have effectively reduced the quantity of waste entering the landfill. However, increased
population coupled with expanding residential and urban areas will result in an increased burden
on  municipal  waste  collection.  This  may  inadvertently  cause  illegal  dumping  and  waste
stockpiling, negatively impacting human and environmental health.

To strengthen an integrated decision-making framework for development initiatives to safeguard
our  essential  ecosystem  services  and  reduce  vulnerability  to  natural  hazards,  the  following
recommendations are made:

●  Encourage Integrated Water Resource Management approaches and water efficient systems
in community development plans as well as public, private and household building design.
●  Strengthen  the  protection  of  water  resources  alongside  economic  development  and
population  expansion  through  integrated  water  use  and  supply  plans  for  proposed
developments.

●  Encourage  new  development,  as  well  as  institutional,  community  facilities  and  national
infrastructure projects outside of Natural Hazard Areas. Strengthen regulations, monitoring
and  enforcement  for  pollution  control  as  it  relates  to  water pollution,  illegal  dumping  and
habitat disruption.

●  Encourage  the  inclusion  of  design  measures  for  climate  change  resiliency  that  must  be

incorporated into site plans for new facilities.

●  Ensure  that  environmental,  legal,  economic  and  social  tenets  of  Barbados’  Sustainable
Development Policy are considered in the management of population structure and size as
well as any population development strategies.

●  Ensure that economic and social valuation tools and methodologies are incorporated into the
decision-making process of natural resource use and population development strategies.

Sub-goal 3.3: Strengthen Collective Resilience to the Impacts of a Changing Climate

Barbados and other small island developing states remain the most vulnerable countries in the
world to climate change. This is the case even though collectively small island states contribute
less than 1% to global greenhouse gas emissions that ultimately cause climate change.

Barbados  is  highly  vulnerable  to  hurricanes  and  other  natural  hazards  and  is  particularly
susceptible to the potential impacts of climate change, including coastal inundation and sea level
rise, an increase in tidal and storm surge levels, coastal erosion, rising temperatures, changes in
rainfall patterns, drought and more frequent and intense tropical cyclones.

Analyses of regional climate models and projections suggest that ongoing global climatic changes
have largely contributed to an average of nearly 5 to 20 per cent decline in seasonal rainfall in the
Caribbean. Alongside the devastation that disasters continue to inflict on people in the region,
countries are also grappling with coastal inundation and saltwater intrusion due to sea level rise
estimated at 1.4 to 3.4 mm per annum.19

Efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius are imperative. Studies show that
the difference between 1.5 degrees and 2 degrees Celsius, the threshold called for in the Paris
Agreement,  would  mean  10-centimeter  higher  global  sea-level  rise  by  the  start  of  the  next
century, longer heat waves, and would put virtually all tropical coral reefs at risk of dying off.

Coral reefs and other coastal ecosystems play a vital role in shoreline protection, beach creation,
fish  nurseries,  recreational  activities  and  education  and  training  among  other  things.20  This
temperature increase has had considerable heat stress impacts on marine and terrestrial species
populations.  Humans  can  also  be  affected  by  these  increased  temperatures,  and  vulnerable
communities such as those within an aging demographic may be especially susceptible to health
impacts because of heat stress.

Further to the biophysical and social impacts, high-energy climatic events have had disastrous
effects on island economies in the Caribbean. Countries have experienced over 200% losses in
GDP  from  just  one  hurricane21.  These  GDP  losses  are  then  compounded  by  further  losses  in
employment, public health expenditure, food production capacity, education system efficiency
and  natural  ecosystem  productivity.  This  vulnerability  and  combination  of  multi-dimensional
impacts can be considered a threat to national security.

Barbados has begun to implement adaptation measures to address climate impacts and build a
resilient  society  while  demonstrating  a  commitment  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by
transitioning to a low-carbon economy by 2030. Key policy instruments in use with integrated
approaches to reduce the impacts of climate changes include the Barbados Physical Development
Plan, the Draft Integrated Coastal Zone Management Plan (2020-2030) and the Government’s
model integrated development framework represented in the Roofs to Reefs Programme.

To secure climate resilient development across all sectors and levels of governance, the following
should be undertaken:

●  Promote forward planning through the utilisation of the national, regional and community
physical  development  plans  to  integrate  climate  change  as  a  cross-cutting  consideration
across all components of land use planning, natural resources management and development
management.
Introduce  ecosystem-based  interventions  combined  with  existing  strategies  to  improve
ecosystem health, address climate change and known coastal hazards.

●

●  Strengthen governance and partnerships between the public sector, private organisations and
non- governmental organisations to harness scarce resources and build capacity to combat
the effects of climate change and the wider spectrum of disaster risk management activities.
●  Encourage the inclusion of design measures for climate change adaptation and resiliency that

must be incorporated into site plans for new facilities.
Improve technical capacity and sustainable livelihoods in climate resilience.

●
●  Promote  regeneration  and  conservation  practices  wherever  possible  to  ensure  the

●

preservation and improvement of natural habitats.
Implement  risk  resilient  integrated  coastal  zone  management  to  safeguard  livelihoods,
investments and natural ecosystems in the face of a range of coastal hazards including climate
change.

●  Encourage  investment  into  climate  resilience  and  habitat  regeneration  projects  by  new

●

infrastructural and economic development initiatives.
Increase  the  overall  health  and resiliency of natural  habitats  and  avoid the degradation of
ecosystems which support livelihoods and infrastructure.

●  Encourage  energy  efficient  technologies  and  the  use  of  renewable  energy  generation

elements for all new infrastructure developments.

52

53

 Implementation Framework

The Population Policy is cross-sectoral and its implementation will depend on the engagement of
the  Government,  social  partners,  civil  society  actors,  trade  unions,  private  sector  and
communities.  It  should  be  accompanied  by  a  plan  of  action  developed  by  an  Inter-sectoral
Implementation Group (ISIG) that is accountable and reporting to the National Strategic Council.

The Plan of Action should be the framework for the design, financing, monitoring and evaluation,
collaboration and coordination of the Plan. It should identify responsible and lead agencies for
the  implementation  of the  goals  and  sub-goals. The  plan  of  action  should  contain time-bound
commitments and be adequately resourced to ensure accountability for implementation. The ISIG
should constitute a sub-committee to develop the managed migration policy.

This ISIG should be chaired by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, with thematic sub-committees
co-chaired by relevant line ministries and civil society Implementation Group partners. The ISIG
would have the following responsibilities:

●  Development of a time-bound and resourced action plan.
●  Providing leadership and coordinating and mobilizing support for population programmes.
●  Tracking and assessing the impact of population programmes and making policy

recommendations based on the assessment results.

●  Assisting stakeholders and partners in the integration of priority population interventions.
●  Oversight on implementation of the Action Plan work towards achieving its main objectives,

which include: -

●  To improve knowledge and information base on population issues.
●  To improve policy framework and environment for population issues.
●  To enhance capacity for programme planning, coordination, monitoring and evaluation.
●  Coordinate the development and implementation of an M&E framework for the Plan of

Action.

The ISIG should report to the Cabinet through National Strategic Council Team on its work and
the progress of implementation at least twice a year to ensure political will and connectivity.

A Monitoring and Evaluation framework is essential for the accountability of responsible agencies
for  the  effective  implementation  of  the  Population  Policy  and  the  Plan  of  Action.  Periodic
monitoring will promote sectoral engagement and oversight as well as communications across
governmental departments and with social partners. An M&E framework will also be important
for continuous engagement with the public to get their feedback and recommendations on the
implementation of the Policy.

The M&E framework should also include sectoral frameworks to monitor activities in support of
the Policy goals. All assessments should be made available to the public.

54

 Conclusion

The Policy promotes measures for a vibrant society and economy characterized by Barbadians
and  other  resident  populations  who  are  engaged,  empowered  and  resilient  to  contribute  to
sustainable and inclusive development and take care of each other with the support of a strong
and engaged state.

The Policy is concerned with addressing the issues that flow from an aging population through
recommendations  for  targets  for  population  increases  through  managed  migration  as  well  as
through  interventions  that  may  spur  an  increase  in  fertility  rates.  The  Policy  also  prioritises
measures  that  will  address  the  quality-of-life  concerns  of  present  Barbadians  and  residents,
including under- and unemployment of youth. The Policy measures are consistent with Barbados
as a caring society especially those who belong to vulnerable sub-populations such as disabled
persons, the elderly, and children. The family as a basic unit of a caring society is affirmed with
attention paid to the sharing of the care burden between women and men, consistent with the
core value of gender equality.

Civil  society,  the  public  sector,  the  private  sector,  regulatory  mechanisms,  faith-based
organizations, community groups and the family have critical roles to play in setting the stage to
achieve the objectives that lend credence to the perception that Barbados is a caring society.

Recurring themes from the consultations which informed this Policy are i) gender equality in the
sharing  of  care  responsibilities  and  ii) the urgency of  education  reform away  from testing  and
towards an affirmative experience that draws out and values the diversities of individual skills and
competencies  and  grows  cultural  confidence;  and  iii)  the  strengthening  of  environmental
management.

Family and community caregiving is still a gendered experience given the traditional division of
labour which ascribes to women the predominant responsibility for care of children, the elderly
and vulnerable populations. This work continues to go under-valued and under-recognised. While
there are cultural shifts, these must be accelerated through regulation, resources and education
so that women and men can contribute to family and public life in ways that broaden their choices
based on mutual obligations to care and protect families.

The education sector should strengthen diverse civic engagement, labour market productivity,
security and more comprehensive experiences of fairness and inclusion. An education sector re-
envisaged away from the colonial and post-colonial focus on testing and realigned to the rounded
development needs of individuals and communities is also desirable to respond to the causes and
consequences of the projected population trends.

Barbados  has  championed  environmental  management,  and  this  must  be  sustained  and
amplified.  The  Policy  seeks  to  outline  strategies  for  managing  the  interactions  between  the
population and the natural environment to secure the ecological balance needed for a good

55

quality of life now and for future generations.

56

 Population Policy Goals and Action Plan

The Barbados Population Policy is based upon one demographic goal, that is, a goal that
seeks to increase the population size and structure and two (2) non-demographic goals.
The demographic goal facilitates changes in migration and fertility outcomes that would

Sub-goal 1.1: Increase the Population of Persons of Working Age

Domains
Population Dynamics

Objectives
To  increase  access  to  public  and  private
institutions  for  skilled  workers  to  address
unmet  labour  force  requirements  in  a  timely
manner.

Actions

●  Extend  the  categories  of  persons
entitled to citizenship and permanent
residence;

●  Retain  and encourage  repatriation  of
Barbadians and stem the brain drain;
and

●  Promote  managed  migration  of
persons who can bring capabilities and
resources  to  invest  in  the  future  of
Barbados and to contribute to areas of
the economy where there  are
unmet labour and skills requirements.

57

To develop and implement a managed
migration policy

●  Develop  and

implement  a  managed
migration policy that should be informed
by  an  industrial  policy  and  based  on  a
robust labour market information system.
Such  a  system  would  provide  a  systemic
basis  for  evaluating  the  demand  for  and
supply of labour by sector.

●  Remove

obstacles

associated  with
immigration protocols/initiatives that are
likely  to  inhibit  prospective  investment
and labour services

●  Review bureaucratic requirements for the
timely  granting  of  CSME  skilled  national
certification.
●  Secure  migrant

permanent residence

o  Family reunion
o  Access  to  affordable  health  care
and  education  by  accompanying

o  Access to financial services

●  Promote  dialogue  and  interaction  with
Barbadians  to  facilitate  integration  and
multi-culturalism  while  securing  and
advancing Barbadian cultural identity and
values.

●  Devise data collection systems to monitor
changes in population distribution due to
managed migration and analyse the

The  total  resident  population  estimates  were  derived  from  the  corresponding  2010  Census
estimates,  adjusted  by  subsequent births  and  deaths  which occurred each  year  to  1st  August
2021, with an adjustment for net migration over the intervening period.  This method was utilised
to counteract the large undercount.

Collected  data  were  also  compiled  on  the  institutionalized  population  and  the  homeless
population,  along  with  the  tabulated  Census  population,  as  at  1st  August  2021,  to  derive  an
estimate of the undercount in this Census.

The  total  resident  population  estimates  were  disaggregated  by  age-groups,  based  on  ratios
derived  from  the  tabulated  Census  results.  The  disaggregation  by  parish  was  based  on  ratios
derived from an analysis of administrative data utilised by the department.

 Appendix 2: Population projections 2020-2050 based on the maintenance of a
 replacement rate since 1980

While specifying the number of working-age people needed in Barbados to ensure social and economic

vibrancy could seem arbitrary, and especially when not sufficiently informed by labour force data and an

industrial policy framework, it is possible to establish credible and justifiable targets for population

growth based on the maintenance of the fertility replacement rate.

Should the fertility rate stayed at the replacement rate (2.1) since 1980, the population of Barbados would

have exceeded 360,000 by 2020 and would just fall short of eclipsing 400,000 by 2050.

## Product per capita22

While there may be a link between population size and economic growth, this link would be complex
and uncertain given history, global economic conditions, variations in productivity and external stresses
and shocks. In seeking to explore potentially feasible population sizes for Barbados, the following data
highlights data on population density and GDP per capita.

Drawing on population and GDP data from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators database23,
the following tables and charts outline the relevant population densities for countries with a GDP per
capita higher than Barbados, and population densities over 500 persons per square kilometre; Barbados’
population density is 653 persons per square kilometre.

As shown in Table 1, there are 12 countries with a GDP per capita higher than Barbados and with
population densities in excess of 500 persons per square kilometre. GDP per capita ranges from
US$22,579 (Bahrain) to US$166,911 (Monaco). Population density ranges from 518 persons per square
kilometre (Netherlands) to 20,566 (Macao SAR, China). It should be noted that there are four countries
with a lower population density than Barbados but with a higher GDP per capita (Aruba, San Marino,
Republic of Korea and the Netherlands).

levels of GDP per capita (Aruba, San Marino, Korea Republic and the Netherlands); however, as
noted previously, historical and structural issues would account for these differences. The

 growth on economic growth.

Executive Summary24

In surveying the literature on the impact of population  growth on economic growth, from the
somewhat bleak predictions of Malthus in 1789 to the contemporary works of (Bloom, Canning
and Sevill, 2001), (Pegou Sibe et al, 2016) and the (Chowdhury et al, 2018), there is overwhelming
evidence that there remains a lack of academic consensus on the potential relationship between
population growth and economic growth. The findings of the existing research indicate mixed
results, where various studies show that population growth either encourages, dissuades or is
independent of economic growth. This result suggests that assessing the relationship between
these two variables is a more complex matter, which is influenced not only by the composition
of  a  country’s  population  but  other  factors  including  the  structure  of  the  economy  and  the
prevailing social and finance policies and infrastructure.

Theoretical Basis

In  general,  the  literature  on  the  possible  linkage  between  population  growth  and  economic
growth remains largely unsettled. The question as to the potential consequences of population
growth on growth, remains an ongoing discussion that has continued across the generations. In
his 1798 writings, “An Essay on the Principle of Population,” Mr. Thomas Malthus, was one of the
first researchers to theorize on the direction and potential impacts of population growth. Mr.
Thomas  Malthus  purported  that  without  intervention,  the  population  would  increase  in  an
unchecked manner, beyond the capacity for the natural resources and food production systems
to sustain.

Malthus’ theory was rooted in the notion that the population grew in geometrical manner and
proposed that the population would likely double itself every twenty-five (25) years. In contrast
he proposed that subsistence food production increased only in an arithmetical ratio, as such,
even  with  the  removal  of  barriers  or  restrictions  to  food  production,  population  growth  will
eventually exceed the capacity for food production systems to meet demand. Malthus asserts
that the only necessity for sustenance may act as a constraint to population growth.

He suggested that this emerging reality would lead to severe economic and social consequences,
inclusive of depressed personal development, increased poverty, and famine, where the brunt of
these damaging effects will be borne by those in the lower classes of society. As it relates to the
labour market, Malthus proposed that a rapid unhindered increase in the population would also
lead  to  reduced  wages  and  deteriorating  working  conditions,  as  labour  supply  exceeds  the
demands of the market. On the other hand, the limitation in the supply of commodities would

79

lead to inflation, reduced standards of living, and an increase in the cost of care, particularly for
child rearing.

However, today’s conditions are generally not in line with the harshest of Malthus’ predictions.
As noted in the IMF World Economic Outlook, “The Global Demographic Transition,” September
2004, “Today the theories of Malthus appear to be happening in reverse. As economic prosperity
has risen around the world, fertility rates have fallen (and large gains in life expectancy have been
made), resulting in slower population growth and aging.” Additionally, Jinill Kim in the September
28,  2016  publication  of  the  IFDP  Notes  entitled  “The  Effects  of  Demographic  Change  on  GDP
Growth in OECD Economies”, stated that contradictory to the pessimist outlook of Malthus “that
GDP growth per capita would fall due to a continued rapid increase in world population …fertility
rates  instead  plunged  beginning  in  the  1960s.  The  global  fertility  rate  (defined  as  births  per
woman), which was between 5 and 6 before 1950, declined below 3 in 2000 and is projected to
be only around 2 by 2050. Correspondingly, the growth rate of the total world population, about
1
1  percent  in  1950,  decreased  to  below  1
4

percent in 2000, and is projected to stay barely

4

3

positive due to a longer life expectancy by 2050.”

The neoclassical Solow-Swan growth model introduced by Robert Solow and T. W. Swan in 1956,
asserts that output or growth in the economy (Y) at any time (t) is a function of the interaction
three main factors of production, inclusive of capital (K), labour (L) and technology/(effectiveness
of labour)(A), at that time, where labor is treated as equivalent to the size of the population and
AL is a concept referred to as effective of labour.

Y(t)= F(K(t), A(t)L(t))

( equation 1)

The Solow-Swan model which builds on the Harrod–Domar model, allows for the examination
of  changes  in  the  economy,  based  on  the  interaction  and  changes  in  factors  of  production.
However,  the  model  treats  technology  (effectiveness  of  labour)  and  labour  as  exogenous
(external)  variables,  which  grow  at  constant  rates.  As  such,  the  changes  in  the  economy  are
mainly viewed in terms of the changes reflected in capital. In particular, under the model output
per unit effective labour (y=Y/AL) can be seen as a function of capital per unit of effective labour
(k=K/AL),

y=f(k)

( equation 2)

While changes in capital per unit of effective labour is viewed as the difference between actual
investment per unit of effective labour [sf(k(t))], [where (s) is the rate of saving] and the amount
of investment required to keep capital per unit effective labour at the existing level (break-even).
In  this  instance  break-even  investment  [(n+g+  )  k(t)]  is  based  on  the  influence  of  the  rates  of
growth in the population (n) and technology (g) as well as the level of depreciation ( ) on the
existing capital stock.

∆k (t) = sf(k(t))- (n+g+  ) k(t)

( equation 3)

80

In general, the Solow-Swan model theorizes that a country’s economy converges to a balance
path growth/steady state, where k is k*, that is where actual investment per unit of effective
labour is equal to break-even investment [sf(k(t)) = (n+g+ )k(t)] . In this instance, each variable in
the model (Y, K and AL) is growing at constant rate (n+g). On a balance path of growth, capital
per worker and output per worker is determined solely by the rate of technical progress.

As  such,  based  on  the  model  (refer  to  equation  3)  an  increase  (decline)  in  the  growth  of  the
population  (n)  would  lead  to  a  decline  (increase)  in  the  k*.  This  would  lead  to  a  temporary
reduction (increase) in output per worker, while the overall output of the economy will increase
(decline) based on rate of population growth. However, the impact on the capital per worker,
output per worker and the overall output will dissipate eventually (returning to the balance path
of growth), given that in the long-term growth is driven solely by changes in technology.

In 1992, (Mankiw et al., 1992) introduced an augmented Solow model, which sought to account
for accumulation of human capital (education etc.) and physical capital with regard to the effect
of changes in the economy growth. Under this model “the negative impact of population growth
is larger as population growth now forces economies to use their scarce savings to equip young
people with physical and human capital. As a result, a 1% increase in population growth would
decrease per  capita  income  by 2%”25 The  potential  contribution  in education  and  other  social
services  to  development  has  been  recognized  by  others  such  as  (Ross-Brewster,  1996)  who
argued that the difference in development performance between countries (namely Barbados
and Jamaica) can be somewhat defined in terms of the investment in social sector. He purported
that the findings of empirical studies show that investment in education and health, together
with their impact in reducing income equality, is the key to sustained growth.

At  present  some  researchers  have  proposed  that  the  demographic  changes  and  economic
conditions observed  globally  are  more  consistent,  with the  perspective  highlighted  within  the
Demographic  Transition  Theory.  The  Demographic  Transition  Theory  was  first  introduced  by
Warren  Thompson  in  1929  and  later formalized by  Mr.  Frank  Notestein and  indicates that  all
countries  as part of their  developmental  process,  will transition  through various  demographic
changes in terms of patterns in mortality, fertility and growth rates over time. The demographic
dynamics experienced by various societies can be characterized within five stages, inclusive of:

  Stage  1:  preindustrial  society-  in  which  high  mortality  and  high  birth  rates  are
recorded,  leading  to  slow  population  growth.  This  stage  has  been  referred  to  as
Mathusian stagnation.

  Stage 2: developing society/early industrialization  - fall in the mortality rate due to
improvements in health care and sanitation, while the birth rate remains high, leading
to rapid population growth.

  Stage 3: the birth rate gradually begins to fall, while the mortality rate continues to
decline, which leads to a fall in the rate of population growth. The adjustments

observed at this stage are usually related to the introduction/enhancement of access
to family planning services and improved economic opportunities for women.

  Stage 4: birth and death rates are both low, stabilizing the population. These societies
are  usually  characterized  by  access  to  better  health  care  and  education  and  more
favorable opportunities for employment. In this stage, improvement in life
 expectancy is expected, while the population remains stable.

  Stage 5: At this stage the population begins to decline.

Bloom, Canning and Sevill, 2001 notes that varying positions on the impact of population growth
on the economy, “restricts, promote or is independent of economic growth”, focus mainly on the
concepts  of  population  size  and  growth.  Bloom,  Canning  and  Sevill,  2001  stated  that  the  age
structure  of  population,  resulting  from  the  demographic  dynamics  occurring  in  society,  has  a
significant  impact  on  the  performance  of  an  economy  and  determine  the  distribution  of
resources  in  a  country.  A  country  with  a  high  proportion  of  dependents  (whether  children  or
elderly) will devote a significant proportion of its resources to their care, which they argue can
depress growth. In contrast, where a majority of a country’s population is of working age “the
added productivity of this group can produce a "demographic dividend" of economic growth.”

In this context demographic dividend is defined as “the economic growth potential that can result
from  shifts  in  a  population’s  age  structure,  mainly  when  the  share  of  the  working  age
population(15 to 64) is larger than the non-working age share of the population (14 and younger,
and 65 and older).26 As highlighted in the United Nations Economist Analysis entitled “Harnessing
the  Economic  Dividends  form  Demographic  Change”  “A  larger  working-age  population  can
contribute  to  increased  labour  force  participation,  driving  economic  growth  and  productivity.
Individuals  in  this  group  tend  to  also  accumulate  savings  at  a  higher  rate,  facilitating  further
investment-led growth and development. A youthful and dynamic population brings fresh ideas
and energy to the economy, fostering innovation and entrepreneurship”27

Bloom,  Canning  and  Sevill,  2001  suggested  that  a  number  of  developing  countries  are
experiencing demographic transition, from high to low rates of fertility and mortality and as a
result will experience a period, where the population will increase significantly and provide an
opportunity  for  these  territories  to  capitalize  on  the  “demographic  dividend”.  However,  the
opportunity to maximize on the economic benefits related to “demographic dividend”, will be
dependent on the country facilitating the requisite enabling environment, inclusive of conducive
policies and infrastructure in the areas of health, education, family planning, and labor. Bloom,
Canning and Sevill, 2001 also purported that exploiting the advantage posed by “demographic
dividend” can lead to a sustained level of economic prosperity for a country for a long period.  On
the other hand, failure to institute such polices, can also have severe consequences. “At worst,
where an increase in the working-age population is not matched by increased job opportunities,

they will face costly penalties, such as rising unemployment and perhaps also higher crime rates
and political instability.”

Empirical Evidence

A large body of research has been undertaken to investigate the potential relationship between
population growth and economic growth over the years, the findings of which indicate varying
results with regards to the correlation of these variables, whether it be positive, or negative or
no relationship. The following are findings of select studies conducted in different countries on
this matter:

Callen  et.  A,  2004,  the  IMF  World  Outlook,  “The  Global  Demographic  Transition,”  September
2004  investigated  the  relationship  between  demographic  variables  (inclusive  of  1:  Share  of
working-age population; and 2: Share of elderly population) and per capita GDP growth, saving,
investment, the current and fiscal balance, for 115 country panel data set covering the period
1960-2000. The results indicated that per capita GDP growth is positively correlated with changes
in the relative size of the working-age population and negatively correlated with changes in the
share  of  the  elderly  population.  The  study  also  indicated  that  based  on  the  UN’s  population
projections  extending  to  2050  “the  projected  increase  in  elderly  dependency  ratios  and  the
projected decline in the share of the working-age population could result in slower per capita
GDP growth, and lower saving and investment” in advanced economies. The impact on growth
in developing countries varied by region, with favorable improvement expected in Africa and the
Middle East; changes on the demographics “are likely to weigh on growth in central and eastern
Europe and, to a lesser extent, in Asia and Latin America by 2050”.

Hock Tsen and Furuoka, 2005 observed mixed results during the investigation of the relationship
between  population  and  economic  growth  in  Asian  economies,  where  the  Granger  causality
method was applied. They concluded that the impact of population growth, whether beneficial
or detrimental, to economic growth in a country could not be predetermined with certainty. The
results confirmed a bidirectional Granger causality between population and economic growth for
Japan, Korea and Thailand; while for China, Singapore and the Philppines population is found to
Granger  cause  economic  growth  and  not  vice  versa.  For  Hong  Kong  and  Malaysia,  economic
growth  is  found  to  Granger  cause  population  growth  and  not  vice  versa.  For  Taiwan  and
Indonesia, there is no evidence of Granger causality between population and economic growth.

Klasen et al, 2007, in the working paper “The Impact of Population Growth on Economic Growth
and  Poverty  Reduction  in  Uganda”  investigated  the  likely  effect  of  population  growth  on  per
capita  economic  growth  and  poverty  in  Uganda,  using  cross  section  analysis  of  data  over  the
period  1960  to  2020.  The  results  indicated  that  population  growth  had  a  positive  impact  on
overall  economic  growth  (GDP),  under  both  the  Harrod-Domar  Model  and  Solow  Model;
however, an additional person/increase in population has less than proportionate influence on
economic growth.

Savas, 2008, investigated the causal relationship between population and per capita economic

83

growth  in  the  Central  Asian  Economies  (CAEs)  namely,  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyzstan,  Tajikistan,
Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Using the ARDL approach to cointegration, a relationship between
population and economic growth was determined as strong and positive in the CAEs over the
period of the analysis. The researcher suggested that the results imply that the CAEs seem to be
in the second stage of the demographic transition, called post-Malthusian regime, in which the
relationship  between  income  and  population  growth  remains  highly  strong  and  positive.  The
findings support the existence of a long-run relationship between population and real per capita
income  and  provide  strong  support  for  the  hypothesis  that  population  is  driving  growth.  The
results of causality tests suggest that there appears to be bi-directional causality when causality
is assumed to run from population to real per capita or vice versa in the long run for all of the
countries, while there are no feedback effects from real income to population in the short run,
only for Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.

Chang et. Al, 2014 investigated the link between population growth and economic growth in 21
countries over the period 1870-2013, with the application of the bootstrap panel causality test.
The  results  established  a  connection  between  population  growth  and  economic  growth  for  a
number of  the  countries;  however,  the  nature  of  the  relationship  varied  across  each  country,
while  no  relationship  between  population  and  economic  growth  was  established  for  other
territories.  A  one-way  Granger  causality  running  from  population  growth to  economic  growth
was  observed  for  Finland,  France,  Portugal,  and  Sweden;  and  a  one-way  Granger  causality
running from economic growth to population growth for Canada, Germany, Japan, Norway, and
Switzerland.  Additionally,  no  causal  relationship  between  population  growth  and  economic
growth is found in Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, Sri Lanka, the UK,
the USA and Uruguay; while a two-way relationship for population growth and economic growth
was observed for Austria and Italy. These results varied further when the data is split between
time period.

Kim, 2016 assessed how a changing age structure of the population (between four groups-ages
0-14, 15-39, 40-64, and 65+) affected GDP growth using cross-country data for 18 advanced OECD
countries. In general, the findings indicated that an increase in the population share of the young
and  elderly  population  tended  to  lower  the  growth  rate  of  GDP,  while  an  increase  in  the
population in the two groups between 15 and 65 years old would tend to boost the GDP growth
rate.  Demographic  changes  accounted  for  a  significant  portion  of  the  downward  trend  in
economic growth of these countries during the past decade.

Pegou Sibe et al, 2016 employed the Error Correction Model method to estimate the long run
relationship between population growth on economic growth and the granger causality test to
identify a bi-directional causality between economic growth and population growth (per capita
income) on panel data for 30 of the most populated countries of the world over the period 1960
to 2013. The results indicated that population growth acts as catalyst to economic growth and
that there is a bi-directional causality, when causality is assumed to run from population to real
per capita or vice versa in the long run for the selected countries reviewed.

Ahmad, R. N. and Ahmad, K., 2016, examined the relationship between economic growth (the

84

dependent  variable)  and  population,  fertility  rate,  employment,  education  and  investment
(independent variables) in Pakistan over a 35-year period (1981 to 2015). At that time Pakistan
was one of highest populated countries in the world and from 2011 to  2012  recorded a total
fertility rate of 3.4. Using the Unit root test of ADF, co-integration and auto-regressive distributed
lags  test  to  analyze  the  results,  it  was  concluded  that  population  and  fertility  rate  negatively
impacts economic growth in Pakistan. In contrast investment and employment are shown to have
a  positive  impact  on  economic  growth.  Ahmad,  and  Ahmad,  asserted  that  the  “overall  study
concludes that the population has a great hindrance in way of economic growth of Pakistan. If
not controlled than it can be very harmful for our economy.”

Chowdhury et al, 2018, in the paper entitled “Population and Economic Growth in Bangladesh:
Malthus Revisited”, the relationship between population growth and economic development in
terms  of  per  captia  GDP  was  examined  in  Bangladesh.  In  2016,  Bangladesh  represented  the
second fastest growing country in the world with 7.1% GDP growth. Bangladesh is one of the
most  densely  populated  countries  in  the  world  with  3,310  people  per  square  mile.  The  study
undertook a simple linear regression analysis of yearly times series data from the period of 1960
and  2017,  and  the  results  indicated  a  clear  negative  and  statistically  significant  relationship
between per capita GDP and population growth rate, where a 1% increase in population growth
leads  to  a  decrease  per  capita  GDP  by  1.95%.  The  author  concludes  that  population  growth
adversely  effects  the  economic  development  of  Bangladesh,  which  supports  the  Malthus
prediction and suggests that such growth places pressure on investment growth and diminishes
the savings rate.

Conclusion

In  conclusion,  there  are  numerous  viewpoints  regarding  the  potential  relationship  between
population growth and economic growth within territories. However, there does not exist a “one
size fit all” theory, as it relates to impact of the population growth on the economy. Rather the
mixed  results  from  the  aforementioned  studies  suggests  that  the  potential  impact  whether
beneficial,  detrimental  or  non-existent,  between  population  growth  and  economic  growth/
development  is  a  complex  matter,  which  is  influenced  not  only  by  the  structure,  size  or
composition of a country’s population but other factors including the structure and size of the
economy, the stage of country’s development and existing social and finance infrastructure and
policies;  particularly
in  the  areas  of  health,  sanitation,  education  and  governance.
Notwithstanding the lack of consensus between the nexus of population growth and economic
growth as shown through the work of Ross-Brewster, investment in social capital is key to the
development  of  countries,  particularly  as  it  relates  to  the  Human  Development  Index  and
sustained growth.

 Appendix 5: Potential Impact OECD Policy (Global minimum tax rate) on ability
 to make Tax/ fiscal Policy:

In  October  2021,  137  countries  under  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-Operation  and
Development  (OECD)/G20  Inclusive  Framework  for  Base  Erosion  and  Profit  Shifting  Project,
agreed to a two-pillar strategy to reform the global tax regime, to tackle tax avoidance, improve
the coherence of international tax rules, ensure a more transparent tax environment and address
the tax challenges arising from digitalization.

Under  Pillar  two  of  the  reform,  a  global  minimum  tax  rate  of  15  percent  for  multinational
enterprises (MNEs) will be introduced within countries, which is expected to generate $USD150
billion in additional global tax revenue annually. This reform intends to dissuade unproductive/
ineffective tax competition among countries, by instituting a floor corporate tax rate. Although
the  long-term  implications  of  this  measure  domestically  is  unknown;  it  is  recognized  that  the
adoption  of  this  measure,  effectively  removes  the  ability  of  developing  countries  such  as
Barbados  to  utilize  low  tax  based  incentives  as  part  of  their  toolkit  to  attract  investment  and
compete on the global stage. Such measures have traditionally been employed by developing
countries,  as  a  means  to  elevate  their  international  competitiveness  in  comparison  to  other
advanced  economies  to  attract  investment  and  build  desired  skillsets  domestically,  through
shared knowledge and experiences as well as infrastructure investment. Moreover, such reforms
may  potentially  act  as  a  disincentive  for  established  multinational  enterprises  to  continue
domestic  operations,  in  favour  of  other  territories,  with  the  fiscal  space  or  technological
advancement to offer non-tax related incentives for investment. Consequently, the adoption of
the global minimum tax rate, will likely diminish future foreign investment through MNEs to the
country as well as hinder the expansion of social capital associated with such investment.

Foreign  investment  from  MNEs  sources  remain  a  key  driver  of  economic  activity  within  the
country. At present, the majority of such investment is captured through the Finance & Insurance
and the Business Services sectors, with both industries accounting for 8.8 percent of the share of
GDP over the period 2008-2017, falling within the top five industries of the economy.

Although  Barbados  remains  an  attractive  destination  for  investment  with  a  highly  educated
workforce,  sound  infrastructure  (road  network,  telecommunications,  water,  electricity  etc.)  a
well-established and regulated financial and banking system, as well as a respected political and
legal system, there is a need to adopt a strategic approach to counteract the potential negative
consequences related to the introduction of a global minimum tax rate. This will likely include a
collection  of  measures  to  enhance  the  business  environment,  improve  the  productivity  and
suitability of the workforce and reinvestment in other sectors of economy.
