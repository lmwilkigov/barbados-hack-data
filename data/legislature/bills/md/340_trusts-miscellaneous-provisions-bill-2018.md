(2)

A trust has the following characteristics

(a)

(b)

PART II

Creation of trusts

4.

A trust shall only be created by instrument in writing.

Presumption against avoidance of trust

5.
A trust that does not contain a power of revocation is irrevocable by
the settlor or his legal personal representative notwithstanding that the trust is
voluntary.

8

Duration of trust and accumulation of income

6.(1)
Subject  to  subsection  (2),  a  trust  terminates  on  the  one  hundredth
anniversary after the date of its creation, if not sooner terminated in accordance
with the terms of the trust instrument.

Subsection  (1)  does  not  apply  to  a  purpose  trust  or  a  trust  established
(2)
exclusively for charitable purposes, such a trust may continue in force without
any limit as to time.

The rule of law known as the "rule against perpetuities" does not apply to

(3)
a trust.

The terms of a trust may direct or authorise the accumulation of all or part
(4)
of the income of the trust for a period not exceeding 100 years from the date of
the creation of the trust.

Proper law of trust

7.(1)
of

(a)

(b)

(c)

Subject to subsections (2) and (3), the proper law of a trust is the law

the jurisdiction expressed by the terms of the trust as the proper law,
or if not so expressed;

the jurisdiction intended by the settlor to be the proper law, or if not so
expressed or intended; or

the jurisdiction with which the trust at the time it was created had the
closest connection.

Where  the  proper  law  of  a  trust  is  changed  from  the  law  of  another
(2)
jurisdiction  to  the  law  of  Barbados,  the  change  is  valid  and  effective  if  it  is
recognised by the law of the other jurisdiction.

Where the terms of a trust provide for the proper law of the trust to be
(3)
changed from the law of Barbados to the law of another jurisdiction the change

9

is valid and effective only if the new proper law recognises the validity of the
trust and the respective interests of the beneficiaries.

In  ascertaining  the  law  with  which  a  trust  has  its  closest  connection,

(4)
reference shall be had in particular to

(a)

(b)

(c)

the place of residence or business of the trustee;

the place of administration of the trust designated by the settlor;

the situs of the assets of the trust; and

(d)

the purposes of the trust and the places where they are to be fulfilled.

(5)

The terms of a trust may provide

(a)

for the severable aspects of the trust, particularly the administration of
the trust, to be governed by a different law from the proper law of the
trust; and

(b)

for the law governing a severable aspect of the trust to be changed from
the law of Barbados to the law of another jurisdiction and vice versa.

A change in the proper law of a trust shall not affect the legality or validity

(6)
of or render any person liable for anything done before the change.

Subject to subsection (5)(a), the proper law of the trust shall govern the

(7)
validity of the trust, its construction, its effects and its administration.

When the proper law of a trust or the law governing the severable aspects
(8)
of a trust is changed from the law of Barbados to the law of another jurisdiction
(herein called the "new law") no provision of the new law of Barbados operates
to render the trust void, invalid or unlawful or to render void, invalid or unlawful
any function conferred on the trustee under the new law.

Where the proper law of a trust or the law governing the severable aspects
(9)
of a trust is changed from the law of another jurisdiction (herein called the "old
law") to the law of Barbados no provision of the old law operates to render the
trust void, invalid or unlawful or to render void, invalid or unlawful any function
conferred on the trustee under the law of Barbados.

10

enforce  the  trust  and  for  the  appointment  of  a  successor  to  such  a
protector; and

the terms of the trust specify the event upon the occurrence of which
the trust terminates and provides for the disposition of surplus assets
of the trust upon its termination.

no one has been appointed as successor to the protector referred to in
paragraph (a) in accordance with the terms of the trust,

the trustee shall as soon as practicable, apply to the court for the appointment of
a protector of the trust.

(2)
of the protector to enforce the trust and the appointment takes effect from the
date of the order.

A trustee who fails to comply with subsection (1) is guilty of an offence

(3)
and liable on summary conviction to a fine of $10 000.

In addition to the fine specified in subsection (3) the court may order the
(4)
trustee referred to in that subsection to cease to be a trustee of non-charitable

(5)
took all reasonable steps and exercised due diligence to comply with subsection
(1).

Custody of copy of instrument

12.(1)

position of the trust.

(2)
file  with  the  Director,  upon  payment  of  the  prescribed  fee,  the  information
referred to in subsection (1)(b)(i), (ii) and (iii), and the Director shall issue to the
trustee a certificate of registration in the prescribed form.

(4)
Director for a certified copy of the certificate of registration issued in respect of
the trust.

The instrument, register and documents referred to in subsection (1) are
(5)
confidential  and  not  available  to  the  public,  but  the  trustee  shall  allow  the
protector or a person authorised by the protector to inspect the instrument, register
and documents.

(6)

Where a trustee of a trust created under section 9

(a)

(b)

(c)

fails to comply with subsection (1) or (5);

refuses to allow a person referred to in subsection (5) to inspect the
instrument, register or documents referred to in that subsection; or

in any deed, register or document referred to in subsection (5) makes,
or authorises the making of, any statement that he knows to be false or
does not believe to be true,

and in addition to such fine the court may order the trustee to cease to be a trustee
of non-charitable purpose trusts for 2 years.

13

Extension of cy-près

13.(1)

trust may provide that the doctrine of cy-près is, mutatis mutandis, applicable
thereto.

For  the  purpose  of  subsection  (1),  where  a  purpose  that  is  reasonably
(2)
similar to the original purpose cannot be found, a purpose that is not contrary to
the  spirit  and  meaning  of  the  settlement  may  be  substituted  for  the  original
purpose.
