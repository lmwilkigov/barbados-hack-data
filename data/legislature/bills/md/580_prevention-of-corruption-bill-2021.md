the  officer  considers  has  relevant  information,  notice  in  writing  requiring  the
person, with respect to any matter relevant to the investigation for the purposes
of which the order is sought, to

(a)

(b)

(c)

answer any question, either at a time and place specified in the notice
or at once;

provide  any  information  specified  in  the  notice,  by  a  time  and  in  a

time and in a manner so specified or at once.

An application for a disclosure order shall be made without notice and shall
(2)
state that a person specified in the application is subject to an investigation under
this Act.

17

The requirements referred to in subsection (1) are that there are reasonable

(3)
grounds for

(a)

suspecting that the person specified in the application has committed
an offence under Part II; and

(b)

believing that

(i)

(ii)

information which may be provided in compliance with the order
is likely to be of substantial value, whether or not by itself, to the
investigation for the purposes of which the order is sought; and

it is in the public interest for the information to be provided, having
regard  to  the  benefit  likely  to  accrue  to  the  investigation  if  the
information is obtained.

A person is not bound to comply with a requirement imposed by a notice
(4)
given under a disclosure order unless evidence of authority to give the notice is
produced to him.

without reasonable excuse, fails to comply with a requirement imposed

(9)
unless

(a)

(b)

evidence relating to it is adduced; or

a question relating to it is asked,

by or on behalf of the person in the proceedings arising out of the prosecution.

A  disclosure  order  has  effect  notwithstanding  any  obligation  as  to
(10)
confidentiality  or  any  other  restriction  upon  the  disclosure  of  information
imposed by any enactment, rule of law or otherwise.

A disclosure order does not require a person to provide privileged material,
(11)
but an attorney-at-law may be required to produce the name and address of a
client.

An investigative officer may take copies of or extracts from any documents
(12)
produced  by  a  person  in  connection  with  complying  with  a  requirement  of  a
disclosure order.

19

(13)
Any document produced in compliance with a disclosure order may be
retained for so long as it is necessary to retain it, as opposed to copies of it, in
connection with the investigation for the purposes of which the order was made.

Notwithstanding  subsection  (13),  where  an  investigative  officer  has

(14)
reasonable grounds for believing that the document

(a)

may need to be produced for the purposes of any legal proceedings;
and

(b)

might otherwise be unavailable for those purposes,

the document may be retained until the proceedings are concluded.

An investigative officer who applied for a disclosure order or any person
(15)
affected by the order may apply to a judge in Chambers to vary or discharge the
order, and the judge may do so where he considers it appropriate.

For the purposes of subsection (1), “relevant information” is information,
(16)
whether or not contained in a document, which the investigative officer considers
to be relevant to the investigation.

15.(1)
Where on an application made by an investigative officer, a judge in
Chambers is satisfied of the circumstances set out in subsection (3), the judge
may issue a warrant authorising the officer to

(a)

(b)

enter  and  search  the  premises  specified  in  the  application  for  the
warrant; and

seize and retain any material found on the premises which is likely to
be of substantial value, whether or not by itself, to the investigation for
the purposes of which the application is made.

(2)

An application for a search and seizure warrant shall

(a)

(b)

specify the person subject to investigation;

state that the warrant is sought for the purposes of the investigation;

20

(c)

(d)

specify the premises in respect of which the warrant is sought; and

specify the material in respect of which the warrant is sought or, where
the material cannot be identified at the time of the application, state
that there are reasonable grounds for believing that there is material on
the premises that

(i)

(ii)

relates to the person specified in the application or the question
whether that person has committed an offence under Part II; and

is likely to be of substantial value, whether or not by itself, to the
investigation for the purposes of which the warrant is sought.

(3)

The circumstances referred to in subsection (1) are that

(a)

(b)

a disclosure order in relation to material has not been complied with
and there are reasonable grounds for believing that the material is on
the premises specified in the application for the warrant; or

there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the person specified
in the application for the warrant has committed an offence under Part
II and

(i)

the conditions specified in subsection (4) are fulfilled; or

(ii)

the conditions specified in subsection (5) are fulfilled.

(4)

The conditions referred to in subsection (3)(b)(i) are that

(a)

there are reasonable grounds for believing that

(i)

any material on the premises specified in the application for the
warrant is likely to be of substantial value, whether or not by itself,
to the investigation for the purposes of which the warrant is sought;
and

(ii)

it is in the public interest for the material to be obtained, having
regard  to  the  benefit  likely  to  accrue  to  the  investigation  if  the
material is obtained; and

21

(b)

it would not be appropriate to make a disclosure order because

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

it  is  not  practicable  to  communicate  with  any  person  against
whom the disclosure order could be made;

it is not practicable to communicate with any person who would
be required to comply with an order to grant entry to the premises;
or

the  investigation  might  be  seriously  prejudiced  unless  an
investigative  officer  is  able  to  secure  immediate  access  to  the
material.

(5)

The conditions referred to in subsection (3)(b)(ii) are that

(a)

there are reasonable grounds for believing where the material cannot
be identified at the time of the application, that there is material on the
premises specified in the application for the warrant that

(i)

(ii)

relates to the person specified in the application or the question
whether he has committed an offence under Part II; and

is likely to be of substantial value, whether or not by itself, to the
investigation for the purposes of which the warrant is sought; and

(b)

there are reasonable grounds for believing that it is in the public interest
for the material to be obtained, having regard to the benefit likely to
accrue to the investigation if the material is obtained; and

(c)

one of the following applies:

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

it  is  not  practicable  to  communicate  with  any  person  against
whom a disclosure order could be made;

entry  to  the  premises  will  not  be  granted  unless  a  warrant  is
produced; or

the  investigation  might  be  seriously  prejudiced  unless  an
investigative  officer  arriving  at  the  premises  is  able  to  secure
immediate entry to them.

22

A search and seizure warrant does not confer the right to seize privileged

(6)
material.

Offence of tipping off etc.

under Part II has been, is being, or is about to be conducted, or that an order under
this Part has been made or may be made and

investigation is likely to be prejudiced; or

permits the falsification, concealment, destruction or disposal of, any
matter or thing that he knows or suspects is or is likely to be relevant
to the investigation,

is guilty of an offence and is liable, on conviction on indictment to a fine of $250
000 or to imprisonment for 10 years or to both.

PART IV

EVIDENCE

Evidence of unexplained property

17.(1)
that

In proceedings against a person for an offence under Part II, the fact

(a)

the person

(i)

(ii)

is  in  possession,  for  which  he  cannot  satisfactorily  account,  of
property disproportionate to his known sources of income; or

was, at or about the date of the alleged offence or at any time since
the date of the alleged offence, in possession, for which he cannot

23

satisfactorily account, of property disproportionate to his known
sources of income; or

(b)

the person had, at or about the date of the alleged offence or at any time
since the date of the alleged offence, obtained an accretion to property
for which he cannot satisfactorily account,

may be proved and may be taken by the court as corroborating the testimony of
any  witness  giving  evidence  in  such  proceedings  that  the  person  solicited  or
accepted an advantage and showing that such advantage was solicited or accepted
as an inducement or reward.

For the purposes of subsection (1), a person accused of an offence under
(2)
Part II shall be presumed to be or to have been in possession of property, or to
have obtained an accretion thereto, where such property is or was held, or such
accretion was obtained, by any other person who, having regard to his relationship
to the accused or to any other circumstances, there is reason to believe is or was
holding  such  property  or  obtained  such  accretion  in  trust  for  or  otherwise  on
behalf of the accused or as a gift from the accused.

Presumption of corruption in certain cases

18.
Where in any proceedings for an offence under section 4 or section
8(1)  or  (2),  it  is  proved  that  the  accused  gave  or  accepted  an  advantage,  the
advantage shall be presumed to have been given or accepted as such inducement
or reward as is alleged in the particulars of the offence unless, on a balance of
probabilities, the contrary is proved.

Certain defences not available

19.
it is proved that

Where, in any proceedings for an offence under any section of Part II,

(a)

the accused accepted an advantage, believing or suspecting or having
grounds  to  believe  or  suspect  that  the  advantage  was  given  as  an
inducement to or reward for or otherwise on account of his doing or

24

refraining from doing any act referred to in that section, it shall be no
defence that

(i)

(ii)

he did not actually have the power, right or opportunity so to do
or refrain from doing;

he accepted the advantage without intending so to do or refrain
from doing; or

(iii)

he did not in fact so do or refrain from doing;

(b)

(c)

the accused offered an advantage to another person as an inducement
to, or reward for, or otherwise on account of, that other person’s doing
or refraining from doing, or having done or refrained from doing, any
act referred to in that section, believing or suspecting or having reason
to  believe  or  suspect  that  the  other  person  had  the  power,  right  or
opportunity so to do or refrain, it shall be no defence that the other
person had no such power, right or opportunity;

Preamble

Concerned about the seriousness of problems and threats posed by corruption to the stability
and security of societies, undermining the institutions and values of democracy, ethical values
and justice and jeopardizing sustainable development and the rule of law,

Concerned also about the links between corruption and other forms of crime, in particular

organized crime and economic crime, including money-laundering,

Concerned further about cases of corruption that involve vast quantities of assets, which may
constitute a substantial proportion of the resources of States, and that threaten the political stability
and sustainable development of those States,

affects all societies and economies, making international cooperation to prevent and control it
essential,

Convinced also that a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach is required to prevent

and combat corruption effectively,

Convinced further that the availability of technical assistance can play an important role in
enhancing the ability of States, including by strengthening capacity and by institution-building,
to prevent and combat corruption effectively,

Convinced  that  the  illicit  acquisition  of  personal  wealth  can  be  particularly  damaging  to

democratic institutions, national economies and the rule of law,

Acknowledging the fundamental principles of due process of law in criminal proceedings and

States  and  that  they  must  cooperate  with  one  another,  with  the  support  and  involvement  of
individuals  and  groups  outside  the  public  sector,  such  as  civil  society,  non-governmental
organizations  and  community-based  organizations,  if  their  efforts  in  this  area  are  to  be
effective,

50 of this Convention. Where appropriate and consistent with their domestic legal system, States
Parties  shall  consider  assisting  each  other  in  investigations  of  and  proceedings  in  civil  and
administrative matters relating to corruption.

In matters of international cooperation, whenever dual criminality is considered a
2.
requirement, it shall be deemed fulfilled irrespective of whether the laws of the requested State
Party place the offence within the same category of offence or denominate the offence by the
same terminology as the requesting State Party, if the conduct underlying the offence for which
assistance is sought is a criminal offence under the laws of both States Parties.

50

Article 44. Extradition

1.
This  article  shall  apply  to  the  offences  established  in  accordance  with  this
Convention where the person who is the subject of the request for extradition is present in the
territory of the requested State Party, provided that the offence for which extradition is sought is
punishable under the domestic law of both the requesting State Party and the requested State
Party.

2.
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of this article, a State Party whose
law so permits may grant the extradition of a person for any of the offences covered by this
Convention that are not punishable under its own domestic law.

3.
If the request for extradition includes several separate offences, at least one of which
is extraditable under this article and some of which are not extraditable by reason of their period
of imprisonment but are related to offences established in accordance with this Convention, the
requested State Party may apply this article also in respect of those offences.

4.
Each of the offences to which this article applies shall be deemed to be included as
an extraditable offence in any extradition treaty existing between States Parties. States Parties
undertake  to  include  such  offences  as  extraditable  offences  in  every  extradition  treaty  to  be
concluded between them. A State Party whose law so permits, in case it uses this Convention as
the basis for extradition, shall not consider any of the offences established in accordance with
this Convention to be a political offence.

5.
If  a  State  Party  that  makes  extradition  conditional  on  the  existence  of  a  treaty
receives a request for extradition from another State Party with which it has no extradition treaty,
it may consider this Convention the legal basis for extradition in respect of any offence to which
this article applies.

6.

A State Party that makes extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty shall:

(a)

(b)

At the time of deposit of its instrument of ratification, acceptance or approval of or
accession to this Convention, inform the Secretary-General of the United Nations
whether it will take this Convention as the legal basis for cooperation on extradition
with other States Parties to this Convention; and

If it does not take this Convention as the legal basis for cooperation on extradition,
seek, where appropriate, to conclude treaties on extradition with other States Parties
to this Convention in order to implement this article.

51

7.
States Parties that do not make extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty
shall recognize offences to which this article applies as extraditable offences between themselves.

8.
Extradition shall be subject to the conditions provided for by the domestic law of
the requested State Party or by applicable extradition treaties, including, inter alia, conditions in
relation to the minimum penalty requirement for extradition and the grounds upon which the
requested State Party may refuse extradition.

9.
States Parties shall, subject to their domestic law, endeavour to expedite extradition
procedures and to simplify evidentiary requirements relating thereto in respect of any offence to
which this article applies.

10.
Subject to the provisions of its domestic law and its extradition treaties, the requested
State Party may, upon being satisfied that the circumstances so warrant and are urgent and at the
request of the requesting State Party, take a person whose extradition is sought and who is present
in its territory into custody or take other appropriate measures to ensure his or her presence at
extradition proceedings.

11.
A State Party in whose territory an alleged offender is found, if it does not extradite
such person in respect of an offence to which this article applies solely on the ground that he or
she is one of its nationals, shall, at the request of the State Party seeking extradition, be obliged
to submit the case without undue delay to its competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution.
Those authorities shall take their decision and conduct their proceedings in the same manner as
in the case of any other offence of a grave nature under the domestic law of that State Party. The
States  Parties  concerned  shall  cooperate  with  each  other,  in  particular  on  procedural  and
evidentiary aspects, to ensure the efficiency of such prosecution.

12.
Whenever a State Party is permitted under its domestic law to extradite or otherwise
surrender one of its nationals only upon the condition that the person will be returned to that State
Party to serve the sentence imposed as a result of the trial or proceedings for which the extradition
or  surrender  of  the  person  was  sought  and  that  State  Party  and  the  State  Party  seeking  the
extradition of the person agree with this option and other terms that they may deem appropriate,
such conditional extradition or surrender shall be sufficient to discharge the obligation set forth
in paragraph 11 of this article.

If extradition, sought for purposes of enforcing a sentence, is refused because the
13.
person sought is a national of the requested State Party, the requested State Party shall, if its
domestic law so permits and in conformity with the requirements of such law, upon application
of  the  requesting  State  Party,  consider  the  enforcement  of  the  sentence  imposed  under  the
domestic law of the requesting State Party or the remainder thereof.

52

14.
Any person regarding whom proceedings are being carried out in connection with
any of the offences to which this article applies shall be guaranteed fair treatment at all stages of
the proceedings, including enjoyment of all the rights and guarantees provided by the domestic
law of the State Party in the territory of which that person is present.

15.
Nothing  in  this  Convention  shall  be  interpreted  as  imposing  an  obligation  to
extradite if the requested State Party has substantial grounds for believing that the request has
been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of that person’s sex,
race, religion, nationality, ethnic origin or political opinions or that compliance with the request
would cause prejudice to that person’s position for any one of these reasons.

16.
offence is also considered to involve fiscal matters.

States Parties may not refuse a request for extradition on the sole ground that the

17.
Before  refusing  extradition,  the  requested  State  Party  shall,  where  appropriate,
consult with the requesting State Party to provide it with ample opportunity to present its opinions
and to provide information relevant to its allegation.

18.
arrangements to carry out or to enhance the effectiveness of extradition.

States  Parties  shall  seek  to  conclude  bilateral  and  multilateral  agreements  or

Article 45. Transfer of sentenced persons

States Parties may consider entering into bilateral or multilateral agreements or arrangements
on  the  transfer  to  their  territory  of  persons  sentenced  to  imprisonment  or  other  forms  of
deprivation of liberty for offences established in accordance with this Convention in order that
they may complete their sentences there.

Article 46. Mutual legal assistance

1.
States Parties shall afford one another the widest measure of mutual legal assistance
in investigations, prosecutions and judicial proceedings in relation to the offences covered by this
Convention.

2.
Mutual legal assistance shall be afforded to the fullest extent possible under relevant
laws,  treaties,  agreements  and  arrangements  of  the  requested  State  Party  with  respect  to
investigations, prosecutions and judicial proceedings in relation to the offences for which a legal
person may be held liable in accordance with article 26 of this Convention in the requesting State
Party.

without prior request, transmit information relating to criminal matters to a competent authority
in  another  State  Party  where  they  believe  that  such  information  could  assist  the  authority  in
undertaking or successfully concluding inquiries and criminal proceedings or could result in a
request formulated by the latter State Party pursuant to this Convention.

5.
The  transmission  of  information  pursuant  to  paragraph  4  of  this  article  shall  be
without prejudice to inquiries and criminal proceedings in the State of the competent authorities
providing the information. The competent authorities receiving the information shall comply with
a request that said information remain confidential, even temporarily, or with restrictions on its
use. However, this shall not prevent the receiving State Party from disclosing in its proceedings
information that is exculpatory to an accused person. In such a case, the receiving State Party
shall notify the transmitting State Party prior to the disclosure and, if so requested, consult with
the transmitting State Party. If, in an exceptional case, advance notice is not possible, the receiving
State Party shall inform the transmitting State Party of the disclosure without delay.

54

6.
The provisions of this article shall not affect the obligations under any other treaty,
bilateral or multilateral, that governs or will govern, in whole or in part, mutual legal assistance.

7.
Paragraphs 9 to 29 of this article shall apply to requests made pursuant to this article
if the States Parties in question are not bound by a treaty of mutual legal assistance. If those States

Each State Party shall designate a central authority that shall have the responsibility
and power to receive requests for mutual legal assistance and either to execute them or to transmit

shall  be  without  prejudice  to  the  right  of  a  State  Party  to  require  that  such  requests  and
communications be addressed to it through diplomatic channels and, in urgent circumstances,
where the States Parties agree, through the International Criminal Police Organization, if possible.

other, permit the hearing to take place by video conference if it is not possible or desirable for

States Parties shall consider concluding bilateral or multilateral agreements or arrangements
whereby,  in  relation  to  matters  that  are  the  subject  of  investigations,  prosecutions  or  judicial

permitted  by  the  basic  principles  of  its  domestic  legal  system  and  in  accordance  with  the
conditions prescribed by its domestic law, take such measures as may be necessary, within its
means, to allow for the appropriate use by its competent authorities of controlled delivery and,
where it deems appropriate, other special investigative techniques, such as electronic or other
forms  of  surveillance  and  undercover  operations,  within  its  territory,  and  to  allow  for  the
admissibility in court of evidence derived therefrom.

61

The return of assets pursuant to this chapter is a fundamental principle of this Convention, and

regard.

Article 52. Prevention and detection of transfers of proceeds of crime

1.
Without prejudice to article 14 of this Convention, each State Party shall take such
measures  as  may  be  necessary,  in  accordance  with  its  domestic  law,  to  require  financial
institutions within its jurisdiction to verify the identity of customers, to take reasonable steps to
determine the identity of beneficial owners of funds deposited into high-value accounts and to
conduct enhanced scrutiny of accounts sought or maintained by or on behalf of individuals who
are, or have been, entrusted with prominent public functions and their family members and close
associates. Such enhanced scrutiny shall be reasonably designed to detect suspicious transactions
for  the  purpose  of  reporting  to  competent  authorities  and  should  not  be  so  construed  as  to
discourage or prohibit financial institutions from doing business with any legitimate customer.

In order to facilitate implementation of the measures provided for in paragraph 1 of
2.
this  article,  each  State  Party,  in  accordance  with  its  domestic  law  and  inspired  by  relevant

62

initiatives  of  regional,  interregional  and  multilateral  organizations  against  money-laundering,
shall:

(a)

(b)

Issue  advisories  regarding  the  types  of  natural  or  legal  person  to  whose  accounts
financial  institutions  within  its  jurisdiction  will  be  expected  to  apply  enhanced
scrutiny, the types of accounts and transactions to which to pay particular attention
and appropriate account-opening, maintenance and record-keeping measures to take
concerning such accounts; and

Where appropriate, notify financial institutions within its jurisdiction, at the request
of another State Party or on its own initiative, of the identity of particular natural or
legal persons to whose accounts such institutions will be expected to apply enhanced
scrutiny, in addition to those whom the financial institutions may otherwise identify.

3.
In the context of paragraph 2 (a) of this article, each State Party shall implement
measures to ensure that its financial institutions maintain adequate records, over an appropriate
period of time, of accounts and transactions involving the persons mentioned in paragraph 1 of
this  article,  which  should,  as  a  minimum,  contain  information  relating  to  the  identity  of  the
customer as well as, as far as possible, of the beneficial owner.

4.
With  the  aim  of  preventing  and  detecting  transfers  of  proceeds  of  offences
established in accordance with this Convention, each State Party shall implement appropriate and
effective  measures  to  prevent,  with  the  help  of  its  regulatory  and  oversight  bodies,  the
establishment of banks that have no physical presence and that are not affiliated with a regulated
financial group. Moreover, States Parties may consider requiring their financial institutions to
refuse to enter into or continue a correspondent banking relationship with such institutions and
to guard against establishing relations with foreign financial institutions that permit their accounts
to be used by banks that have no physical presence and that are not affiliated with a regulated
financial group.

5.
Each State Party shall consider establishing, in accordance with its domestic law,
effective  financial  disclosure  systems  for  appropriate  public  officials  and  shall  provide  for
appropriate  sanctions  for  non-compliance.  Each  State  Party  shall  also  consider  taking  such
measures as may be necessary to permit its competent authorities to share that information with
the competent authorities in other States Parties when necessary to investigate, claim and recover
proceeds of offences established in accordance with this Convention.

Each  State  Party  shall  consider  taking  such  measures  as  may  be  necessary,  in
6.
accordance with its domestic law, to require appropriate public officials having an interest in or
signature or other authority over a financial account in a foreign country to report that relationship

63

to  appropriate  authorities  and  to  maintain  appropriate  records  related  to  such  accounts.  Such
measures shall also provide for appropriate sanctions for non-compliance.

Article 53. Measures for direct recovery of property

Each State Party shall, in accordance with its domestic law:

(a)

(b)

(c)

Take such measures as may be necessary to permit another State Party to initiate civil
action in its courts to establish title to or ownership of property acquired through the
commission of an offence established in accordance with this Convention;

Take such measures as may be necessary to permit its courts to order those who have
committed  offences  established  in  accordance  with  this  Convention  to  pay
compensation  or  damages  to  another  State  Party  that  has  been  harmed  by  such
offences; and

Take such measures as may be necessary to permit its courts or competent authorities,
when having to decide on confiscation, to recognize another State Party’s claim as a
legitimate  owner  of  property  acquired  through  the  commission  of  an  offence
established in accordance with this Convention.

Article 54. Mechanisms for recovery of property through international cooperation in
confiscation

they have jurisdiction, to order the confiscation of such property of foreign origin by
adjudication  of  an  offence  of  money-laundering  or  such  other  offence  as  may  be
within its jurisdiction or by other procedures authorized under its domestic law; and

Consider taking such measures as may be necessary to allow confiscation of such
property  without  a  criminal  conviction  in  cases  in  which  the  offender  cannot  be
prosecuted by reason of death, flight or absence or in other appropriate cases.

Each State Party, in order to provide mutual legal assistance upon a request made
2.

law:

64

(a)

(b)

(c)

Take such measures as may be necessary to permit its competent authorities to freeze
or seize property upon a freezing or seizure order issued by a court or competent
authority of a requesting State Party that provides a reasonable basis for the requested
State Party to believe that there are sufficient grounds for taking such actions and
that the property would eventually be subject to an order of confiscation for purposes
of paragraph 1 (a) of this article;

Take such measures as may be necessary to permit its competent authorities to freeze
or seize property upon a request that provides a reasonable basis for the requested
State Party to believe that there are sufficient grounds for taking such actions and
that the property would eventually be subject to an order of confiscation for purposes
of paragraph 1 (a) of this article; and

Consider taking additional measures to permit its competent authorities to preserve
property for confiscation, such as on the basis of a foreign arrest or criminal charge
related to the acquisition of such property.
