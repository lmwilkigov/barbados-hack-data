Consequently, the Crown sought to acquire 3.355 hectares or thereabouts instead.
The said parcel of land was: acquired under the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, Cap. 228 and became vested in the Crown by virtue of a Notice of the acquisition which was published in the Official Gazette on the 2™ day of September, 1991 as Statutory Instrument No. 118 of 1991.
An Abattoir was subsequently constructed in the parish of Christ Church, which obviated the need to construct one at Vaucluse, in the parish of Saint Thomas.
