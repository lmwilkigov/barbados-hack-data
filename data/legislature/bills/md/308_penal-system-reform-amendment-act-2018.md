PENAL SYSTEM REFORM (AMENDMENT) BILL, 2018

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

The Penal System Reform (Amendment) Bill, 2018 would amend the Penal

System Reform Act, Cap. 139 to improve

(a)

the guidelines applicable to the mitigation of an offender’s sentence;
and

(b)

the judicial sentencing guidelines in general.

The sentencing guidelines set out in sections 39 and 41 of the Penal System
Reform  Act,  Cap.  139  applied  to  offences  the  sentencing  for  which  was
discretionary. The new Offences Against the Person (Amendment) Bill, 2018 will
change the status of the sentence for the offence of murder from one that is fixed
by a mandatory sentence to one that is discretionary in nature. Thus the sentence
imposed  for  murder  can  be  tailored  to  fit  the  circumstances  of  the  case  and
individuality  of  the  offender.  As  a  consequence  of  the  aforementioned
amendment, it was determined that it was necessary to amend sections 39 and 41
of the Penal System Reform Act, Cap. 139 to ensure that they apply appropriately
to the offence of murder.

Clause 1:

Clause 2:

Clause 3:

Clause 1 states that the Act should be cited as the Penal System
Reform (Amendment) Act, 2018.

Clause 2 repeals and replaces section 39 of the Penal System
Reform Act, Cap. 139 to provide for the improvement of the
guidelines  applicable  to  the  mitigation  of  an  offender’s
sentence.

Clause 2 repeals and replaces section 41 of the Penal System
Reform Act, Cap. 139 to provide for the improvement of the
general judicial sentencing guidelines.
