1.  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This Green Paper takes note of the immense potential which exists in the field of
sports and identifies challenges which require intervention to allow for optimal
sports development in Barbados.  The paper will seek to demonstrate the issues
and challenges, along with possible solutions which can be implemented through
the creation of a National Sports Policy.

This Green Paper seeks to lay the foundation “to elevate sports as a central pillar
of Barbadian national identity, social development and economic prosperity, by
2032.”

The National Sports Policy should be structured to foster increased participation
in physical activity and sports, as a mechanism for improving health and wellness,
as an access to economic opportunities and to facilitate the pursuit of excellence.
It could be underpinned by the core values of inclusiveness and accessibility; fair
play, respect and ethical behaviour; discipline and dedication, empowerment and
excellence.

The  National  Sports  Policy  should  endeavour  to  build  on  the  existing  sports
culture and on the successes achieved in the numerous sports disciplines over
the  years,  to  enable  Barbados  to  realize  its  full  potential  in  sports.    It  should
specify the direction in which the country must go to optimise its sports related
potential, as articulated in the following objectives:

●  to create an environment in which sport is accessible to all and which
embraces  the  principle  of  inclusion  as  it  relates  to  persons  with
disabilities;

●  to  promote  gender  equality  in  all  aspects  of  sports  participation  and

administration;

●  to promote community development through sports;

●  to stimulate a culture of healthy living and wellness;

●  to  intensify  the  promotion  of  road  tennis  as  the  indigenous  national

sport of Barbados;

●  to empower National Sports Organizations to be greater contributors

to national development;

Ministry of Youth, Sports and Community Empowerment

NATIONAL SPORTS POLICY

Page 4

●  to  promote  the  formulation  of  strategies  and  programmes  that
facilitate the development of athletes, coaches and administrators to
the highest levels;

●  to encourage the full integration of physical education and sports into
the educational curriculum, as well as recreational activities at all levels;

●  to  create  an  awareness  of  sports-oriented  career  opportunities  for

professionals and entrepreneurs;

●  to  encourage  an  inter-sectoral  approach  to  sports  development,

establishing linkages with key sectors and stakeholders;

●  to create an environment that is conducive to maximizing the economic

potential of sports;

●  to package and leverage a “Brand Barbados”, central to which will be

sports;

●  to  position  Barbados  as  a  hosting  nation-of-choice  for  regional  and

international sporting events; and ultimately

●  to transform sports in Barbados to a multifaceted way of life.

The National Sports Policy should seek to educate the general public on the many
opportunities and benefits that are available in and through sports.  Concurrently
it should encourage and promote a positive change of attitude towards assisting
the development of our sports and its practitioners, while seeking to ensure that
sport in Barbados is integrated into the mainstream of our educational, social and
economic life.

The Policy should recognize the pivotal role of the Government of Barbados, in
providing a structured framework within which the efforts of stakeholders may
be  focused.    This  is  reflected  in  the  following  areas  that  are  addressed  in  the
Policy:

  Sports  for  all,  through  facilitation  and  education,  toward  illuminating

sports and accessing the many benefits to be derived;

  the development of a sporting economy;

  the development of a sustainable high-performance system;

Ministry of Youth, Sports and Community Empowerment

NATIONAL SPORTS POLICY

Page 5

  the promotion of institutional strengthening and governance, towards
building  the  capacity  of  the  stakeholders  in  sports  and  attaining  the
sustained development of sports;

  the provision of the necessary enabling infrastructure; and

  the  use  of  financing  and  incentivizing  strategies  with  respect  to
attracting  of  sponsorship  and  investments  and  encouraging  the
efficient management of resources and the attainment of excellence in
sports.

It is essential that there be a legislative and policy environment that embraces
the international sports conventions, treaties and charters to which Barbados is
signatory.  These reflect the globally accepted standards that underpin the policy
and the sports environment that is envisaged for Barbados.

The  Policy  should  highlight  the  need  enact  a  Sports  Development  Act,  to  give
jurisdiction  to  the  measures  and  initiatives  embodied  in  this  National  Sports
Policy.  The Act should provide for the following:

-  a definition of sports;
-
-

the creation of a list of approved sports;
the  waiver  of  duties  on  sports  gear  and  equipment  for  National
Sports Associations and approved sportspersons and organisations;
inequalities  related  to  granting  of
the  removal  of  gender
concessions to athletes;
the  comprehensive  integration  of  physical  activities,  sports  and
related programmes within the education system;
the  inclusion  of  persons  with  disabilities  in  sports  and  physical
activities and programming;
the modernising of the regulatory framework for horse racing;
the  requirement  for  sports  practitioners
in  Barbados  to  be
compliant  with  the  International  Convention  against  Doping  in
Sports  and  the  World  Anti-doping  Code,  and  other  sports  related
Conventions,  Treaties  and  Declaration  to  which  Barbados
is
signatory;
the provision of a new regulatory framework for the National Sports
Council;
the  recognition  of  the  National  Sports  Council  as  Government’s
competent  authority  to  support  the  operations  of  the  National

Page 6

Sports  Organisations,  pursuant  to  the  role  as  provided  for  in  the
legislation governing the National Sports Council;
the  recognition  of  the  Barbados  Olympic  Association  Inc.  as  the
National  Olympic  Committee  for  Barbados  with  responsibility  for
Olympic sports;
 the  recognition  of  the  National  Anti-doping  Commission  as  the
competent authority in Barbados with responsibility for anti-doping
in  sports,  pursuant  to  the  role  as  provided  for  in  the  legislation
governing the National Anti-doping Commission;
the  recognition  of  the  Paralympic  Association of Barbados  as  the
National Paralympic Committee for Barbados with responsibility for
Paralympic sports;
the  conditional  provision  of  incentives  for  major  investments  in
sports and related activities;

-

-

-

-

-  approval for the hosting of international competitions in Barbados;

-

and
the definition and recognition of a sports industry, as an economic
sector.

The effective creation and implementation of the Policy may be realized through
the collaborative efforts of the stakeholders in sports. Hence, the Policy should
emphasise  the  importance  of  the  contribution  of  individuals,  communities,
National Sports Organisations, Corporate Barbados, the Government of Barbados
through  its  Ministries,  Departments  and  Agencies  and,  most  importantly,  all
Barbadians.   It is further proposed that the Policy provide for the strengthening
of the Ministry responsible for Sports and the National Sports Council, to position
these  entities  to  have  oversight  for  the  implementation,  monitoring  and
evaluation of this Policy.

The National Sports Policy should reflect Government’s deliberate commitment
to sports development and development through sports, integral to which is the
development of all Barbadians.  This is indicative that the National Sports Policy
should not be an end in itself, but an essential pathway for the journey of national
development.

2.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE

2.1  Policy Problem

Over the years, Barbadians have viewed sports primarily as an avenue for
leisure, physical exertion and competition, but to a much lesser extent, as
a  tool  for  economic  development.  This  view  has  led  to  an  inability  to
maximize the benefits attained from sports.  It is therefore critical that we
focus on the following:

-
-
-
-

the building of sports as an industry;
the use of sports to foster youth and community development;
tourism diversification through sports; and by extension
the use of sports as a tool for nation building.

Arguments have been advanced that the absence of a well-defined National
Sports Policy for Barbados has inhibited the level of sports development.
Other concerns include:

-

-
-

functional  and  structural  weaknesses  of  numerous  National  Sports
Organisations;
inadequate financing for the development of sports;
the  need  to  restructure  the  education  system  towards  devising  and
implementing  adequate  programmes  for  the  development  of  sports
and sportspersons;

-  an insufficiency of trained instructors, physical education teachers and

coaches;

-  a  lack  of  modern  and  suitably  equipped  sports  facilities  and  the

management thereof;
inadequate recognition and celebration of sports icons;
the absence of a well-defined and focused sports industry. and

the need for a robust governance structure for sports, in general.

-
-

-

It is against the backdrop that this Green Paper on the National Sports Policy
has been formulated.

3.  KEY CONCEPTS AND ISSUES

3.1  Building A More Active Barbados

Sport is an inherent, universal human activity that embraces the interest and
participation  of  people  and  society  at  all  levels.  Its  unique  underpinning
value  has  given  strong  identity  to  a  people  and  has  been  a  tool  for
community  building.  This  has  given  birth  to  the  “Sports-for-All”
methodology,  which  entails  transforming  sports  from  physical  activity
reserved  for  young  and  healthy  persons  into  activity  for  all,  designed  to
improve  health,  mental  and  social  well-being,  stimulate  personal
development and the pursuit of excellence in sports.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) in its Report on Non-communicable
## Diseases (NCD) Country Profiles, 2018i revealed that obesity in Barbados is
on a consistent upward trajectory, which was attributed to inactivity by 44%
of  Barbadians.    Given  the  significant  implications  for  the  prevalence  of
cardiovascular diseases, depression, dementia and other NCDs in Barbados,
a state of affairs exacerbated by the COVID19 pandemic, physical activity by
all  Barbadians  must  be  prioritised  in  the  programmatic  agenda  of  the
Government of Barbados.

As an ideal of Olympism, the “Sports-for-all” concept embraces participation
by all individuals, regardless of age, gender, intellectual or physical abilities,
class or race. The special needs of the elderly and persons with disabilities
must  be  taken  into  account  in  the  implementation  of  any  measures  to
promote a realistic “Sports-for-All” culture.

3.1.1  Sports for Community Development

There is a perception that the implementation of a Community Sports
Strategy  Framework  can  lend  to  support  and  the  development  of  a
robust and consistent community-based sporting programs.  This could
entail partnering with the National Sports organisations, public sector
entities and corporate Barbados, with a view to promoting sport as part
of our national identity.  Support for such programmes and initiatives
can lead to community cohesion, greater resilience against undesirable
social issues.  The issues to be addressed include the need for increased
and  sustained  participation  sports  and  physical  activities  at  the

Ministry of Youth, Sports and Community Empowerment

NATIONAL SPORTS POLICY

Page 9

community  level,  through  improved  access  to  community  sports
facilities and the provision of structured, age-appropriate programmes.

3.1.2  Physical Education, Sports and the Education System

The education system is seen as a vehicle through which children are
introduced to physical education and sports. As such there should be
the full integration of physical education and sports into the curriculum
at all levels of the education system.  This integration would encompass
every  student  from  nursery  to  secondary  school  unless  medically
excused, including those with special needs.  These sport and physical
activity  programmes  could  be  linked  to  values  education,  to  better
equip participants to handle life’s challenges. Essential to the process
will  be  attaining  a  better  understanding  of  the  impact  of  integrating
physical education and sports in early childhood education.

3.1.3  Sports and Healthy Living

The projected trajectory of increase obesity attributed to inactivity by
some  Barbadians,  can  significantly  impact  the  prevalence  of  physical
and  mental  NCDs  in  Barbados.  Increased  participation  in  physical
activity and sports by Barbadians offers a solution to reducing this trend
and can be conducive to the enhanced physical and mental health and
wellness of the nation.

3.1.4  Gender Diversity & Equality

Globally, there is a strategic thrust to attain gender equity and diversity
in all areas of sports. Efforts in this regard include the empowering both
males and females at all levels of sports, through specific training and
development  programmes  that
includes  governance-related  and
technical training.

3.1.5  Sports and Penitentiary reform

Sports can be a vehicle for the positive rehabilitation for residents of
the  state  towards,  with  a  view  of  reducing  the  level  of  recidivism,
strengthening the prison reform and enhancing the physical and mental
wellness of the participants.  Of emphasis should be a sports program

Ministry of Youth, Sports and Community Empowerment

NATIONAL SPORTS POLICY

Page 10

that caters to juvenile detainees,  to enable the early intervening and
altering of the pathways for young residents of the state.

3.2  Development of a Sports Economy

Sports  globally  is  a  lucrative  business,  with  the  industry  estimated  to  be
## worth  between  $489  to  $614  billionii.  In  light  of  this  commercial  value  of
sports, there has been much public discourse on the potential for developing
a sustainable, and diverse sports industry for Barbados.

Several elements for such an industry exist in Barbados, albeit many of which
are in an embryonic stage relative to those in the regional and international
arenas. these elements comprise but are not limited to  being engaged as
athletes,  sports  management  including  being  a  sports  agent,  sports
administration,  volunteerism,  sports  manufacturing,  sport  merchandising
and retailing, advertising, spectating, sports tourism, semi-professional and
professional sports, the provision of facilities, coaching, sports research and
development, sport-related gaming, health and fitness, sports medicine and
sports journalism and broadcasting.

These presents career opportunities in the full spectrum of sport business
and for commercial exploitation of sports events and sports related products
and services, including those that are technology based.

3.2.1  Sports and National Development

As a starting point for advancing sports as an industry, it is necessary to
determine  the  contribution  of  sports  to  national  development  in
Barbados. This should include attaining an understanding of the current
investment in sports in Barbados, the benefits derived from sports and
a better understanding of the social and economic value of sports to
Barbados.  This  may  inform  evidence-based  decision  making  and
planning towards repositioning Barbados and Barbadians in the global
sports market.

3.2.2  Community, Youth and Elite Sports

Sport may be utilized as a vehicle for social mobilization and economic
development at the community level, for the youth and elite athletes,
with a view to opening opportunities for them to generate income and

Ministry of Youth, Sports and Community Empowerment

NATIONAL SPORTS POLICY

Page 11

to  self-actualise.  There  is  also  the  recognition  that  sports  motivate
young people to be active and can redound to them achieving better
results at school, acquiring the early foundation of skills and habits that
help them remain healthy and have productive lives.

3.2.3  Professional Sports

Sportsmen  and  women  fall  into  the  category  of  global  professionals,
some of whom are the highest paid practitioners the world over. The
development  of  semi-professional  and  professional  sports  leagues  in
Barbados  can  present  an
intermediate  pathway  through  which
Barbadian  sportspersons  can  hone  their  skills  and  positioning
themselves to be global sports professionals. Such leagues can attract
increased  corporate  support  locally,  as  well  as  capture  international
media attention and the associated global audiences.

3.2.4  Sports Tourism

The  development  of  a  sustainable  sports  tourism  package  can  be  a
viable option for enhancing our tourism product offering and as a major
economic growth strategy for Barbados. This could include establishing
Barbados  as  a  leading  destination  for  regional  and  international
tournaments,  training  camps,  sporting  exhibitions  and  sports
conferences.  There is also the opportunity to build on our global image
as  a  caring  nation  and  an  ideal  destination  for  relaxation,  as  well  as
leverage  its  historical  investment  in  our  health  sector,  to  establish
Barbados as a regional hub for sports sciences and a premier location
for sports injury care and rehabilitation.

3.2.5  Sports Manufacturing

Inherent to the proposed formalizing of a sports industry in Barbados is
the  opportunity  to  establish  an  environment  that  encourages
investment in sports manufacturing locally.  The starting point can be
the positioning of Barbados as the key distributor of equipment related
to our indigenous, bona fide sport, road tennis, and the manufacturing
of ancillary products for mainstream sports, including cricket, for the
domestic and export markets.

Ministry of Youth, Sports and Community Empowerment

NATIONAL SPORTS POLICY

Page 12

3.2.6  Intellectual Property and Sports

The growth and development of sport in Barbados will be accompanied
by  the  increased  attractiveness  of  its  commercial  value.    It  will  be
necessary therefore to ensure the maintenance of a robust legal and
policy framework for the protection of Intellectual Property Rights, to
facilitating  the  monetizing  of  intellectual  property  assets  and  to
promote public awareness and the building of respect for Intellectual
Property Rights in sports.

3.2.7  Broadcast and other Media Rights

The  involvement  in  sports  by  sponsors,  sports  practitioners  and
especially the local and international media may be influenced by the
perceived attractiveness of so doing. This appeal may be enhanced by
the packaging and promotion of Barbados’ sports product, infused with
Barbadian  information  and  culture,  to  encourage  mutually  beneficial
partnerships with these stakeholders.

3.2.8  Sports and the Environment

The use of public spaces, including the sea, beaches, gullies, hills and
parks for physical activities and sports, offers an inexpensive solution to
the  growing  demand  for  sport  facilities.  This  is  augmented  by  the
rapidly  increasing  global  interest  in  outdoor  and  beach  sports.  The
growing interest in sports can used as a platform to implement public
awareness programmes that focus on issues pertaining to sports and
the natural environment, including the preservation of the beaches and
public spaces in Barbados, to influence positive environmental changes.
This can include the reduction of energy costs and carbon emissions, by
engaging  renewable  energy  solutions  for  sports  facilities,  structures
and equipment.

3.2.9  Volunteers

Sports  in  Barbados  is  underpinned  by  the  spirit  of  volunteerism,  a
mechanism through which persons may be trained in the elements of
sports  event  coordination  and  management.  The  skills  acquired  are
transferrable and hence, the sports community should be encouraged

Ministry of Youth, Sports and Community Empowerment

NATIONAL SPORTS POLICY

Page 13

to  prioritise  volunteerism  as  a  tool  to  augment  the  foundation  of  a
trained workforce for Barbados.

3.2.10  The Digital Sports Sector

Digital Technology in sports is a big and rapidly evolving business, where
a growing number of persons globally use technology with some form
of sports. This ranges from apps that facilitate or track training and the
vital signs of participants, internet platforms for the sharing of sports
related  content  and  doing  sports  related  business  and  e-sports,  to
television  and  on-line  viewing  of  local,  regional  and  international
competitions.   Inherent to the digital sports sector are the essential
sports  marketing  and  the  lucrative  media  rights.    The  transition  to  a
digitally ready sports sector will necessitate a review of the policy and
regulatory  framework  that  governs  activities
in  some  sporting
disciplines, including horseracing.

3.2.11 Areas of Special Interest

There are some sporting disciplines to which special attention must be
afforded,  given  their  critical  role  in  the  socio-cultural  and  economic
development  of  Barbados.  Foremost  of  these  sports  are  cricket  and
road tennis.

3.2.12 Cricket Development

Barbadians per capita have done better in cricket than any other nation
on  earth  and  hence,  cricket  may  be  considered  to  be  a  symbol  and
model of national excellence in Barbados.  Moreover, geographic and
population  size  have  not  been  impediments  to  Barbadians  achieving
global excellence in cricket.   As in commerce, cricket can be considered
our lead sport product.  It is essential therefore that Barbados capitalize
on its cricket related investment, infrastructure and human capital and
successes,  to  ensure  sustained  success  in  the  sport  and  to  lead  the
further development of its sports industry.

Ministry of Youth, Sports and Community Empowerment

NATIONAL SPORTS POLICY

Page 14

3.2.13 Road Tennis Development

Road tennis is the only indigenous sport of Barbados and hence, it is
intrinsically linked to the Barbadian culture.  Special emphasis must be
placed on initiatives to advance this sport, as it is a mechanism for living
a healthy lifestyle and it has the capacity to afford our young men and
women  careers  in  sports,  locally  and  internationally,  as  well  as  to
enhance their social and personal development.

These  efforts  should  include  building  capacity  and  encouraging
participation  at  the  community  level,  the  adoption  of  a  scientific
approach  to  enhancing  the  game,  positioning  Barbados  as  the  key
distributor of equipment and supplies related to road tennis, and as a
source of professionals for developing the sport at all levels.

3.2.14 Beach Culture and Sport

Barbados  is  surrounded  by  beautiful  beaches,  which  can  be  better
utilized to enhance the sporting landscape and sports tourism product
offering  of  the  island.  These  beaches  are  an  element  of  natural
infrastructure  and  an  integral  part  of  Barbados’  cultural  envelope.
Hence,  efforts  should  be  made  to  create  a  synergy  among  the  sand,
ocean, communities, and the many sports that currently utilize or can
be adapted to utilize the sea and beaches. This enhanced beach culture
presents opportunities for increased sports tourism, job creation and
the development of neighboring communities and their residents.

3.2.15 Disciplines for Primary Focus

There  is  a  need  to  allocate  resources  to  sporting  disciplines  and
encourage them to facilitate mass recreational participation, as well as
competitive pursuits where applicable.  Beyond the special interest in
cricket and road tennis however, there are other disciplines that may
be emphasized, given their history of development and contribution to
assisting
in  the  country’s  socio-economic  development.  Specific
variables that determine which of the disciplines should be singled out
for specific increased national resource investment and attention are:

  national  historical  and  traditional  exposure  to  and  investment  in  the

discipline;

Ministry of Youth, Sports and Community Empowerment

NATIONAL SPORTS POLICY

Page 15

  percentage of the populace practicing the sport at the recreational and

competitive levels;

  potential  for  enhanced  measurable  national  social  and  economic

contribution;

  existing adequate infrastructure for the practice of the discipline;
  potential for international exposure and or expansion;
  existing adequate proponents and or technically competent exponents



of the discipline;
the  combining  of  proven  existing  national  physical  and  mental
competencies of the majority of the populace; and
  consistent regional and international success.

3.3  Hosting of Regional and International Events

Barbados  has  been  recognised  for  its  successful  hosting  of  numerous
regional  and  international  sporting  events,  which  has  showcased  our
expertise in event management and our culture and way of life. The hosting
of these events constitutes a sound strategy  for economic diversification,
its  ability  to  generate  tourism  and  small  business  revenue,
given
entrepreneurship and in general, the development of sports as a productive
sector.  Another primary beneficiary is the services sector, as the successful
hosting of such events entails a fusion of many local services.

3.4  Development of a High-Performance System

In  the  past,  Barbados  had  set  a  benchmark  for  the  achievement  of  high-
performance  outcomes.  Notwithstanding  that  our  competitors  have
improved significantly, we have not kept pace with global developments and
hence, Barbados has been achieving fewer medals on the world stage and
our  international  rankings  in  many  sports  have  dwindled.  While  the
achievement of medals remains a priority, there is the need to redefine the
successes  of  elite  athletes  to  include  their  impact  as  role  models,  their
engagement  at  the  community  level  toward  encouraging  persons  to
participate in sports and lead healthier lifestyles, their contribution to the
development of the sports industry and as global citizens.

The development of a technology infused national high-performance system
is  therefore  a  necessary  task,  which  once  embraced  and  nurtured,  can
redound  to  considerable  benefits  and  the  overall  sustained  growth  and
advancement of sports in Barbados. This will provide aspiring and current

Ministry of Youth, Sports and Community Empowerment

NATIONAL SPORTS POLICY

Page 16

athletes with established pathways towards achieving their best during and
after their careers.

3.4.1  National Development Scholarships

The building of Barbados’ sports related expert capacity is necessary, to
provide  Barbados  with  a  comparative  advantage  with  respect  to  the
international sporting community.  This may be achieved through the
provision of National Development Scholarships in key areas of sports.

3.4.2  Specialists’ Sports Centre

The  international  competitiveness  of  Barbados  may  be  enhanced
through  the  establishment  of  a  Specialists’  Sports  Centre,  a  national
coaching  structure  and  the  recruitment  and  training  of  high-calibre
sports  personnel.  This  approach  can  be  strengthened  through  a
collaboration with the School of Sports, Cave Hill Campus and other key
sports  sciences  and  medical  stakeholders,  to  ensure  that  any
performance  issues  are  addressed  through  research,  technology  and
innovation and that sports science is infused into our sports disciplines.

3.4.3  Investment and Resource Allocation

In light of the limited resources that are available to the development
of sports, there is a need for the Government of Barbados through the
National Sports Council, Barbados Olympic Association and other key
investment  and
stakeholders  to  collaborate  towards  optimising
resource  allocation  in  support  of  our  athletes  achieving  better
performance outcomes.

3.4.4  Regional and International Cooperation

Sports can be utilized as a vehicle for enhancing cooperation and the
leveraging  of  expertise  at  the  local,  regional  and  international  levels,
the outcome of which can be conducive to national development, and
a competitive edge for our athletes and their performance.

Ministry of Youth, Sports and Community Empowerment

3.4.5  Athlete Centric Holistic Development

The  holistic  development  of  Barbadian  athlete
is  of  primary
importance, to include skills for remaining healthy, as well as life skills
to  navigate  inside  and  outside  of  the  elite  sports  environment,  and
professional development in career and education.

3.4.6  Academic and Vocational Training

The elite athletes and officials who represent Barbados do so with much
sacrifice of their time and alternative careers. These role models should
be  afforded  the  opportunity  to  undertake  academic  and  vocational
training  at  tertiary  institutions,  provided  the  minimum  required
standard for matriculation is achieved.

3.4.7  Athletes as model Citizens

Sportspersons  may  be  viewed  as  highly  disciplined  and  focused
individuals,  with  the  potential  to  positively  impact  the  Barbadian
society.  Strategies  should  be  implemented  through  which  such
sportspersons can advance their performances as effective role models
and as positive influences on our communities.

3.5  Maintaining the Integrity of Sports

Barbados  is  signatory  to  the  International  Convention  Against  Doping  in
Sports and the Olympic Charter, which provides for a sports environment
that is fair, safe and  inclusive, as well as proactively identify,  remedy and
deter any threats to the integrity of sports and the safety of our athletes,
support and accompanying personnel.  The preservation of the integrity of
sports, including against match fixing and exploitation should be supported
by the appropriate a legislative framework.

3.6  Institutional Strengthening and Governance

In order for the Barbadian sporting ecosystem to thrive and be conducive to
success in the global sporting environment, our process of transformation
demands greater global alignment.  The institutional strengthening of  our

Ministry of Youth, Sports and Community Empowerment

NATIONAL SPORTS POLICY

Page 18

National  Sporting  Organisations  is  now  more  critical  than  ever,  as  it  will
provide the opportunity for our National Organisations to create sustainable
development  frameworks  towards  optimising  their  efficiencies  and
positioning our athletes to attain sustained excellence.

Such  support  may  be  delivered  through  a  strengthened  and  rebranded
National Sports Council and may include assistance with the arbitration of
disputes,  capacity  building
in  the  areas  of  governance,  operational
alignment  towards  excellence,  the  implementation  of  child  safeguarding
policies and inclusivity to embrace the differently abled and marginalized.

3.7  Infrastructural Development

Infrastructural  development  is  critical  for  the  promotion  of  public  and
community-oriented participation in sport and recreational activity. It is also
essential to the achievement of high-performance objectives and standards
in  sport.    Greater  emphasis  must  also  be  placed  on  creating  access  for
disability sports through systematic upgrades to the existing facilities, and to
positioning Barbados as an inclusive sports tourism destination.

This investment can help to ensure quality sporting experiences for all adults
and  children  participating  in  sport  regularly,  as  well  as  assist  our  top
sportspersons towards competing successfully at the highest levels.

3.8  Financing and Incentivizing

There is a general acknowledgement that the development of sports can be
a  costly  undertaking.    Sponsorship,  philanthropic  contributions,  self-help
and prudent management of resources are essential, in order to achieve the
desired successes in sports. This may be assisted through the formation of
public-private sector partnerships, as a means to maintaining and expanding
the  facilities  available  for  sports,  as  well  as  encouraging  collaborations
between the National Federation and the private sector.

3.8.1  Incentives and Concessions

It is imperative that there be stimuli to encourage contributions to the
development of sports and to motivate individuals to perform at the
highest  levels.    Such  stimuli  may  include  duty-free  concessions  on
imports for National Sports Organisations and approved sportspersons,
exemptions  from  the  payment  of  taxes  pertaining  to  undertaking
approved sports projects and competitions, appropriate incentives for

Ministry of Youth, Sports and Community Empowerment

NATIONAL SPORTS POLICY

Page 19

persons  or  entities  who  undertake  the  construction,  refurbishing,
furnishing  and  operation  of  a  sports  related  facility,  the  release  of
employees  for  training  and  to  represent  Barbados  in  sports  without
them being disadvantaged, and the creation of a national recognition
mechanism that highlights, rewards and engages outstanding national
sportspersons.

3.9  Legislation

A  robust  legislative  framework  built  on  globally  accepted  standards  is  a
necessary underpinning of an effective policy and sports environment.  This
would include local legislation to fully enable and support the objectives of
the policy.

4.  SPORTS DEVELOPMENT ACT
The enactment of a Sports Development Act will be required, to give jurisdiction
to the measures and initiatives embodied in the National Sports Policy.  Inter alia,
this Act should be conducive to the strengthening of the state entities to better
facilitate the development of sports as a true economic earning sector and as a
social development mechanism.  It is proposed that the Sports Development Act
provide for the following:

-  a definition of sports;
-
-

-

-

-

the creation of a list of approved sports;
the waiver of duties on sports gear and equipment for National Sports
Associations and approved sportspersons and organisations;
the removal of gender inequalities related to granting of concessions to
athletes;
the comprehensive integration of physical activities, sports and related
programmes within the education system;
the inclusion of persons with disabilities in sports and physical activities
and programming;
the modernising of the regulatory framework for horse racing;

-
-  sports practitioners in Barbados to be compliant with the International
Convention against Doping in Sports and the World Anti-doping Code,
and  other  sports  related  Conventions,  Treaties  and  Declaration  to
which Barbados is signatory;
the  provision  of  a  new  regulatory  framework  for  the National Sports
Council;

-

the  recognition  of  the  National  Sports  Council  as  Government’s
competent authority to support the operations of the National Sports
Organisations,  pursuant  to  the  role  as  provided  for  in  the  legislation
governing the National Sports Council;
the  recognition  of  the  Barbados  Olympic  Association  Inc.  as  the
National  Olympic  Committee  for  Barbados  with  responsibility  for

competent authority in Barbados with responsibility for anti-doping in
sports, pursuant to the role as provided for in the legislation governing

National  Paralympic  Committee  for  Barbados  with  responsibility  for
Paralympic sports;
the  conditional  provision  of  incentives  for  investments  in  sports  and
related activities;

-  approval  for  the  hosting  of  international  sports  competitions  in

sector.

5.  POLICY DIRECTION AND VISION FOR SPORTS

The vision of the proposed National Sports Policy is:

To elevate sports as a central pillar of Barbadian national identity, social
development and economic prosperity, by 2032.

5.1  The Guiding Values

It is proposed that the policy is underpinned by a set of core values, which

6.  POLICY IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION

The  implementation  of  a  National  Sports  Policy  for  Barbados  will  require  the
participation  and  cooperation  of  the  Government  of  Barbados,  through  its
Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), integral to which will be an Inter-
Ministerial  Committee  on  Sports  that  focuses  on  achieving  synergies,  greater
efficiency and effectiveness with respect to the implementation of the policy by
the ministerial stakeholders.  The implementation of the Policy will  also entail
collaborations  with  the  private  sector,  sporting  organisations,  educational
institutions and community-based organizations.

Policy  monitoring  and  evaluation  are  key  functions  to  assist  in  achieving  the
expected results of the National Sports Policy.  The purpose is to track changes
and  explain  why  change  may  or  may  not  be  occurring.  The  monitoring  and
evaluation  process  may  be  guided  by  a  number  of  performance  indicators,
particularly regarding participation and success of the policy at all levels. Annual
reviews should be conducted to assess the effectiveness of the implementation
of  those  initiatives  that  are  highlighted  within  the  annual  strategic  and
operational plans of the Ministry responsible for Sports and other stakeholders.

A mid-term review and evaluation should be undertaken after five (5) years, in an
effort  to  inform  the  long-term  objectives.  This  will  allow  for  any  necessary
modification of the strategic direction of the policy, emanating from any changes
in national or global environment.

7.  CONCLUSION

The proposed creation of a National Sports Policy is geared towards consolidating
the diverse efforts of stakeholders in sports in Barbados, while strengthening the
capacity  of  the  sports  sector  to  develop  elite  athletes,  encouraging  increased
participation nationally and to stimulating the further development of sports as
a productive sector.

The Policy should seek to capitalize on the synergies of the stakeholders, thus
fueling  creativity  and  innovation.  It  should  further  promote  the  fostering  of
linkages with business entities beyond the traditional sports system in Barbados
and hence, offer the opportunity to enhance the resources available for sports.

It  is  envisaged  that  these  objectives  of  the  Policy  could  be  realized  through  a
concerted  and  collaborative  effort  by  the  Government  of  Barbados,  its  non-
governmental  partners  and  most  importantly,  all  Barbadians,  the  ultimate
beneficiaries of the policy.

Annex 3 - The Inter-Ministerial Committee on Sports – Terms of Reference

Objective

In light of the cross-sectoral impact of sports and the implications of the National Sports
Policy  for  the  stakeholder  ministries,  an  Inter-Ministerial  Committee  on  Sports  will  be
established to facilitate the implementation of the relevant aspects of the Policy by the
respective  Ministries.  The  Inter-Ministerial  Committee  on  Sports  will  also  work  towards
achieving synergies and greater efficiency and effectiveness with respect to the application
