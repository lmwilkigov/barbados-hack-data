licensed operator in order to transfer the operations.

(2)

Where the Minister is satisfied that the licensed operator is able

(a)

to discharge all of its obligations under the agreement entered
into with the Company; and

(b)

to undertake the transferred operations,

the  Minister  may  by  order  give  permission  for  the  transfer  of  the

right or interest referred to in subsection (1) shall revert to the Company.

6

No transfer of an interest or right referred to in subsection (1)

(4)
shall

(a)

operate  as  a  breach  of  covenant  or  condition  against
alienation;

give rise to forfeiture; or

(c)

invalidate or discharge a contract or security.

(5)

Subject to subsection (1), where the operations are transferred

(a)

every contract to which the Company is a party shall, from
the date of the transfer, be construed as if

(ii)

(iii)

the licensed operator had been a party thereto instead
of the Company;

for  a  reference  to  the  Company,  there  had  been
substituted, in respect of anything falling to be done on
or  after  the  date  of  the  transfer,  a  reference  to  the
licensed operator; and

for a reference to any director, officer, servant or agent
of the Company, there had been substituted in respect
of anything falling to be done on or after the date of the
transfer,  a  reference  to  the  directors  of  the  licensed
operator or, as the case may be, to such director, officer,
servant or agent of the licensed operator as the licensed
operator may appoint, or, in default of appointment, to
the  director,  officer,  clerk  or  servant  of  the  licensed
operator  corresponding,  as  nearly  as  may  be,  to  any
director, officer, servant or agent of the Company; and

(b)

any debts or other claims between the Company and a third
party  shall  be  construed  as  debts  or  other  claims  of  the

is expressed to be

(i)

drawn on;

(ii)

given to;

subparagraphs  (i)  to  (iv)  had  been  taken  by  the  licensed
operator;

any  security  transferred  to  the  licensed  operator  that
immediately before the date of the transfer was held by the
Company  as  security  for  the  payment  or  discharge  of  any
debt, liability or obligation, whether present or future, actual
or contingent, shall be held by and shall be available to the
licensed operator as security for the payment or discharge of
such debt, liability or obligation;

any  security  transferred  to  the  licensed  operator  that
immediately before the date of the transfer was held by the
Company  as  security  for  the  payment  or  discharge  of  any
debt, liability or obligation, whether present or future, actual
or contingent, that extends to future advances or liabilities
shall, from the date of the transfer, be held by and shall be
available  to  the  licensed  operator  as  security  for  future
advances by, and future liabilities to the licensed operator in
the same manner and in all respects as future advances by or
liabilities  to  the  Company  secured  thereby  immediately
before the date of the transfer;

(f)

any judgment or award obtained by, or against, the Company
and not fully satisfied before the date of the transfer shall be
enforceable by or against the licensed operator; and

8

(g)

unless an agreement by the parties to the transfer provides to
the  contrary,  any  officer,  or  person  employed  by  the
Company immediately before the date of the transfer, shall
be an officer or employee, as the case may be, of the licensed
operator  on  terms  and  conditions  no  less  favourable  than
those on which he was so employed immediately before the
date of the transfer, and such employment with the Company
and licensed operator respectively shall be deemed, for all
purposes, to be a single continuous period of employment,
but no director, secretary or auditor of the Company shall by
virtue  only  of  a  vesting  order  be  a  director,  secretary  or
auditor, as the case may be, of the licensed operator.

immediately before the date of the transfer were held by the Company,
