PENAL SYSTEM REFORM (AMENDMENT) BILL, 2014

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

In light of the decision of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in Case

12645: Tyrone Dacosta Cadagon v. Barbados, the Cabinet1 determined that

(a)

(b)

the mandatory imposition of death penalty in respect of the offence of
murder should be abolished; and

section 2 of the Offences Against the Person Act, Cap. 141 be amended
specifically  to  abolish  the  mandatory  imposition  of  the  sentence  of
death for offence of murder; and

It has been determined that section 26 of the Constitution will not be repealed

at this time.

It is important to note that the Cabinet did not express any intention to abolish

the death penalty.

In order to facilitate the decision made by the Cabinet and, in particular, to
lend support to the new sentencing guidelines for the offence of murder under
the new Offences Against the Person (Amendment) Bill, 2014, it was determined
that it was necessary to amend sections 39 and 41 of the Penal System Reform
Act, Cap. 139.

The Penal System Reform Act applies generally to offences, the sentencing for
which  is  discretionary  in  nature,  in  that  a  Judge  has  discretion  to  impose  a
sentence which addresses the specific circumstances of the offender and the case.
Section  39  which  deals  with  the  consideration  of  mitigating  circumstances  in
relation  to  sentencing  offenders  and  section  41  which  deals  with  judicial
sentencing guidelines, allows judges to facilitate that discretion.

The new Offences Against the Person (Amendment) Bill, 2014 has changed
the status of the sentence for the offence of murder from one that is fixed by a
mandatory sentence to one that is discretionary in nature, where the sentence can

(AMENDMENT) BILL, 2014

be tailored to fit the circumstances of the case and individuality of the offender.
Thus it is forseen that sections 39 and 41 of the Penal System Reform Act would
now as a result of the Offences Against the Person (Amendment) Bill, 2014 apply
to the offence of murder.

The Inter-American Court of Human Rights in Case 12645: Tyrone Dacosta
Cadagon v. Barbados also emphasised the fact that a sentence that is applicable
to  the  offence  of  murder  must  be  individualized  to  address  the  particular
circumstances of the offence and the offender.2 Sections 39 and 41 of the Penal
System Reform Act were amended to improve the guidelines for sentencing and
thereby better facilitating the decision of the Inter-American Court.

In summary, the Penal System Reform (Amendment) Bill, 2014 would amend

the Penal System Reform Act, Cap. 139 to improve

(a)

the guidelines applicable to the mitigation of an offender’s sentence;
and

(b)

the judicial sentencing guidelines in general.

Clause 1:

Clause 2:

Clause 3:

Clause 1 states that the Act should be cited as the Penal System
Reform (Amendment) Act, 2014.

Clause 2 repeals and replaces section 39 of the Penal System
Reform Act, Cap. 139 to provide for the improvement of the
guidelines  applicable  to  the  mitigation  of  an  offender’s
sentence.

Clause 2 repeals and replaces section 41 of the Penal System
Reform Act, Cap. 139 to provide for the improvement of the
general judicial sentencing guidelines.
