and has undertaken in a separate agreement to give further assistance;
or

the  convicted  person  did  not  receive  a  reduced  sentence,  but

connection with the investigation or prosecution of an offence.

In reviewing a sentence under subsection (1), the Court that entered the
(3)
original sentence shall have regard to the extent and nature of the assistance given
or offered.

Power to reduce penalties for assistance rendered to the State

A Judge may impose a lesser sentence than the Judge would otherwise
29.(1)
impose on an accused person having regard to the degree to which the accused
person has assisted, or undertaken to assist, the State in the prevention, detection
or investigation of, or in State proceedings relating to, the offence concerned or
any other offence, and having regard to the matters set out in subsection (2).

19

(2)
In  deciding  whether  to  impose  a  lesser  sentence  for  an  offence  and  the
nature  and  extent  of  the  sentence  he  imposes,  the  Judge  shall  consider  the
following matters

(a)

(b)

(c)

the significance and usefulness of the accused person's assistance to
the State concerned, taking into consideration any evaluation by the
State of the assistance rendered or undertaken to be rendered;

the  truthfulness,  completeness  and  reliability  of  any  information  or
evidence provided by the accused person;

the nature and extent of the accused person's assistance or promised
assistance;

(f)

(g)

(h)

(i)

(j)

any  injury  suffered  by  the  accused  person  or  the  accused  person's
family, or any danger or risk of injury to the accused person or the
accused person's family, resulting from the assistance or undertaking
to assist;

whether the assistance or promised assistance concerns the offence for
which the accused person is being sentenced or an unrelated offence;

whether the accused person has agreed to compensate the victim; and

whether the accused person offers to plead guilty soon after he has been
charged or at the earliest possible time after the investigator's file is
completed.

20

A Judge that imposes a lesser sentence under this section on an accused

(3)
person because the accused person has assisted, or undertaken to assist, shall

(a)

indicate to the accused person and may make a record of the fact, that
the lesser sentence is being imposed because the accused person has
assisted, or undertaken to assist, the State, in the prevention, detection
or investigation of, or in proceedings relating to, the offence concerned
or any other offence; and

(b)

state the sentence that it would otherwise have imposed.

Subsection (3) does not limit any requirement that a Judge has, apart from

(4)
that subsection, to record the reasons for his decisions.

The failure of a Judge to comply with the requirements of subsection (3)

(5)
with respect to any sentence does not invalidate the sentence.

breached the terms of the plea agreement; or

it was entered into as a result of a misrepresentation or misapprehension
as to the substance or consequences of the plea agreement.

The Director of Public Prosecutions is entitled to withdraw from a plea

agreement before sentence where the Director of Public Prosecutions is satisfied
that he was

(a)

(b)

in  the  course  of  plea  negotiations,  misled  by  the  accused  or  by  his
attorney-at-law in some material respect; or

induced to conclude the plea agreement by conduct amounting to an
obstruction of justice.

21

misled by the accused person or his attorney-at-law in some material
respect;
