CHARTER OF BARBADOS 2021

WE, THE PEOPLE OF BARBADOS, in this 55th year of our constitutional
independence,  reaffirming  our  commitment  to  the  fundamental  rights  and
freedoms  won  by  those  who  came  before  us,  vow  to  safeguard  these
achievements for all Barbadians and make the solemn pledge in this Charter of
Barbados:

PREAMBLE

UNDERSCORING the sanctity of the pledges we make to one another to ensure
a  peaceful,  just  and  equitable  Barbados  whose  wellbeing  is  grounded  in  the
enfranchisement of all citizens;

RECOGNISING that we are entering into a new chapter of our Independence,
having taken the decisive step of choosing a Barbadian as our Head of State and
intent on crafting our own Barbadian Constitution;

UNRELENTING in our support for a democracy in which the sovereign power
resides  in  the  people  in  whose  name  and  for  whose  benefit  the  powers  of
Government are to be exercised;

RECOGNISING this land, its surrounding waters and its peoples as the uniquely
unifying elements that nurture the soul of our Bajan society;

CELEBRATING with gratitude the indigenous inhabitants of this island, then
known as Ichirouganaim, and vowing to honour their memories and preserve
the material evidence of their civilisation in our possession;

RECALLING the different journeys and diverse motives of our ancestors, some
arriving to this land in search of new frontiers and exploits; most by compulsion
and against their will, the vast majority of whom were uprooted from Africa,
and having survived the horrors of the Middle Passage were condemned to toil
under mass enslavement, one of the greatest crimes against humanity;

EMBRACING our diversity while acknowledging we are one people bound by
love, respect and a duty of care for one another and our kinship as Barbadians.

3

UNDERSCORING the fact that we are all equal by virtue of our humanity, in
the eyes of the Creator and according to the laws of this land, regardless of our
ancestry:

CONSCIOUS that the work of dismantling past and present inequities, and the
building  and  sustaining  of  strong  communities  in  their  place  requires  us  to
confront legislatively, morally and sensibly, the problems and difficulties faced
by our most vulnerable citizens through our daily choices and actions;

APPRECIATING the legacy of all those numerous Barbadians whose actions
distinguished them as true patriots and whose lives of achievement and service
enrich our history and continue as examples for us to follow;

CHERISHING the foresight of the Fathers of our Democracy and Independence,
in securing our right to vote, so that we may claim our destiny as an independent
nation that affirms the principle that we shall be “friends of all and satellites of
none”;

CONVINCED  of  the  critical  role  the  further  integration  and  unity  of  our
Caribbean community must play in fostering closer ties within our hemisphere
and peace and friendship with all the peoples of the world;

TAKING  INTO  ACCOUNT  the  growing  interdependence  of  the  global
community,  and  the  international  collaboration  necessary  for  solving  our
greatest challenges;

And REAFFIRMING our solidarity in the vision of a truly free, independent,
fair and just Barbados for all;

RESOLVE to adopt the following:

THE CHARTER OF BARBADOS

Article I

All Barbadians are born free and are equal in human dignity and rights
regardless  of  age,  race,  ethnicity,  faith,  class,  cultural  and  educational
background, ability, sex, gender or sexual orientation.

4

HUMAN RIGHTS

We must always remember the courageous and long struggle of the indigenous
peoples of our region and of our enslaved African ancestors who fought against
the oppressive and inhumane institution of slavery in which this country was
settled.    We  are  grateful  for  the  legacy,  bequeathed  to  us,  of  their  cultural,
artistic,  entrepreneurial,  and  scientific  achievements  carved  out  of  the  bleak
wasteland that was colonisation and slavery.

Our  people  have  survived  the  trauma  of  enslavement  and  many  withstood
extreme brutality so we will never forget that freedom and equality are the most
fundamental  features  of  our  national  identity.    We  therefore  reject,  in  our
community,  all  forms  of  oppression,  intolerance,  discrimination  and  abuse,
whether  economic,  mental,  verbal or  physical  and  we  commit  to  healing  this
nation and its people from the shame, pain and injustice of slavery on which it
was founded;

TOWARDS A JUST SOCIETY

We  commemorate  the  courage  and  sacrifice  of  all  those  who,  through  the
centuries, fought for freedom and justice, especially those who took part in the
rebellions of 1675 and 1816 which were instrumental to the emancipation of the
enslaved in 1834; and those of 1876 and 1937.

We recognise the contribution of those who came to our shores as indentured
servants from Britain and Ireland and all those who followed later under other
circumstances from Asia, Europe and other parts of the world.

We commit to working in good faith to heal the wounds inflicted on our people
through centuries of enslavement, racism and oppression, in order to reconcile
the fractures such inhumanity produced, and to seek reparatory justice and the
economic enfranchisement of the systemically oppressed.

We reflect the intent and spirit to define our national identity and to guide our
conduct  towards  the  realization  of  our  social  vision.    This  vision  entails  the
creation of a truly just and fair society in which all citizens can find personal
and  collective  satisfaction  through  empowerment,  in  order  to  develop  their
individual talents to the fullest benefit of our nation.

5

DIVERSITY

We acknowledge the multi-faith heritage of our society, and we appreciate the
value  added  to our religious  and spiritual  culture by  the  diversity  of  all  faith
communities and spiritual entities, and their continuing capacity to have a strong
and lasting influence on the quality of life in Barbados.

We value the cultural diversity brought to our shores by those people who were
uprooted  or  those  who  arrived  from  near  and  distant  lands  for  religious,
economic and other varying reasons.  Together we stand proudly as an integral
part of the Caribbean civilisation that has given vibrancy to our own national
identity.

We  recognise  the  many  ways  in  which  languages  and  cultures  were  used
historically as tools to separate the peoples of the Caribbean.  We commit to
strengthening  our  connections  throughout  our  region  and  the  wider  world
through  learning  and  embracing  the  many  languages  represented.    We
acknowledge  that  language  cannot  be  separated  from  the  values  of  respect,
tolerance and cooperation, and are germane to the national vision of nurturing
global citizens with Barbadian roots.

Article II

Everyone in Barbados has a duty to care for each other and to ensure that
our  relationships  are  at  all  times  characterized  by  courtesy,  civility  and
mutual respect.  We remain conscious that every generation is indebted to
those generations that preceded it and is morally obligated to the one that
follows.

RESPECT

We  commit  to  resolve  our  conflicts  in  the  spirit  of  tolerance,  respect  and
acceptance of the diversity found amongst persons and within institutions.

We pledge to forge a more humane and inclusive society based on the principles
of love and respect for our fellow man and understanding that our differences
contribute to making us who we are.

6

We affirm that our single greatest responsibility of one to another is to safeguard
and protect the dignity of our common humanity - to be the true keeper of our
brothers  and  sisters,  especially  the  elderly,  youth,  differently  abled,  the
incapacitated and other vulnerable people in our society.

We  shall  seek  to  strengthen  ties  between  Barbadians  of  all  ages  in  order  to
enshrine the dignity of and respect for one another.  Understanding who children
are and the critical role they have in our present and future, we shall prioritise,
protect, guide, nurture, heal and love all our children, confident that raising them
with such care would provide them with an example of how to raise their own
children,  and  in  effect  create  the  foundation  for  emotionally  stable  and
responsible  citizens  and  residents.    We  uphold  family  as  a  key  institution
through which our present and future generations are and shall be nurtured.

EQUITABLE DEVELOPMENT

Our  progress  shall  be  defined  by  our  duty  of  care  to  one  another  which
recognises economic enfranchisement, access to food and nutritional security,
affordable  and  efficient  public  transport,  water,  sanitation,  universal  quality
education,  quality  healthcare,  affordable  housing  and  the  provision  of  social
protections aimed at eradicating poverty and providing for the most vulnerable
people within our society.  This is integral to ensuring an acceptable standard of
living, an enhanced quality of life and affording full participation to all citizens
in the overall development of our country.  We are each other’s keeper.

We pledge to ensure that our successive elected governments remain mindful
that  the  Barbadian  definition  of  growth  and  progress  must  always  be  people
centred.  We therefore commit to eliminating poverty through policies of social
inclusion,  equality  of  economic  opportunity,  ensuring  access  to  essential
services and the provision of social protection for the  most vulnerable in our
society.

We commit as individual Barbadians, to the giving of time, energy and resources
to our communities and national organisations so that they may increase their
influence as positive change agents in the society.

We pledge to make the best use of opportunities for our further education, both
formal  and  informal.    We  shall  encourage  industry,  a  spirit  of  innovation,
entrepreneurial  endeavour,  sporting  excellence,  artistic  creativity,  media
literacy,  critical thinking,  responsible  use  of  technology,  pluri-lingualism  and

7

the development of a culture of lifelong learning within our society.  We commit
to taking pride in all that we do.

We  commit  to  building  a  progressive  and  cohesive  society  through  the
empowerment and full engagement of our youth and communities in the pursuit
of personal excellence and the social and economic development of Barbados.

We  acknowledge  the  critical  role  that  Barbadians  by  birth,  by  descent,  by
marriage  and  by  choice  have  played  in  our  national  development  and  we
recognise the invaluable contribution of the Barbadian Diaspora.  We reflect,
with pride, on the past and present accomplishments of all Barbadians, wherever
they may be, who remain rooted in our Bajan values and traditions, and who
give life to the character of who we are as a people.  We commit to facilitating
the continued development and accomplishments of our people.

SOCIAL PARTNERSHIP

We  acknowledge  the  invaluable  contribution  of  the  Social  Partnership  of
workers, employers and government, and of the Social Justice Committee to the
stability and good governance of Barbados.   We shall strengthen and expand
this form of social consensus as an instrument of policy to protect the interests
of workers, investors and consumers while improving the competitiveness of the
economy as part of our national development.

We urge that relations within the workplace be based on fairness, mutual respect
and dignity so as to enhance the goals of the organisation and the wellbeing of
its constituents.  Workers and the trades unions are indispensable partners in our
economic prosperity.  Equally so are those who take the risks to invest in the
production of goods and services.

We pledge in our employment relationships to strive at all times to create an
environment  of  decent  work,  to  follow  established  industrial  relations  best
practices, to maintain service excellence, to ensure quality of production and in
general to work together with pride to increase the productivity and efficiency
of the enterprises with which we are associated.

We commit to working towards a more efficient and more transparent public
sector  that  places  our  citizens,  residents  and  visitors  at  the  centre  of  service
delivery, which meets their expectations and facilitates the equitable growth and
development of our country.

8

Article III

Every Barbadian has the right and a duty to participate in the economic,
political and social life of Barbados as an expression of active citizenship.
Every Barbadian has the right to vote and seek public office in accordance
with the Laws of this country.

DEMOCRACY

We acknowledge the establishment of a Barbados Parliament in 1639 and the
Charter of Barbados made at Oistins in 1652.

the  masses  and

We affirm the fact that a Parliament has met without interruption since 1639.
With its changing composition over the years, it has been a tool of oppression

against
enfranchisement.  Parliament enacted legislation to end slavery, to give us the
right to vote, to protect the rights of workers, to undertake an aggressive reform
of ownership of our tenantries, and to establish our political independence and
republican status.

later  an

We  celebrate  the  unique  part  played  in  our  history  by  each  of  our  National
Heroes for the betterment of some aspect of the lives of Barbadians and for their
contribution  to  our  national  development,  through  the  expression  of  courage,
sacrifice and the attainment of excellence.

We cherish the legacy of all those numerous Barbadians, heroes in their own
right,  whose  actions  distinguish  them  as  true  patriots  and  whose  lives  of
achievement and service enrich our history and continue as examples for us to
follow.

We champion in our nation and across the world democratic freedoms, human
rights, the rule of law, and the peaceful resolution of all conflicts.

We affirm, principally by our own self-discipline and respect for the rule of law,
support for our law enforcement agencies as they endeavour to rid our society
of  all  crime,  whether  of  violence,  human  trafficking,  illegal  drugs,  financial
crimes including bribery and other forms of corruption, lawlessness and abuse.
We acknowledge our duty as individual Barbadians, to work with and support
our law enforcement agencies.

9

We shall promote the right of access to information and the right to freedom of
communication  and  expression,  provided  always  that  there  is  protection  of  a
citizen’s personal data and that social or other media shall be respectful of the
rights and reputation of citizens.

We  agree  to  adhere  to  the  basic  tenets  on  which  the  rights  and  liberties  of  a
representative  democracy  are  founded  in  order  to  ensure  that  there  is  a  full
understanding of the role and function of civil society and the values that bind
us as a people.  We commit to active citizenship by participating in aspects of
national development.

Article IV

Everyone has the right to live in a healthy and balanced environment and
has a duty to participate in its preservation, conservation, enhancement and
regeneration.  We appreciate the defining importance of our land and sea
to our identity and way of life, and therefore also pledge to protect the free
and unrestricted access to all our beaches and public spaces, which is an
inalienable right of every Barbadian.

ENVIRONMENT, SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AND RESILIENCE

We  acknowledge  the  climate  crisis  and  our  duty  to  be  world  leaders  in  the
promotion of and agitation for global recognition of this clear and present danger
to our lives and livelihood. We pledge to adopt innovative policies and programs
to adapt and mitigate against our inherently vulnerable circumstances to build
resilience and ensure our survival as a people and country.

Our  public  policies  shall  promote  sustainable  development  through  the
protection and enhancement of the environment in all aspects of our economic
and social progress.

We commit to be responsible stewards, to respect and protect our unique and
vulnerable  natural  and  built  environment,  ensuring  that  the  actions  taken  to
secure the needs of our present generations also safeguard the rights of future
generations of Barbadians to meet their own needs.

10

As  a  Small  Island  State,  we  recognise  the  vulnerability  of  our  economy  and
society to external factors.  We therefore commit to expanding our support of
locally produced goods and services for our local consumption and exportation.
We realise that by establishing ourselves as both creators and consumers of high
quality products and services, we will secure that level of national development
which will benefit the entire society.

We acknowledge the historical trauma associated with our relationship to the
land and sea.  Hence, it is our responsibility to repair this relationship for current
and future generations of Barbadians,  and to ensure that it is defined through
ownership, enfranchisement and access.  We fully appreciate the importance of
our  land  and  sea  to  our  livelihoods  and  quality  of  life,  and  we  shall  forever
embrace the quintessential heritage of our island home.

We  commit  to  the  protection  of  our  land,  air  and  marine  environment,  in
particular our gullies and coral reefs, through progressive public policies which
support education, research and innovation, leading to their regeneration for the
benefit of all.

We  commit  to  expressing  our  Barbadian  culture  and  heritage  and  our  values
with  unbridled  confidence,  and  we  acknowledge  that  our  authenticity  as  a
caring,  just,  respectful  and  inclusive  people  is  at  the  heart  of  our  social,
environmental and economic development.

Article V

Barbados is part of a global community and strong international relations with
other states is vital to national development. As a Small Island State we must
exist  harmoniously  with  others  and  work  collaboratively  to  preserve  global
public goods. We will honour our international obligations while championing
the causes that are important to safeguarding the future prosperity and stability
of Barbados and the Caribbean.

11

ENGAGING THE WORLD

Historically Barbados has made significant contributions to global dialogue on
matters pertaining to Small Island Developing States, rooting its foreign policy
on the principles of dynamic, moral strategic leadership.  We further commit to
strengthening  our  international  relations  recognising  that  the  challenges  and
solutions  of  sustainable  development  are  the  collective  responsibility  of  our
global village, and must be addressed through dynamic and ethical leadership,
global action and collaboration among states.

MULTILATERALISM

Barbados reaffirms its commitment to the principles and values enshrined in the
Charter of the United Nations.  We commit to multilateralism as a platform for
advocacy  to  achieve  the  global  public  goods,  and  as  a  platform  to  build
consensus on the major challenges confronting the global community.

SOUTH–SOUTH COOPERATION

We  commit  to  deeper  cooperation  among  countries  of  the  Global  South
recognising  that  we  must  move  beyond  our  traditional  North  Atlantic
diplomacy.    We  commit  to  creating  mutually  beneficial  relationships  with
countries  in  the  developing  world  to  facilitate  technical  cooperation,  market
diversification  through  commercial  diplomacy,  and  cultural  and  social
exchanges.

REGIONALISM

We  reaffirm  our  support  for  regional  integration  through  the  Caribbean
Community (CARICOM) recognising the critical importance of this institution
to the advancement of our Caribbean civilisation.

CONCLUSION

We, the people of this great nation Barbados, encouraged by the resilience and
ingenuity of those who came before us, stand on the threshold of a bright future
and  we  boldly  embrace  and  solemnly  affirm  the  aspirations  contained  in this
Charter of Barbados.

12

May the hope it engenders permeate the length and breadth of this nation and
distinguish it as a land of equal opportunity and enfranchisement, fairness and
social justice, peace and security, and solidarity and cooperation.

May the commitment we now champion, progressively foster and nurture the
‘Soul of our Nation’ from generation to generation.

APPENDIX II – PUBLIC SUBMISSIONS

xxiv  The  Supremacy  of  God:  The  first  is  the  complete  removal  of  the  most  important
sentence  in  our  preamble  to  the  Constitution.    Namely,  that  we  acknowledge  the
supremacy of God.  Why have you taken that important sentence out of a document
that may replace the preamble?

xxv.  Promotion of False gods: Barbados is not a theocracy.  People can believe what they
wish and be free to convince others of their beliefs without penalty or discrimination.
But the standard of the majority should be set.  If we become a majority of Muslims
or Hindus, then they will set their standard and the minority Christians will likely be
persecuted  as  is  happening  in  almost  every  country  where  Christians  are  in  the
minority.  Why are you facilitating foreseen persecution?

xxvi.  Equal  Rights:  You  plan  to  assign  equal  rights  based  on  age,  gender  and  sexual
orientation.  Clearly a 5-year-old is not allowed to drive in Barbados.  Therefore, they
are not treated equally.  So, it needs to be rethought.

xxvii.  This is a classic example of what happens when you try to recreate the wheel.  The
better approach would be to present the current preamble to the Constitution, and then
let people suggest improvements for discussion, rather than trying to create something
entirely new – as if the old had no value whatsoever and is irredeemable.  That is a
dangerously reckless approach to such an important matter.

xxviii.  On the gender and sexual orientation issues, we see what happened in the US, where
those provisions were mainly used to  persecute  Christians.   We also  see the Trans
gender issue is forcing females to compete with males in female sports.  Why would
you want to bring that confusion to Barbados at this time?

xxix.  Promoting  Division:  There  is  repetitive  theme  of  social  and  reparatory  justice  and
healing the wounds of slavery.  Part of it reads like the communist/socialist manifesto,
which have failed everywhere they have been tried.  So, why are we trying them here?
The only way to heal hurt is to forgive.

xxx.  To what extent does economic vulnerability and dependence on foreign aid limit our

ability to think and act independently and to forge a unique Barbadian identity?

xxxi.  To what extent does the need for such things as food security, foreign investment and

a vibrant tourism industry curb our cultural autonomy?

xxxii.  How do we maintain a pragmatic balance between the often-conflicting realities of
economic  dependence,  global  interdependence  and  our  own  independence  as  a
developing nation?

xxxiii.  Understanding where we were, where we are and where we want to go, will empower

us to work towards a common goal as citizens despite our differences.

xxxiv.  Comments on Preamble:
xxxv.  Paragraph  7  of  the  Preamble  rightly  affirms  that  we  are  all  created  equal.    The
reference to ‘The Creator’, suggests a generic theism that is non-aligned.  As a Bible-
believing  Christian  I  would  prefer  the  term  ‘God’  to  characterize  the  country  as  a
decidedly Christian nation.   However, since  citizens  adhere to  different  faiths, this
non-alignment is understandable within a secular context.

15

xxxvi.  Paragraphs  8,  9  and  10  could  be  re-ordered  (10,  8,  9)  so  that  the  final  focus  is  on

Barbados and segues into Paragraph 11 and the Articles that follow.

xxxvii. Comments on Article 1
xxxviii The preamble to the draft Charter reaffirms our commitment to fundamental rights
and  freedoms.    In  1948,  when  the  Universal  Declaration  of  Human  Rights  was
codified,  there  was  a  tacit  agreement  about  the  rights  and  freedoms  that  were
foundational to harmonious living among persons and nations of diverse backgrounds
and persuasions.  Today however, there is controversy largely between the developed
and developing countries as to what rights and freedoms are, in fact, ‘fundamental’.
xxxix  I  fully  agree  that  all  Barbadians  are  born  free  and  equal  despite  any  differences
contingent  upon  birth,  beliefs,  fortuitous  circumstances,  background  or  lifestyle.
However,  I  suggest  that  the  term  ‘sexual  orientation’  not  be  included  among  the
specific  categories  listed.    Reasons  are  as  follows:  a.  The  term  is  rooted  in  the
scientifically inaccurate beliefs that: i. sex is non-binary, and gender is fluid; that is,
that there is not only male and female but an indeterminate number of sexes and there
is logically no one-to-one correspondence between sex and gender, ii. it is possible
for an individual to change their sex and iii. biological and physical characteristics
resulting  from  chromosomal  pairs  XY  and  XX  do  not  indicate  sex;  this  is  merely
‘assigned’ at birth on the basis of genitalia.  As a maturing country, it would be folly
for us to embrace this counter evidence-based assumption.  My suggestion is that, in
considering the term ‘sexual orientation’, we adopt the COVID19 approach: follow
the science and act out of an abundance of caution.  b. The term ‘sexual orientation’
is specific to sexual rights philosophy.  Unlike other terms such as sex, gender, age,
class,  faith,  ability,  cultural  and  educational  background,  it  is  not  value  neutral.
Inclusion of the term in the proposed Charter suggests that as a nation we embrace
sexual rights as a guiding philosophy even though we have not yet had any rigorous
national dialogue on the matter.  Since 2001 and over the last decade, we have had
examples of the litigation, suppression and violation of traditional human rights that
accompanies acceptance of the notion of ‘sexual orientation’.  We have seen the logic-
defying implications for education, labour, health and sports.  For example, in 2019
the World’s Women’s Cycling Championship was won by a biological male.  If the
term  ‘sexual  orientation’  is  to  be  included  in  the  Charter,  this  should  be  with  full
understanding  of  its  sometimes-bizarre  ramifications.    The  adage,  look  before  you
leap, is apt in this case.  In Caribbean parlance, I would say, let us not push our heads
where our bodies can’t pass.  c. The term should not be included in the Charter because
it  sets  a  precedent:  i.  Why  should  sexual  orientation  be  highlighted  as  a  separate
category and not ‘age orientation’, ‘race orientation’ or ‘class’ orientation?  Are there
boundaries  to  sexual  orientation,  if  so,  what  are  they  and  what  is  the  rationale  for
setting such boundaries? ii. The term is loosely defined and ever-evolving.  The World
Health  Organization  identifies  3  elements  of  sexual  orientation:  sexual  attraction,
sexual behaviour and sexual identity.  In some countries, acceptance of the term has
paved the way for legal incest.  According to a 2018 article written by James Cox and
published in the Scottish Sun, “Consensual incest is fully legal in Spain, Russia, and
is

Portuguese

prohibited

strictly

under

not

law.

16

xl.

xli.

There  is  also  no  law  prohibiting  consenting  relatives  from  having  sex  in  France,
Belgium and Luxembourg.  In Italy, incest is illegal only if it provokes public scandal
- when it can suddenly become punishable from two to eight years in jail.”  The fluid
concept  of  sexual  orientation  can  logically  be  extended  to  include  pedophilia.    In
Australia,  Italy,  the  USA,  UK,  Canada,  Switzerland,  Norway  and  a  few  other
countries, currently there are groups advocating for the recognition of pedophilia as a
sexual orientation and therefore a fundamental right and freedom.
The inclusion of the term ‘sexual orientation’ in the Charter is prejudicial to that sector
of society that subscribes to the sanctity of marriage and to those of us who see the
concept  as  fodder for the deconstruction of marriage and the family, and the risky
reconstruction  of  both.    Perhaps  it  can  be  replaced  by  a  neutral,  all-encompassing
phrase  such  as  ‘or  any  other  distinguishing  feature.’    This  should  be  sufficient  to
satisfy those who believe that there is such a thing as sexual orientation and those who
do not.  Moreover, it is consistent with the way in which the Charter has tried to be
inclusive  by  using  the  generic,  non-aligned,  non-committal  term,  ‘Creator’  in
Paragraph 7 of the Preamble.
Comments on Article 11 Paragraph 3 under the topic ‘Respect’ makes mention of the
family as “the key institution … that shall nurture future generations.”  There is no
definition of family and no mention of marriage.  In the current sociopolitical sexual
rights climate where there is no consensus among nations as to the definition of these
formerly  straightforward  terms,  it  is  important  in  any  formal  document,  to  clearly
articulate Barbadian values regarding these two core institutions of society.  I would
like to see Barbados, like Hungary, declare itself a family-friendly country and with
“unbridled  confidence”  define  marriage  as  a  union  between  a  biological  male  and
biological female.

xlii.  Comment on Articles 3 and 4: As pointed out by previous submissions, these are well
conceptualized and with the suggested inclusions and modifications, provide a firm
basis for framing laws within the post-Republic Constitution.
In  the  spirit  of  this  proposed  Charter,  I  fully  anticipate  that  all  participants  in  this
discussion will have not only an equal voice but also an equal ear.

xliii.

xliv.  All Barbadians are conceived and born free and are equal in human dignity and rights.
Reason: The unborn in the womb is in need of recognition and protection; There is no
need for categories listing.  ‘All Barbadians’ is an inclusive statement; The document
should close with Thanksgiving to God; Barbadians need to be reminded that we have
not gotten where we are without divine help and need to be conscious that preservation
of  gains  are  in  God’s  hands;  Those  acknowledgements  should  be  acceptable  to
everyone irrespective of their conceptualization of God.

xlv.  The atheists may object but even he is his own God and based on the document is free

xlvi.

to thank himself.
I  start  from  the  perspective  that  all  people  are  equal  and  deserve  their  rights  and
dignity  by  virtue  of  being  human,  and  for  no  other  reason  than  that.    With  that
perspective,  nothing  in  our  national  aspirational  or  inspirational  documents  or

17

symbols should use language or ideas that exclude or marginalize any person or group
of persons.  I am an atheist.  My atheism is not an assertion that there is no god because
logically, it’s impossible to prove a philosophical negative.

Rather, it’s the rejection of the strident but unprovable assertion by most people that
a god or gods exist.  It is rather painful to be treated as a second- or third-class citizen
in my own country because of my philosophical position.  Unfortunately, our National
Anthem  refers  to  the  Lord being the people’s  guide.    But,  as an  atheist,  how am  I
supposed to feel, other than excluded, by such sentiments being thus enshrined.

xlvii.  It  would  be  very  useful  if  the  paragraphs  were  numbered  appropriately  so  that  the

sections and paragraphs could be easily referenced.

xlviii.  Preamble Paragraph 7 asserts as a fact that “. . . we are all equal in the eyes of the
Creator”,  but  from  whence  do  we  derive  the  assertion  that  there  is  a  “creator”,  or
further that he sees us all as equal.  The history of religion and the scriptures of most
religions prescribe very different treatment for different classes of people based on
gender,  race,  social  status,  religious  faith,  etc.    Why  is  the  assertion  necessary,
anyway?

l.

xlix.  Likewise, the same paragraph seems to suggest that we are equal because of the laws
of the land.  However, our equality derives from our humanity.  In the past, our laws
allowed slavery, the unequal treatment of women, etc. So, our laws must be crafted to
ensure that our human equality is assured.  The laws must be derived from this fact,
not the other way around.
Article  1  –  The  preamble  to  this  section  is  a  bit  troubling.    It  mentions  age,  race,
ethnicity,  faith,  class  cultural  and  educational  background,  ability,  sex,  gender,  or
sexual orientation as the basis for our rights and dignity.
I have perused the document with meticulous care and every scruple of integrity but
on reading Article 1, I am left in in complete ignorance as to what is sexual orientation
since you have itemized sex and gender.

li.

lii.  WHY MUST SUCH AN EXPRESSION BE DRAGGED ALONG SUCCINTLY AT

liii.

THE END OF THAT SENTENCE.
That should be removed with immediate haste for it seems to lessen the quality of our
people as we move into the status of becoming a republic.

lv.

liv.  Was such an expression in our original constitution if it was not there before how can
it be attached now.  Should not our people have a say in such a pertinent matter.
The proposed Charter of Barbados is a thoughtful encapsulation of the ideal Barbados
which  citizens  should  work  towards,  both  separately  and  together.    Family-Faith-
Freedom,  Barbados,  commends  the  Advisory  Committee  for  developing  this
conceptual framework which can effectively unite us despite our many differences,
and can steer us on to, and keep us on a firm path of progress.

lvi.  We suggest that the Preamble include the following paragraph: “COGNIZANT of the
reality that  future  generations of Barbadians  will be shaped by the children of this
generation  and  the  next,  we  will  strive  to  ensure  that  our  children  are  raised  to  be
respectful,  civicminded  and  to  uphold  wholesome  values  that  are  grounded  in
godliness and truth.”

18

lvii.  Article  1  speaks  of  intrinsic  human  dignity  and  rights.  We  recommend  that  it  also
underscore the sanctity of human life from conception, through birth, life and natural
death.

lviii.  The use of the word ‘Creator’ – as opposed to ‘God’ in Paragraph 7 of the Preamble,
signals a departure from a Judeo-Christian anchor and an orientation towards secular
humanism.    We  consider  this  unfortunate  and  recommend  that  this  decision  be
revisited.  We respectfully ask that the reference to ‘the Creator’ be rephrased as a
reference to ‘God’ or ‘The Lord’.

lix.  We  acknowledge  the  detailed  explanations  given  by  a  member  of  the  Committee
regarding the validity of, and the need to protect the values of sex, gender and what
has  been  termed  ‘sexual  orientation’  within  the  context  of  human  rights.    We
respectfully submit however, that sex and gender are clearly defined values; sex being
the  biological  differentiation  between  male  and  female,  and  gender  being  a
sociological  construct  largely  derived  from  common  sense  responses  to  these
differences.    We  categorically  reject  the  notion  that  sexual  orientation  is  a  human
right.    No  other  human  right  is  out  of  sync  with  nature.    The  World  Health
Organization  identifies  3  elements  of  sexual  orientation,  one  of  these  being  sexual
attraction.  What if an individual’s ‘sexual orientation’ is towards adult to child sex,
human  to  animal  sex,  child-parent  sex  or  involves  any  other  attraction  such  as
necrophilia?  Are there boundaries to sexual orientation?  If so, what circumscribes
these  boundaries?    If  an  individual’s  ‘orientation’,  that  is,  their  natural  attraction,
preferred behaviour and self-identity is to be deemed a fundamental human right, why
should  this  be  limited  to  sexual  orientation  and  not  be  extended  to  include  class,
educational background, ethnicity or any of the other categories listed in Article 1?
Given the tenuous definition of the term, we unequivocally request the non-inclusion
of sexual orientation as an intrinsic value in the Charter and Constitution of Barbados
and in the related laws and statutes.
FAMILY:  We  agree  with  the  main  tenets  of  Article  2.    This  Article  addresses  the
importance of human capital and, among other things, speaks to the desirability of
forging  mutual  bonds  of  respect  and  dignity  among  citizens  of  all  ages  and
persuasions.    We  especially  applaud  the  recognition  of  the  family  as  “the  key
institution  through  which  our  present  and  future  generations  are  and  shall  be
nurtured.”  Article 16.3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that “The
family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection
by society and the State.”

lx.

lxi.  We propose that Barbados declare itself a Family-Friendly Country (similar to what
Hungary has done).  As a small island developing state with limited natural resources,
it is critical that the country provide an enabling environment for the development of
human capital including Government support via the following: a. A family-friendly
labour code that considers childcare, job protection for nursing mothers, child welfare
measures and in general, practical, innovative measures for the reconciliation of work
and  family.    A  sound  educational  system  that  provides  accurate  information  about
human  sexuality  and  sexual  health  as  part  of  the  existing  Health  and  Family  Life
Education regional curriculum; b. A deliberate inculcation of civic morality among
youth via a national youth service, mandatory to those school leavers who are neither

19

employed  nor  enrolled  in  further  vocational  or  academic  education  after  a  year  of
leaving school.

lxii.

FAITH:  Paragraph  7  of  the  Preamble  subscribes  to  the  notion  of  a  ‘Creator’.    An
intelligent  Creator  creates  with  design  and  purpose.    However,  there  is  an  internal
contradiction in Article 1 which overlooks both design and purpose in creation, by
inclusion  of  the  term  ‘sexual  orientation’.    This  inclusion  is  far  reaching  and
undermines  marriage  and  family,  the  two  key  institutions  of  society.    The  social
benefits  of  marriage  and  a  stable  family  life  are  values  upheld  by  Christianity  and
other Faiths within our country.

lxiii.  FREEDOM The Preamble to the Charter reaffirms solidarity in the vision of “a truly
free, independent, fair and just Barbados for all”.  The vision is noble and necessary.
Yet,  although the document  speaks liberally about  related concepts  such as human
dignity, equality, and justice, there is a certain incongruity in the way it promotes the
authenticity of one’s mirror image.  What is upheld as desirable in forging a unique
national identity is denied as important when it comes to accepting self.  True freedom
must be morally and sensibly circumscribed and built on a foundation of truth.  There
is little difference whether that truth be the legacy of slavery at a national level, or, at
an individual level, the biological facts of sex and inherent characteristics.

lxiv.  We  should  aspire  to  a  nation  where  respect,  compassion,  care,  fairness  and
cooperation are evident in all that we do.  A nation where our prisons are empty and
every person is fed and sheltered; where the sick and elderly are cared for and every
person who is capable of working is working assiduously to preserve the quality of
life we have determined for ourselves.

lxv.  To actualize such an aspiration our children must become our priority.
lxvi.  Children are, not only our offspring, they are the torch bearers of tomorrow that we

bring to this earth.  How we treat them is an indication of our regard for our future.

lxvii.  They each arrive here with a purpose and though, in large measure, we have lost those
practices that allow us to learn who they are and how they should be guided and taught
to fulfil their purpose, we are obliged to protect, nurture, guide and truly love them.
That is indeed part of our individual obligation as parents and our collective obligation
as the village, the community and the society.

lxviii.  In their young years they are tender and therefore must be cared for with a reverend
spirit.  They have only just arrived from the spirit world; there is no disputing that
idea; it is a fundamental understanding that runs through all spiritual belief systems.
That is who children are.

lxix.  Many children come bearing their torches, we see them – if we refer to them as bright,
old for their  years, wise, even “rude”  – we see them.  There are here to  illuminate
aspects of our lives that we need to examine, correct and enhance.  They are here to
teach us and assist us in our growth so that we too fulfil our purpose.  We in turn, for
what  we  should  have  learnt  (by  the  time  they  arrive)  must  apply  wisdom  in  our
dealings with them.  We are to set the example for them to follow and build upon
because they will be the ones stepping into the future.  Their role is critical – we must
respect them and be mindful of how we interact with them.

20

lxx.  Being an example of good and noble character ensures us a responsible and stable
future.   Our  children  – if the right  foundation is  laid, will raise their children with
respect and the nobility of character we demonstrated in raising them.

“Specifically religious language is problematic”

lxxi.
lxxii.  “instead of faith, say belief”
lxxiii.  “religion or lack thereof”
lxxiv.   “use creed”
lxxv.  “remove  creator”:    “Use  of  the  ‘Creator  ‘immediately  alienates  those  who  do  not
believe that humans were not created by any one entity.”  “What about polytheistic
religions?”  ‘If the use of ‘Creator’ makes a segment of the population feel excluded,
why include it?  There are other ways to convey the concept of equality.

lxxvi.  There was a general wariness of the family being mentioned without making it explicit
that family does not just mean a nuclear heterosexual family.  There needs to be a
recognition  of  different  family  types  like  multigenerational  households,  chosen
families, non-heteronormative families etc.

lxxvii.  All references to ‘brothers and sisters’ throughout the document should be replaced

with gender-neutral language.

lxxviii. The  reference  to  ‘fathers’  in  the  preamble  is  unnecessarily  gendered  as  those
categorised as women contributed, albeit more behind the scenes and uncredited work.
If ‘fathers’ is meant to refer to Errol Barrow and Grantley Adams specifically, this
could be made explicit.

lxxix.  Not just racial or socio-economic oppression.  Oppression based on sexual orientation
through laws.  No explicit recognition of the marginalization as a result of intersecting
factors  e.g.  poor,  undereducated,  transgender  women  with  disabilities  has  very
specific vulnerabilities which are inextricably linked.

lxxx.  There  were  strong  feelings  on  this  point.    It  is  factually  incorrect  to  state  in  the
preamble that we are equal according to the laws of the land.  There are laws which
do not reflect the fact that we are equal.  Furthermore, equality does not stem from the
laws.  It’s the other way around, the laws should reflect equality.

lxxxi.  All  individuals  and  organizations  consulted  felt  very  strongly  about  the  use  of
‘tolerance’.    It  was  agreed  that  the  term  ‘inclusion’  should  replace  tolerance  and
accompany respect  each time it is mentioned because in  order to  earn respect,  one
must be included.  While it was understood that the primary definition of ‘tolerate’
has neutral to positive connotations, the secondary definition does not.

lxxxii.  “Barbados’  discrimination  against  our  Caribbean  and  Latin  American  neighbours
especially  when  it  comes  to  immigration  and  residency  must  end.    We  are  all  too
willing to allow citizens from wealthy countries to flout our laws while we replicate
their worst behaviour when it comes to discrimination against those from countries
we deem “lesser”.”  “Diversity is a valuable resource”.  “We should uphold equality
with immigration laws and protect the rights of citizens and those married to citizens
as well as the wider global community.”  “I recommend that the leaders of Barbados

21

proceed with caution on this issue regardless of sexual orientation, because our system
is already challenged with how to equitably take care of their own citizens, first”.

lxxxiii. It  was  felt  that  we  as  a  marginalised  community  must  highlight  the  fact  that
xenophobia is much too common in Barbados.  We must also acknowledge that too
many  of  us  seek  refuge  elsewhere  because  they  feel  unable  to  live  full  lives  in
Barbados.  Therefore, there is consensus that the Charter should explicitly state that
we  will  uphold  the  fundamental  equality  and  human  dignity  of  all  within  our
jurisdiction (so inhabitants, Barbadians and residents).

lxxxiv. It  was  felt  that  the  section  that  mentions  the  Social  Partnership  and  Social  Justice
Committee should make it clear that it is about protecting the interest of Barbadians
and those who live here, not just consumers.

lxxxv.  “Right to assessments and fair academic accommodations for children with learning
disabilities” “Children didn't choose to be here; they should be protected at all costs”.
lxxxvi.  “As a nation we have unfortunately normalized  the harsh punishment for children
more than we normalize and stride to protect them from discrimination especially on
the grounds of their indecisive sexual orientation status.”  “I recommend that human
children be recognized as human children based on their age category by law.
lxxxvii  “Disabled  children  should  have  access  to  free  primary,  secondary  and  tertiary

education like other children.”

lxxxviii  “Juvenile  laws  should  be  diverse  and  specific  and  wholly  intent  on  protecting

children and not criminalising them.”

lxxxix  “I don't believe children should be raised by same sex couples at all.”
xc.

There was concern that children were not explicitly mentioned.   If we are to move
away  from  “children  must  be  seen  and  not  heard”,  they  must  be  included  in  the
Charter.  Children must have a voice regarding their wellbeing and their right to also
participate in civic life must be acknowledged.  There was also a concern that if the
rights of the child are to be mentioned, it should be made clear that LGBTQ+ children
have the same rights as other children.  There is also the issue of the assumption that
LGBTQ+  children  have  been  pressured  or  influenced.    However,  from  our  own
experience  as  LGBTQ+  children  and  from  our  interactions  with  LGBTQ+  youth,
children  have  agency  and  are  well  aware  of  who  they  are.    This  should  be
acknowledged and respected.
It was agreed that there was not enough emphasis put on the fact that the environment
should be protected whether or not there are direct and easily quantifiable benefits to
us as human beings.  We have a duty to do as little harm as possible and to preserve
biodiversity.  The section on the environment needs to be fleshed out more and the
focus should be expanded beyond anthropocentricity.
