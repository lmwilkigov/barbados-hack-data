disregarded  in  assessing  the  existence  and  extent  of  any
secondary liability under paragraph (b) of subsection (1);

the liabilities of the company’s non-cellular assets shall abate
rateably until the value of the aggregate liabilities equals the
value  of  those  assets,  but  the  provisions  of  this  paragraph
shall not apply in any situation in which any of the liabilities
of the company’s non-cellular assets arise from fraud or by
reason of a special agreement referred to in subsection (1).

The rights of creditors of a segregated cell company shall

No creditor shall have any rights other than the rights referred to

(2)
in this section and in sections 356.45 and 356.48.

There shall be implied, except in so far as the same is expressly
(3)
excluded in writing, in every transaction entered into by a segregated
cell company the following terms:

(a)

(b)

(c)

that no party shall seek, whether in any proceedings or by any
other means whatsoever or wherever, to make or attempt to
make liable any cellular assets attributable to any cell of the
company in respect of a liability not attributable to that cell;

that if any party shall succeed by any means whatsoever or
wherever in making liable any cellular assets attributable to
any  cell  of  the  company  in  respect  of  a  liability  not
attributable  to  that  cell,  that  party  shall  be  liable  to  the
company to pay a sum equal to the value of the benefit thereby
obtained by him; and

that if any party shall succeed in seizing or attaching by any
means  or  otherwise  levying  execution  against  any  cellular
assets attributable to any cell of the company in respect of a
liability not attributable to that cell, that party shall hold those
assets or their proceeds on trust for the company and shall
keep  those  assets  or  proceeds  separate  and  identifiable  as
such trust property.

All sums recovered by a segregated cell company as a result of
(4)
any such trust as is described in paragraph (c) of subsection (3) shall be
credited  against  any  concurrent  liability  imposed  pursuant  to  the
implied term as set out in paragraph (b) of subsection (3).

25

(5)
Any  asset  or  sum  recovered  by  a  segregated  cell  company
pursuant  to  the  implied  term  set  out  in  paragraphs  (b)  or  (c)  of
subsection (3) or by any other means whatsoever or wherever in the
circumstances referred to in those paragraphs, shall, after the deduction
or payment of any costs of recovery, be applied by the company so as
to compensate the cell affected.

Where any cellular assets attributable to a cell of a segregated
(6)
cell company are taken in respect of a liability not attributable to that
cell,  and  in  so  far  as  such  assets  or  compensation  in  respect  thereof
cannot otherwise be restored to the cell affected, the company shall

(a)

(b)

cause or procure its auditor to certify the value of the assets
lost to the cell affected; and

transfer  or  pay,  from  the  cellular  or  non-cellular  assets  to
which the liability was attributable to the cell affected, assets
or sums sufficient to restore to the cell affected the value of
the assets lost.

Where under paragraph (b) of subsection (6) a segregated cell
(7)
company is obliged to make a transfer or payment from cellular assets
attributable to a cell of the company and those assets are insufficient,
the company shall so far as possible, make up the deficiency from its
non-cellular assets.

Recourse to cellular assets by creditors

356.47.
attributable to a cell of a segregated cell company

Subject  to  sections  356.45  and    356.46,  cellular  assets

(a)

shall only be available to the creditors of the company who
are creditors in respect of that cell and who shall thereby be
entitled, in conformity with the provisions of this Act, to have
recourse to the cellular assets attributable to that cell; and

26

(b)

shall  be  absolutely  protected  from  the  creditors  of  the
company who are not creditors in respect of that cell and who
accordingly  shall  not  be  entitled  to  have  recourse  to  the
cellular assets attributable to that cell.

Transfer of cellular and non-cellular assets from a segregated
cell company

Cellular  assets  attributable  to  a  cell  of  a  segregated  cell
356.48.(1)
company may be transferred in the ordinary course of the company’s
business through payments, investments or otherwise to another cell of
the  segregated  cell  company  or  to  a  person,  wherever  resident  or
incorporated.

A  transfer  of  cellular  assets,  pursuant  to  subsection  (1),
(2)
attributable to a cell of a segregated cell company shall not of itself
entitle creditors of that company to have recourse to the assets of the
person to whom the cellular assets were transferred, except where such
transfer of cellular assets was made by fraud or with intent to defraud
creditors.

Non-cellular assets shall not be transferred by a segregated cell
(3)
company unless the transfer is permitted by a special resolution of the
segregated cell company.

The  provisions  of  this  section  shall  not  affect  any  power  of  a
(4)
segregated cell company to lawfully make payments or transfers from
the  cellular  assets  attributable  to  any  cell  of  the  segregated  cell
company to a person entitled, in conformity with the provisions of the
Act, to have recourse to those cellular assets.

Attribution of non-cellular assets and liabilities

attributable to any of its cells shall be discharged from the company’s
non-cellular assets.

27

(2)
Income, receipts and other property or rights of or acquired by a
segregated cell company not otherwise attributable to any cell shall be
applied to and comprised in the company’s non-cellular assets.

Protection of creditors

356.50.(1)

A segregated cell company shall

(a)

(b)

inform  any  persons  with  whom  it  transacts  that  it  is  a
segregated cell company; and

for the purposes of that transaction, identify or specify the
cell in respect of which that person is transacting unless that
transaction is not a transaction in respect of a particular cell.

Where,  in  contravention  of  subsection  (1),  a  segregated  cell

(2)
company

(a)

(b)

fails to inform a person that he is transacting with a segregated
cell company and that person is otherwise unaware that, and
has no reasonable grounds to believe that, he is transacting
with a segregated cell company; or

fails to identify or specify the cell in respect of which a person
is transacting and that person is otherwise unaware of and has
no reasonable basis of knowing which cell he is transacting
with,

then in either such case

(i)

the directors shall, notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary in the company’s articles or in any contract with
the company or otherwise, incur personal liability to that
person in respect of the transaction; and

(ii)

the directors shall have a right of indemnity against the
non-cellular  assets  of  the  company,  unless  they  were

28

fraudulent, they knowingly authorised, acquiesced in or
permitted the contravention or acted in bad faith.

Notwithstanding sub-paragraph (i) of subsection (2), the court
(3)
may relieve a director of all or part of his personal liability thereunder
if he satisfies the court that the director ought fairly to be so relieved
because

(a)

(b)

he  was  not  aware  of  the  circumstances  giving  rise  to  his
liability and, in being not so aware, he was neither fraudulent,
nor did he knowingly authorise or acquiesce in, nor permit
the contravention, nor did he act in bad faith; or

he  expressly  objected  and  exercised  rights  as  he  had  as  a
director, whether by way of voting powers or otherwise, so
as to try to prevent the circumstances giving rise to liability.

Where,  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  subsection  (3),  the  court
(4)
relieves  a  director  of  all  or  part  of  his  personal  liability  under  sub-
paragraph (i) of subsection (2), the court may order that the liability in
question shall instead be met from such of the cellular or non-cellular
assets  of  the  segregated  cell  company  as  may  be  specified  in  the
order.

Transfer of a cell

356.51.(1)
A cell of a segregated cell company may be transferred to
another segregated cell company or to an incorporated cell company.

(2)

In order to effect a transfer under subsection (1),

(a)

(b)

a  segregated  cell  company  and  another  segregated  cell
company; or

a  segregated  cell  company  and  an  incorporated  cell
company,

shall enter into a written agreement that sets out the terms of the transfer.

29

(3)

Notwithstanding subsection (2),

(a)

(b)

the directors of each company shall approve the agreement
in writing; and

each company involved in the transfer shall pass a special
resolution authorising the transfer set out in the agreement.

Where a director of the segregated cell company approves the

(4)
agreement, he shall within 21 days

(a)

sign a declaration which states that he reasonably believes
that  the  cell,  is,  where  applicable,  able  to  discharge  its
liabilities when they become due and the transfer has been
agreed to in accordance with subsection (3); and

(b)

deliver a copy of the declaration to the company to which the
cell is to be transferred.

A director who makes a false statement on a declaration is guilty

(5)
of an offence.

The company to which the cell is to be transferred shall submit

(6)
the following to the Registrar for approval of the transfer:

(a)

a copy of the special resolution of each company authorising
the transfer;

(b)

a copy of the transfer agreement;

(c)

subject to subsection (4), a copy of the declaration of each
director;

(d)

a copy of its by-laws.

The  segregated  cell  company  from  which  the  cell  is  to  be

(7)
transferred shall submit a copy of its by-laws to the Registrar.

30

(8)
The Registrar shall not approve a transfer where the transfer of
the cell is inconsistent with the by-laws of the company transferring the
cell or the company to which the cell is to be transferred.

(9)

Where the Registrar approves a transfer,

(a)

(b)

(c)

the  Registrar  shall  record  the  transfer  in  the  Register  of
Companies;

the cell ceases to be a cell of the segregated cell company
from which it was transferred;

the cell becomes a cell or an incorporated cell, as the case
may be, of the company to which it has been transferred.

(10)

Where a cell is transferred

(a)

to another segregated cell company,

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

the property and rights of the cell immediately before
the transfer shall become the property and rights of that
segregated cell company;

all  liabilities,  contracts,  debts  and  obligations  of  the
segregated  cell  company  in  respect  of  the  cell
immediately before the transfer shall, in respect of the
transferred cell, become the liabilities, contracts, debts
and obligations of that segregated cell company;

legal  proceedings  which
all  actions  and  other
immediately  before  the  transfer  could  have  been
instituted or continued by or against a segregated cell
company,  in  respect  of  the  cell,  may  be  instituted  or
continued by or against the segregated cell company to
which the cell is transferred;

(iv)

any conviction, ruling, order or judgment in favour or
against a segregated cell company  in respect of the cell
immediately before the transfer, may be enforced by or

31

against  the  segregated  cell  company  to  which  the
cell is transferred;

(b)

to an incorporated cell company as an incorporated cell,

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

the property and rights of a segregated cell company in
respect of the cell immediately before the transfer, shall
become the property and rights of the incorporated cell;

all  liabilities,  contracts,  debts  and  obligations  of  the
segregated  cell  company,  in  respect  of  the  cell,
immediately  before  the  transfer  shall  become  the
liabilities,  contracts,  debts  and  obligations  of  the
incorporated cell;

all  actions  and  other
legal  proceedings  which
immediately  before  the  transfer  could  have  been
instituted or continued by or against a segregated cell
company  in  respect  of  the  cell,  may  be  instituted  or
continued by or against the incorporated cell;

any conviction, ruling, order or judgment in favour or
against a segregated cell company in respect of the cell
before the transfer, may be enforced by or against the
incorporated cell.

Administration order in relation to segregated cell
companies or cells

356.53.(1)

Subject  to  the  other  provisions  of  this  section,  where  in

(a)

(b)

the  cellular  assets  attributed  to  a  particular  cell  of  the
company,  when  account  is  taken  of  the  company’s  non-
cellular assets, are or are likely to be insufficient to discharge
the claims of creditors in respect of that cell; or

the company’s cellular assets and non-cellular assets are or
are likely to be insufficient to discharge the liabilities of the
company,

33

and the court considers that the making of an order under this section

An administration order may be made in respect of one or more

The purposes for which an administration order may be made

(3)
are

(a)

(b)

the survival as a going concern of the cell or of the company;

the more advantageous realisation of the business and assets

An administration order, whether in respect of a segregated cell

(4)
company or a cell

may not be made where

(i)

(ii)

Any person dealing with the administrator in good faith need not
(4)
be concerned to enquire whether the administrator is acting within his
powers.

When an application has been made for an administration order

Upon discharging an administration order, the court may direct,

(a)

(b)

where  the  administration  order  was  made  in  respect  of
