Insertion of section 5A into Act 2013-21

following:

The  principal  Act  is  amended  by  inserting  after  section  5,  the

“Representations or objections regarding application for
licence

5A.(1)
An interested party who desires to make a representation or
an objection in relation to an application for a licence by an applicant
to  whom  section  5(3)  applies  shall,  within  28  days  of  the  first
publication of notice of the application, inform the Minister in writing
of his representation or objection.

(2)

The interested party

(a)

shall

(i)

(ii)

state his interest in the application;

as  far  as  practicable,  state  concisely,  in  numbered
paragraphs,  the  precise  nature  and  ground  of  his
representation or objection; and

(iii)

include any supporting evidence; and

5

(b)

shall not make a representation or an objection in respect of
anything  that  is  not  directly  related  to  a  matter  set  out  in
section 6(2)(b) or (3)(a) to (d).

(3)
Where  the  Minister,  after  consultation  with  the  Committee,
considers that there is merit in a representation or objection made by
an interested party but additional information on the representation or
objection is required, the Minister may, within 28 days of receipt of the
representation or objection, give the interested party an opportunity to
provide such information orally or in writing.

An interested party shall be given no less than 14 days’ written
(4)
notice  of  the  date  on  which  he  will  have  an  opportunity  to  provide
additional information pursuant to subsection (3).

The  Committee  shall,  in  making  a  recommendation  to  the
(5)
Minister in respect of an application for a licence, take into account any
representation or objection made in relation to the application that the
Minister considers to have merit.

For  the  avoidance  of  doubt,  nothing  in  this  section  entitles  an
(6)
interested party to have access to the application of any applicant for a
licence.”.
