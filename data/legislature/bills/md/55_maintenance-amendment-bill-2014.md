MAINTENANCE (AMENDMENT) ACT, 2014

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

The Maintenance Act came into effect on the 15th of March 1984 to provide a
scheme  for  single  mothers  to  obtain  maintenance  for  children  born  out  of
wedlock.  The  Act  provides  a  comprehensive  scheme  for  mothers  to  seek
maintenance by applying to magistrates’ court for an order against the biological
fathers of their children. Since the passage of this Act some thirty years ago, the
composition of the single parent family is now varied and as such the person
needing to seek maintenance for the child can now also be the father or another
person with guardianship of the child. The law must, in the best interest of the
child, provide for these changing realities.

Clause 1:

Clause 2:

Clause 3:

This clause gives the short title of the amending Act. It may
be cited as the Maintenance (Amendment) Act, 2014.

This  clause  amends  the  interpretation  section  of  the
Maintenance Act, Cap. 216 , hereafter referred to as the Act,
to define the terms “applicant”, “birth”, “DNA”, “DNA test”,
“father”, “mother” and “parent” to widen the Act’s scope of
application.

This  clause  amends  section  6  of  the  Act  to  expand  the
categories of people who can apply for maintenance to include
the  father  of  the  child  and  a  person  granted  custody  of  the
child . This section also lists matters that the Magistrate must
take into account, and ensures that the Magistrate investigates
the living circumstances of the child and where relevant the
Magistrate  is  empowered  to  make  orders  for  access  and
visitation for the child.

Clause 4:

This  clause  amends  section  7  of  the  Act  to  provide  a  time
frame for an application for maintenance; an application for

i

Maintenance (Amendment) Act, 2014

maintenance can be made anytime after the birth of the child
and before the child attains 18 years, unless section 15 of the
Act applies.

This Clause amends section 8 of the Act to ensure that people
who are single as a result of a void marriage may also make
an application for maintenance under the Maintenance Act.

This Clause amends section 9 of the Act to provide for DNA
tests  to  be  ordered  by  the  court  to  establish  paternity;  this
section  also  provides  for  paternity  tests  not  ordered  by  the
court to be submitted to the court as evidence.

This clause amends section 10 to make the provisions of that
section, subject to the section 9.

This clause amends section 11 of the Act to permit the Court
to make an order for the maintenance of the child to calculated
from the date of the birth of the child and to include reasonable
amounts for the costs of the delivery of the child, where the
applicant applies for maintenance within 3 months of the birth
of the child.

This  clause  amends  section  12  to  delete  the  words  “under
section 10” so that the application of the section is no longer
tied to section 10 but now applies to entire Act.

This clause amends section 13 to exclude the application of
this defence to situations where DNA evidence shows that the
person on the record is not the father of the child.

Clause 5:

Clause 6:

Clause 7:

Clause 8:

Clause 9:

Clause 10:

Clause 11:

This  clause  amends  section  17  of  the  Act  to  expand  the
circumstances in which a maintenance order ceases to operate.

ii

Clause 12:

Clause 13:

Clause 14:

Clause 15:

Clause 16:

Clause 17:

Maintenance (Amendment) Act, 2014

This clause amends section 19 of the Act to ensure that it will
apply to either parent or the guardian of the child, as the case
may be, so that any party can apply for a modification of a
maintenance order.

This clause amends section 20 of the Act to ensure that both
parents are equally liable to maintain the child in accordance
with section 4, in circumstances where the child is not in the
custody of either parent.

This amends section 22 of the Act to provide for the Child
Care Board to seek maintenance from either parent of a child.

This clause amends section 24 of the Act to ensure that either
parent is liable for funeral expenses in the event of the death
of the child.

This clause amends section 26 of the Act to ensure that section
26 will now apply to either parent of a child.

This clause amends section 27 of the Act to ensure that section
27 applies to either parent of the child.
