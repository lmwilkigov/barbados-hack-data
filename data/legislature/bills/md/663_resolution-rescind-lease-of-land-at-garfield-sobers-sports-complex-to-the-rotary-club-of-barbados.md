ADDENDUM

  On  the  8th  day  of  March,  2012  the  Cabinet  agreed  to  the  lease  to  the  Rotary  Club

Barbados South of a parcel of land situate at Garﬁ eld Sobers Sports Complex, Wildey in the

parish of Christ Church in this Island and containing approximately 25 000 square feet for the

creation of a recreational facility for children with disabilities.

  On the 4th day of June, 2015, the Cabinet approved the introduction into Parliament of a

Resolution seeking approval for the lease.

The  Resolution  was  passed  by  the  Honourable  House  of Assembly  on  the  23rd  day  of

June,  2015  and  by  the  Honourable  Senate  on  the  8th  day  of  July,  2015,  was  assented  to  by

Her Excellency Governor-General on the 28th day of July, 2015 and was published in the Oﬃ  cial

Gazette as Resolution No. 20/2015 on the 3rd day of August, 2015.

The Ministry of Housing, Lands and Rural Development was subsequently advised that

there  was  no  good  and  proper  registration  of  the  organization  known  as  the  Rotary  Club  of

Barbados South and that the entity known as Rotary Inclusive Play Trust had been incorporated

to manage the aﬀ airs of the leased site.

  The name of the unregistered entity had its origins in the initial negotiation stages for

the grant of the lease and thereafter found its way into the related documentation.

The  approval  of  Parliament  is  therefore  now  sought  for  the  recission  of  Resolution

No. 20/2015.
