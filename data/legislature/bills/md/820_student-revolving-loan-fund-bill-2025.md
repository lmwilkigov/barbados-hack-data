to the person who owes the unpaid sums of money, in a certificate called a “Notice
of Unpaid Debt Certificate” the sums of money due and owing by that person.

16

or make arrangements for the payment of the sums of money, the Board may file
the Certificate in the High Court or the Magistrate’s Court for District ‘A’ and
the Certificate shall be registered in the court in which the Certificate is filed.

Subject to subsection (6), the Certificate has, after the expiration of 7 days

the third party shall pay to the Board the sums of money otherwise payable by

other payment until the liability of the person owed under this Act is satisfied or

is sooner.

Where the Board delivers a demand to a third party under subsection (1),
(4)
the third party shall pay to the Board, on account of the liability under this Act
of a person who is an officer or an employee of the third party, the sums of money
otherwise  payable  by  the  third  party  to  that  person  as  salary,  wages  or  other
remuneration and the third party shall continue to do so until the amount due to
that person is exhausted or until the amount demanded by the Board is satisfied,
whichever is sooner.

A receipt issued by the Board for the sums of money paid as required under
(5)
this section is sufficient to discharge, to the extent of the payment, the liability
of the third party to the person.

18

(6)
A third party who fails to comply with a requirement under subsections
(1), (2), (3) or (4) is liable to pay to the Board an amount equal to the amount that
the third party was required to pay to the Board under subsection (1).

(7)
Where an amount that would otherwise have been payable by a third party
to  a  person  is  paid  by  the  third  party  to  the  Board  pursuant  to  a  demand  for
payment  letter  served  on  the  person  under  subsection  (1)  or  pursuant  to  an
assessment of an amount payable by the third party under subsection (6), the
person shall be deemed for all purposes to have paid the amount to the Board on
behalf of that person.
