(4)
refusal shall give reasons for the refusal.

The  Crown  is  exempt  from  any  liability  in  negligence  arising
(5)
from  the  grant  of  planning  permission  for  building  operations  and
issuance of a building permit, whether or not the plans submitted in
application for planning permission or a building permit were prepared
by a competent registered professional or any other person.

Building Inspections

The holder of a building permit shall give to the Director
44B.(1)
notice in writing of the date on which building works will commence,
at least 14 days prior to the commencement of building operations.

During the carrying out of such works, the following building

(2)
inspections shall be conducted

15

(3)
Building works at an inspection stage shall not be covered up
prior to being inspected and further building works shall not proceed
unless the works completed up to that stage have been inspected and
approved.

Subject to subsection (5), all such inspections shall be conducted
(4)
by  an  independent  consultant  engaged  by  the  holder  of  the  building
permit to conduct such inspections.

Notwithstanding  subsection  (4),  where  a  building  permit  is
(5)
issued in relation to a simple building application, the required building
inspections  maybe  carried  out  by  a  building  officer  from  the
Department,  at  the  request  of  the  holder  of  the  building  permit,  on
payment of the prescribed fee for such inspections.

Where inspections are to be carried out by a building officer, the
(6)
builder may cover up uninspected building works where an inspection
is not carried out by a building officer within a period of 4 complete
working days after notice in writing has been given to the Director that
the uncovered building work will be ready for inspection in 3 working
days.

Where the holder of a building permit appoints an independent
(7)
consultant  to  conduct  the  required  inspections,  notice  of  such
appointment shall be included in the notice of intention to commence
works given to the Director pursuant to subsection (1).

Where  building  inspections  are  conducted  by  an  independent
(8)
consultant, the cost of the services of independent consultant engaged
by the holder of the building permit shall be borne by the holder of the
building  permit,  and  the  holder  of  the  building  permit  shall  submit
reports  on  the  building  inspections  to  the  Board  in  a  format  to  be
determined by the Director.

Where, at any stage in the course of a building inspection, the
(9)
independent  consultant  or  building  officer  identifies  defects  in  the

16

works being inspected, the defects shall be pointed out immediately to
the person charged with carrying out the building works and notice in
writing of the defects shall be given to holder of the building permit
within 24 hours thereafter.

Where, in the opinion of the Director, based on the inspection
(10)
reports, the building works do not comply with the Building Code or
the  approved  plans  and  specifications,  the  Board  may  by  notice  in
writing direct the person charged with carrying out the building works
to  take  such  steps  as  are  necessary  to  bring  the  building  works  into
compliance, within the time specified in the notice.

Where the person charged with carrying out the building works
(11)
refuses or fails to take such steps as are necessary to bring the building
works into compliance within the time specified in the notice, the Board
may revoke the building permit pursuant to section 44F(1).

In  this  section  “independent  consultant”  means  a  registered
(12)
professional  other  than  the  registered  professional  who  certified  the
plans  and  specifications  submitted  to  the  Board  and  who  is  not  an

Variations in building works

Where any material alteration or modification to the design
44C.(1)
of a building occurs in course of carrying out building works, revised
plans  showing  the  variations  from  the  original  plans,  including  the
addition, omission or substitution of any works, shall be submitted to
the Board as soon as may be practicable after the variation has occurred.

The  Board  may  amend  the  building  permit  to  authorise  any
(2)
variations to the original plans and the retention of the building as built
before the date of submission of the revised plans.

Where variations have occurred, no occupancy certificate shall
(3)
be issued for the building pursuant to section 44E until after the revised
plans have been submitted and the building permit has been amended.

17

(4)
Where revised plans are duly submitted to the Board, the Director
shall issue the amended building permit within 28 calendar days from
the date of submission of the revised plans.

(5)
The provisions of this section do not apply to the retention of
building works carried out without the grant of planning permission,
for which an application to regularise unauthorised development shall
be made pursuant to section 31.

Clarification of technical requirements

Where  any  question  arises  as  to  whether  technical
44D.(1)
requirements of the Building Code or any regulations are satisfied, a
registered professional shall consult with the Board and the views of
the Director shall be considered in all circumstances.

Where there is a dispute, between the Director and a registered
(2)
professional, with respect to the technical requirements of the Building
Code or any regulations, or as to whether there has been substantial
compliance with such requirements, any party to dispute may apply to
the Tribunal for a determination of the matter.

The  Tribunal  may  determine  any  dispute  brought  under
(3)
subsection  (2)  on  the  basis  of  written  submissions  alone,  but  shall
provide an opportunity for the parties to make oral representations on
a request in writing by either party.

The Tribunal may appoint an independent expert to advise it on
(4)
analysing the submissions made by the parties to any dispute, orally or
in writing, and in determining the question.

Occupancy Certificates

44E.(1)

No person shall

(a)

occupy

(i)

a new or renovated building; or

18

(ii)

a new extension to a building; or

(b)

permit any such new, renovated or extended building, to be
occupied

until  an  occupancy  certificate  has  been  issued  with  respect  to  the
building.

The  Board  shall  within  7  days

issue  an  occupancy
(2)
certificate  upon  the  completion  of  any  building  works  in  substantial
compliance with the terms of a building permit, and upon payment of
the prescribed fee.

An application for an occupancy certificate shall be made to the
(3)
Board in such form as is specified by the Board, accompanied by proof
of payment of the prescribed fee, and shall be submitted to the Director
by the owner of the building or by an agent for the owner, after the
completion of the building works.

The  Board  shall  not  grant  an  occupancy  certificate  unless  the
(4)
application is accompanied by a final inspection certificate duly signed
by  an  independent  consultant  or  a  building  officer  stating  that  the
building work to which it relates has been carried out in accordance
with the building permit, this Act and the building regulations, and is
fit for occupation.

An owner of a building or an agent for the owner may apply for
(5)
a temporary certificate of occupancy for part of a building which may
be safely occupied prior to completion of the rest of the building.

A temporary certificate of occupancy shall be granted subject to
(6)
such terms and conditions as the Director sees fit and remain valid for
such period from the date of issue as is specified therein.

In  subsection  (2),  “substantial  compliance”  means  a  level  of
(7)
compliance in which any deficiencies in the building works pose no
threat  to  the  safety,  health  and  welfare  of  persons  within  or  in  the

19

vicinity of the building greater than the potential for causing minimal
harm.

Enforcement of building control

44F.(1)
where

(a)

The Board may by notice in writing revoke a building permit

after  a  building  permit  is  issued  in  reliance  of  the  design
certificate of a registered professional, the building plans are
found  to  contravene  the  Building  Code  or  building
regulations;

(b)

(c)

the  permit  was  issued  based  upon  the  submission  of
materially false or misleading information;

the building works authorized by the building permit have
not, in the opinion of the Director, substantially commenced
before the lapse of the planning permission; or

(d)

the  building  works  are  being  carried  out  in  breach  of  the
building permit.

The Board shall not revoke a building permit under subsection

(2)
(1) on the grounds of any such default unless the Board has

(a)

(b)

by notice served on the holder of the permit, given not less
than 14 days notice of its intention to revoke the permit on
the grounds specified therein;

in  the  notice  referred  to  in  paragraph  (a)  specified  a
reasonable date before which the holder of the permit may
submit any written representations to the Board; and

(c)

taken into account

(i)

any action taken by the holder of the permit to remedy
such default, if it can be remedied, and to prevent the
reoccurrence of similar defaults; and

20

(ii)

any representations submitted to the Board pursuant to
paragraph (b).

(3)
Where  any  building  or  other  structure  is  commenced  or
completed without a building permit, or after a building permit has been
revoked, the Board may serve the owner of the premises or the builder,
or both of them, with a notice in writing specifying the contravention
and  requiring  the  person  served,  on  or  before  a  day  specified  in  the
notice,  to  show  cause  why  such  building  or  structure  should  not  be
removed, altered or demolished.

Where an owner or builder upon whom a notice has been served
(4)
pursuant  to  subsection  (3)  fails  to  show  sufficient  cause  why  the
building  or  other  structure  should  not  be  removed,  altered  or
demolished,  the  Board  may  cause  such  building  or  structure  to  be
removed, altered or pulled down.

Notice  in  writing  of  the  Board’s  decision  with  respect  to  the
(5)
removal, alteration or demolition of the building or structure, shall be
given to the owner of the premises at least 28 days before any such
action is undertaken.

All  expenses  incurred  by  the  Board  in  removing,  altering  or
(6)
pulling down a building or structure under this section shall be a civil
debt due to the Crown, recoverable in a court of competent jurisdiction,
and a charge upon the premises.

A person who is aggrieved by a notice served upon them under
(7)
subsection (1) or subsection (5) may appeal to the Tribunal within 14
days of the date of service of a notice.

Nothing  in  this  section  shall  be  construed  to  prevent  any
(8)
enforcement proceedings for a breach of planning control being taken
against any person under Part VIII of this Act, provided that no one
shall be punished twice for the same offence.
