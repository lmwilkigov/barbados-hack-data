 L.R.O. 1998  (6) The mole  The mole, symbol mol, is the SI unit of amount of substance. One mole contains   exactly 6.022 140 76 × 1023 elementary entities. This number is the ﬁ xed numerical   value of the Avogadro constant, NA, when expressed in the unit mol–1 and is called   the Avogadro number.  The amount of substance, symbol n, of a system is a measure of the number of  speciﬁ ed elementary entities.

The exact expression for the mole is:      (7)  The candela  The candela, symbol cd, is the SI unit of luminous intensity in a given direction. It   is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the luminous efficacy of   monochromatic radiation of frequency 540 × 1012 Hz, Kcd, to be 683 when expressed   in the unit lm W–1, which is equal to cd sr W–1, or cd sr kg–1 m–2 s3, where the kilogram,   metre and second are deﬁ ned in terms of h, c and ∆vCs.

 L.R.O. 19983. Derived Units(1) Derived units are deﬁ ned as products of powers of the base units. When the numerical factor of the product is one, the derived units care called coherent derived units. The base and coherent derived units of the SI form a coherent set, designated the set of coherent SI units. Since there are a limitless number of quantities it is impossible to provide a complete list of derived units however the most commonly used derived units are provided in paragraphs (2), (3) and (4).(2) The 22 SI derived units with special names and symbols.First Schedule - (Cont'd)Derived Quantityplane anglesolid anglefrequencyforcepressure, stressenergy, work, quantity of heatpower, radiant ﬂ uxelectric charge,quantity of electricityelectric potential diﬀ erence (e), volt electromotive forcecapacitanceSpecial name of unitRadian (b)Steradian (c)Hertz (d)newtonpascaljoulewattcoulombvoltfaradSymbolradsrHzNPaJWCVFUnit expressed in terms of base units (a)m/mm2/m2s-1kg m s-2kg m-1 s-2kg m2 s-2kg m2 s-3A skg m2 s-3 A-1kg-1 m-2 s4 A2Units expressed in terms of other SI UnitsN mJ/sW/AC/V56

The intention was to reﬂ ect the underlying physics of the corresponding quantity    equations although for some more complex derived units this may not be   possible.57

 L.R.O. 1998  (b) The radian is the coherent unit for plane angle.  One radian is the angle subtended    at the centre of a circle by an arc that is equal in length to the radius.  It is also the    unit for phase angle.  For periodic phenomena, the phase angle increases by 2π rad    in one period.  The radian was formerly an SI supplementary unit, but this category    was abolished in 1995.  (c) The steradian is the coherent unit for solid angle.  One steradian is the solid angle    subtended at the centre of a sphere by an area of the surface that is equal to the    squared radius.  Like the radian, the steradian was formerly an SI supplementary    unit.  (d) The hertz shall only be used for periodic phenomena and the becquerel shall    only be used for stochastic processes in activity referred to a radionuclide.  (e) Electric potential diﬀ erence is also called “voltage” in many countries, as well    as “electric tension” or simply “tension” in some countries.  (f) The degree Celsius is used to express Celsius temperatures. The numerical    value of a temperature diﬀ erence or temperature interval is the same when    expressed in either degrees Celsius or in kelvin.  (g) In photometry the name steradian and the symbol sr are usually retained in    expressions for units.  (h) Activity referred to a radionuclide is sometimes incorrectly called radioactivity.  (i) See CIPM Recommendation 2 on the use of the sievert (PV, 2002, 70, 205).(3) The seven base units and 22 units with special names and symbols may be   used in combination to express the units of other derived quantities. Since the   number of quantities is without limit, it is not possible to provide a complete list   of derived quantities and derived units. Subsection (4) provides some examples   of derived quantities and the corresponding coherent derived units expressed in   terms of base units.  In addition, subsection (5) provides examples of coherent derived   units whose names and symbols also include derived units.  The complete set of SI units   includes both the coherent set and the multiples and sub-multiples formed by using   the SI preﬁ xes.First Schedule - (Cont'd)58

(b) For some applications such as in astronomy, small angles are measured in    arcseconds (i.e. seconds of plane angle), denoted as or ″, milliarcseconds,    microarcseconds and picoarcseconds, denoted mas, μas and pas, respectively,    where arcsecond is an alternative name for second of plane angle.  (c) The unit hectare and its symbol ha, were adopted by the CIPM in 1879    (PV, 1879, 41). The hectare is used to express land area.  (d) The litre and the symbol lower-case l, were adopted by the CIPM in 1879 (PV,    1879, 41). The alternative symbol, capital L, was adopted by the 16th CGPM    (1979, Resolution 6; CR, 101 and Metrologia, 1980, 16, 56-57) in order to    avoid the risk of confusion between the letter l (el) and the numeral 1 (one).  (e) The tonne and its symbol t, were adopted by the CIPM in 1879 (PV, 1879, 41).    This unit is sometimes referred to as “metric ton” in some English-speaking    countries.62

 L.R.O. 1998First Schedule - (Concl'd)  (f) The dalton (Da) and the uniﬁ ed atomic mass unit (u) are alternative names    (and symbols) for the same unit, equal to 1/12 of the mass of a free carbon 12    atom, at rest and in its ground state. This value of the dalton is the value    recommended in the CODATA 2014 adjustment. It will be updated in the    CODATA 2018 adjustment to take into account the, now ﬁ xed, 2017 value of    the Planck constant h. This will reduce the 2014 uncertainty by an order of    magnitude.  (g) The electronvolt is the kinetic energy acquired by an electron in passing through   a potential diﬀ erence of one volt in vacuum. The electronvolt is often combined    with the SI preﬁ xes.  (h) In using these units it is important that the nature of the quantity be speciﬁ ed    and that any reference value used be speciﬁ ed.63

The names and symbols of these multiple and sub-multiple   preﬁ xes are presented in subsection (3).(2) Preﬁ x symbols are printed in upright typeface, as are unit symbols, regardless of   the typeface used in the surrounding text and are attached to unit symbols without   a space between the preﬁ x symbol and the unit symbol. With the exception of da   (deca), h (hector) and k (kilo), all multiple preﬁ x symbols are upper-case letters and all sub-multiple preﬁ x symbols are lowercase letters.

The symbol of the preﬁ x is therefore considered to be combined with the symbol of the unit to which it is directly attached, forming with it a new unit symbol which can be raised to a positive or negative power and which be combined with other unit symbols to form the symbols for compound units.(5) Compound preﬁ xes, formed by the juxtaposition of several SI preﬁ xes, are not  permitted.68

 L.R.O. 1998Third Schedule - (Concl'd)(6) The names and symbols of the decimal multiples and sub-multiples of the unit of mass are formed by the addition of the SI preﬁ xes to the word “gram” (symbol g). 1 g = 0.001 kg = 10-3 kg.(7) To designate the decimal multiples and sub-multiples and sub-multiples of a derived unit which is expressed in a form of a fraction, a preﬁ x can be attached indiﬀ erently to the units which appear either in the numerator, or in the denominator, or in both of these terms.69

Fees For Verification Work And For Registration Of Servicemen

(Sections 29(3), 38 and 52 )

Additional Fees for Verification Work

The following fees are to be collected for the examination and stamping of the measuring

instruments indicated below:

1. The extra sum of $100.00 is to be charged where the inspector is required to issue a
written certificate in respect of the compliance of the measuring instrument to this Act without
mentioning the true value of the measure or the true values of the indications of the measuring
instrument.

2.  In  case  the  where  measuring  instrument  fails  to  pass  the  assessment  50  per  cent  fee

prescribe is to be collected for the examination.

Note : The fees do not include the cost of transportation of the inspector and the verification
equipment. If such costs have been incurred they are to be charged additionally according to
the actual costs.
