an insurance certificate in respect of the ship.

(2)

An application under subsection (1)

(a)

(b)

shall be in the prescribed form; and

shall be lodged with a prescribed person.

Where an application is made under subsection (1) in respect of a ship, the
(3)
Administration shall issue to the applicant an insurance certificate in respect of
the ship, if he is satisfied that the owner of the ship is maintaining insurance or
other equivalent financial security in respect of the ship in an amount that will
cover the limits of liability prescribed under the International Convention on Civil
Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1992, as amended.

(4)

An insurance certificate issued under subsection (3) in respect of a ship

25.(1)

Where

(a)

(b)

a ship in respect of which an insurance certificate has been issued under
section 24 is not at a port in Barbados at the time when the certificate
expires or is about to expire; and

the Administration is satisfied that, after the expiration day specified
in the certificate, there will be in force a contract of insurance or other
financial security in respect of the ship in an amount that will cover the
limits  of  liability  prescribed  under  the  Convention,  as  amended,  in
relation to the ship,

the Administration may extend the certificate for a period that expires on or before
the day that the Administration is satisfied is the last day in the balance of the
period  during  which  that  contract  of  insurance  or  other  equivalent  financial
security is to remain in force, or a period that does not exceed one month from
the day referred to in paragraph (b), whichever is the earlier.

An  extension  of  an  insurance  certificate  under  subsection  (1)  is  of  no

(2)
further force or effect after the arrival of the ship at a port in Barbados.

The  Administration  may  cancel  an  insurance  certificate  issued  under
(3)
section 24 that is in force in respect of a ship, if he is satisfied that, by reason of
a modification to the contract of insurance or variation of other financial security
in respect of the ship, the owner of the ship will not be covered for an amount
that  satisfies  the  limits  of  liability  prescribed  under  the  1992  Convention,  as
amended, in relation to the ship.

If, while an insurance certificate issued under section 24 in respect of a
(4)
ship registered in Barbados or in a country to which the International Convention
on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1992, as amended, does not apply
is in force, the ship ceases to be registered in Barbados or in that country, as the
case may be, the certificate ceases to be in force.

31

(5)
Where an insurance certificate issued under section 24 in respect of a ship
is cancelled under subsection (3) or ceases to be in force by virtue of subsection
(4),  the  master  of  the  ship  shall  lodge  the  certificate  with  the  Administration
without delay.

The owner, master or agent of a ship referred to in section 24 who operates
(6)
the ship without an insurance certificate that is in force commits an offence and
is liable on summary conviction to a fine of $20 000.

Government ships

In relation to a ship owned by Barbados, the Administration may issue
26.(1)
a certificate certifying that the ship is owned by Barbados and that any liability
for pollution damage up to the limits of liability applicable in relation to the ship
prescribed  by  under  the  International  Convention  on  Civil  Liability  for  Oil
Pollution Damage, 1992, as amended, will be met by Barbados.

At the request of a state party to the 1992 Convention, as amended, the
(2)
Administration may issue a certificate in relation to a ship owned by the state
certifying

(a)

(b)

that the ship is owned by the state; and

if the Administration is satisfied that any liability for pollution damage
up to the limits of liability prescribed under the 1992 Convention, as
amended, will be met by the state party, that any such liability will be
met by the state party.

Subject to subsection (4), a certificate issued under subsection (1) or (2)

(3)
remains in force for the period specified in the certificate.

If, while a certificate issued under subsection (1) or (2) in respect of a ship
(4)
owned by Barbados or by a state party to the 1992 Convention, as amended, is
in force, the ship ceases to be owned by Barbados or the state party, the certificate
ceases to be in force.

A country to which the 1992 Convention, as amended, applies shall, in any
(5)
proceedings brought in a court in Barbados to enforce a claim in respect of a

32

liability  incurred  under  provisions,  be  deemed  to  have  submitted  to  the
jurisdiction of that court and to have waived any defence based on its status as a
sovereign  country,  but  nothing  in  this  subsection  shall  permit  the  levy  of
execution against the property of such a country.

Barbados at a time when the ship is not carrying on board a relevant insurance
certificate  in  respect  of  the  ship,  the  officer  may  detain  the  ship  until  such  a
certificate is obtained or produced to the officer.

The master of a ship detained at a port under subsection (3), and the owner

cancel the detention notice; or

affirm  it  with  such  modifications  as  the  arbitrator  may  in  the
circumstances think fit.

(a)

(b)

the matter complained of did not constitute a valid basis for the officer’s
opinion; and

there  were  no  reasonable  grounds  for  the  issuance  of  the  detention
notice,

the arbitrator shall award the owner of the ship such compensation in respect of
any loss suffered in consequence of the detention of the ship as the arbitrator
thinks fit.
