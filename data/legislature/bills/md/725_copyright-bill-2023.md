29.(1)
signed by or on behalf of the prospective owner of the copyright, the prospective

Where a name purporting to be that of the author appeared on a work
50.(1)
when it was made or on copies of the published work, it shall be presumed that
the person whose name appeared on the work is the author of the work and also
the owner of the copyright in the work, until the contrary is proved.

Subsection (1) applies to each person alleged to be one of the authors, in

(2)
the case of an alleged work of joint authorship.

(3)

Where no name purporting to be that of the author appeared on a work but

(a)

(b)

pursuant to section 9(1), the work qualifies for copyright protection by
virtue of the country of first publication; and

a name purporting to be that of the publisher appeared on the copies of
the work as first published,

66

it  shall  be  presumed  that  the  person  whose  name  appeared  was  the  owner  of
copyright at the time of publication, until the contrary is proved.

Where the author of a work is dead or where the identity of the author
(4)
cannot  be  ascertained  by  reasonable  inquiry,  it  shall  be  presumed,  until  the
contrary is proved

(a)

(b)

that the work is an original work; and

that the claimant's allegations as to what was the first publication of
the work and as to the country of first publication are correct.

Presumptions where action relates to sound recordings, films or
computer programs

51.(1)
copies of the recording issued to the public bear a label or other mark stating

Where  an  action  is  brought  with  respect  to  a  sound  recording,  and

(a)

(b)

that a named person was the owner of copyright in the recording at the
date of issue of the copies; or

that the recording was first published in a specified year or in a named
country,

the  label  or  mark  is  admissible  as  evidence  of  the  facts  stated  and  shall  be
presumed to be correct until the contrary is proved.

Where an action is brought with respect to a film, and copies of the film

(2)
issued to the public bear a statement

(a)

(b)

(c)

that a named person was the author or director of the film;

that a named person was the owner of copyright in the film at the date
of issue of the copies; or

country,

the statement is admissible as evidence of the facts stated and shall be presumed
to be correct until the contrary is proved.

(3)
of the program are issued to the public in electronic form bearing a statement

(a)

(b)

that a named person was the owner of copyright in the program at the
date of issue of the copies; or

that the program was first published in a named country or that copies
of it were first issued to the public in electronic form in a specified year,

the statement is admissible as evidence of the facts stated and shall be presumed
to be correct until the contrary is proved.

The presumptions specified in subsections (1), (2) and (3) apply equally
(4)
in an action relating to an infringement alleged to have occurred before the date
on which the copies were issued to the public as those presumptions apply to an
action relating to an infringement alleged to have occurred on or after that date.

Where an action is brought with respect to a film, and the film as shown

(5)
in public, or communicated to the public bears a statement

(a)

(b)

that a named person was the author or director of the film; or

that a named person was the owner of copyright in the film immediately
after it was made,

the statement is admissible as evidence of the facts stated and shall be presumed
to be correct until the contrary is proved and the presumption applies equally in
an action relating to an infringement alleged to have occurred before the date on
which the film was shown in public or communicated to the public as it applies
in an action relating to an infringement alleged to have occurred on or after that
date.

may apply to the Tribunal for the grant of a licence.

A person who in a claim excluded from a licensing scheme, claims that the

the scheme provides for the grant of licences subject to terms excepting
matters from the licence and the case falls within such an exception;

before the expiry date.

The Tribunal shall on an application for review confirm or vary its order

applicable in accordance with the licensing scheme or the circumstances of the
case.

Effect of order of Tribunal as to licensing scheme

103.(1)
A licensing scheme that has been confirmed or varied by the Tribunal
under section 98 or 99 shall be in force or remain in operation so far as it relates
to the description of case in respect of which the order was made, so long as the
order remains in force.

While the order is in force a person who is in a case of a class to which the

(2)
order applies

(a)

pays  to  the  operator  of  the  scheme  any  charges  payable  under  the
scheme in respect of a licence covering the case in question or, if the
amount cannot be ascertained, gives an undertaking to the operator to
pay the operator when ascertained; and

99

(b)

complies with the other terms applicable to such a licence under the
scheme,

shall be in the same position as regards infringement of copyright or infringement
of performer’s property rights as if that person had at all material times been the
holder of a licence granted by the owner of the copyright or the rights in question.

The Tribunal may direct that the order, so far as it varies the amount of the
(3)
charges payable, shall have effect from a date before that on which it is made,
not being a date earlier than the date on which the reference was made or where
the scheme came into operation after the reference was made, not being a date
earlier  than  the  date  on  which  the  scheme  came  into  operation  but  no  such
direction may be made where subsection (5) applies.

(4)

If a direction is made under subsection (3)

(a)

(b)

any  necessary  repayments,  or  further  payments,  shall  be  made  in
respect of charges already paid; and

the  reference  in  subsection  (2)(a)  to  the  charges  payable  under  the
scheme shall be construed as a reference to the charges so payable by
virtue of the order.

Any order of the Tribunal under section 98 or 99 made with respect to a
(5)
scheme that is certified for any purpose under section 100 has effect, so far as it
varies the scheme by reducing the charges payable for licences, from the date on
which the reference was made to the Tribunal.

Where  the  Tribunal  makes  an  order  under  section  101    and  the  order
(6)
remains in force, the person in whose favour the order is made shall, if he satisfies
the  conditions  specified  in  subsection  (7),  be  in  the  same  position  as  regards
infringement of copyright or infringement of performer’s property rights as if he
had at all material times been the holder of a licence granted by the owner of the
copyright or rights in question.

The conditions referred to in subsection (6) are that the person mentioned

in that subsection shall

undertaking to pay the charges when ascertained; and

(b)

comply with the other terms specified in the order.

The Tribunal shall first decide whether to entertain the reference referred
to in subsection (1) and may decline to do so on the ground that the reference is
premature.

as the Tribunal may determine.

Reference to Tribunal of expiring licence

A licensee under a licence which is due to expire by effluxion of time

(2)
licence is due to expire.

A licence in respect of which a reference has been made to the Tribunal

(3)
shall remain in operation until proceedings on the reference are concluded.

If the Tribunal finds that it is unreasonable in the circumstances that the
(4)
licence  should  cease  to  be  in  force,  it  shall  make  an  order  declaring  that  the
licensee shall continue to be entitled to the benefit of the licence on such terms
as the Tribunal may determine to be reasonable in the circumstances.

An order of the Tribunal under this section may be made so as to be in

(5)
force indefinitely or for such period as the Tribunal may determine.

as  regards  infringement  of  copyright  or  infringement  of  performer’s  rights  as

owner of the copyright or the performer’s property rights in question on the terms
specified in the order.

(2)

The conditions referred to in subsection (1) are that the person shall

(a)

pay to the licensing body any charges payable in accordance with the
order or, if the amount cannot be ascertained, give an undertaking to

before that on which it was made, not being a date earlier than the date
on which the reference or application was made; or

where a licence was granted or was due to expire after the reference
was made, not being a date earlier than the date on which the licence
