EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

SUMMARY
The  purpose  of  this  Bill  is  to  make  fuller  provision  for  the  prevention  of  the
smuggling  of  persons  in  the  terms  of  the  Protocol  against  the  Smuggling  of
Migrants  by  Land,  Sea  and  Air,  supplementing  the  United  Nations  Convention

Against Transnational Organized Crime.

The creation of offences related to the smuggling of persons in the Immigration Act
now reflects the fact that the offences created are essentially immigration offences and
that prevention lies in strong border control.

Notwithstanding  the  title  of  the  Protocol,  the  emphasis  of  the  Protocol  is  on  the
smuggling of persons by sea. This is clearly expressed in Part II (Articles 7 to 9) of the
Protocol which is headed “smuggling of migrants by sea”. There are no provision of
the Protocol which expressly deal with smuggling by air or land.

This Bill must be read with the Trafficking in Persons Prevention Bill, 2015 and the
Criminal  Assets  Recovery  Fund  Bill,  2015  which  provide  for  other  aspects  of  the

Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime.

Clause 2: Amendment of section 12A
The amendment to this section increases the penalty of imprisonment from to 2 years
to  5  years.  The  amendment  also  removes  two  existing  ambiguities.  Firstly,  by
providing for the offence to be tried on indictment, it makes it clear that the offence is
not to be tried summarily. Secondly, it removes the conflict that the general penalty in
section 30 applied to the offence under this section.

Clause 3: Insertion of new section 29A (offences of the smuggling of persons)

1

This  provision  implements  Article  6  of  the  Protocol  which  requires  states  to
criminalize  the  smuggling  of  migrants  especially  where  false  travel  and  identity
documents are used.

Subsection (1): offence of the smuggling of persons
Subsection (1) creates an offence of the smuggling of persons simpliciter.

Subsection (2): offence of the smuggling of persons with aggravation
Subsection (2) creates an offence of the smuggling of persons with aggravation. This
implements  Article  6  (3)  of  the  Protocol  which  requires  that  a  special  offence  be
created  where  the  lives  of  person  are  endangered  or  where  persons  are  subjected  to
inhuman or degrading treatment. These circumstances would include for example, the
overcrowding  of  migrant  boats,  the  insufficiency  of  ventilation,  food  and  water  and
the infliction of physical abuse.

Insertion of new section 29B: Penalties
This  clause  provides  heavy  penalties  in  relation  to  the  offences  prescribed  under
section  29A.  A  heavier  penalty  is  prescribed  in  relation  to  the  offence  of  the
smuggling of persons with aggravation.

Insertion of new section 29B: Forfeiture
This clause implements Articles 12, 13 and 14 of the Convention by providing for the
forfeiture of assets where an offence of smuggling of persons is committed.

Clause: 4 Amendment of section 30 (General penalties)
This amendment clarifies the law by removing an ambiguity relating to the mode of
trial  of  the  offences  under  the  Act  and  the  imposition  of  the  general  penalty.  The
amendment now makes it clear that the general penalty does not apply to any of the
indictable  offences  under  the  Act  and  secondly,  that  the  mode  of  trial  for  those
offences to which the general penalty applies is by way of summary trial.

Clause: 5 Amendment of the Extradition Act, Cap. 189
This clause would make the offence of smuggling of persons an extraditable offence.
