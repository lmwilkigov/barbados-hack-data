It is important to note that the Cabinet did not express any intention to abolish

the death penalty.

The Inter-American Court of Human Rights in Case 12645: Tyrone Dacosta
Cadagon v. Barbados, raised concerns about the assessment of the mental state
of the accused as it relates to the following:

(a)

(b)

(c)

a person’s fitness to plead;

raising defences such as diminished responsibility; or

the trial judge’s responsibility in ensuring that assessments are made
to facilitate the raising of such defences.2

In  a  separate  judgment,  Judge  Sergio  García  Ramírez,  asserted  that  judges
should intervene in trials to raise the submission of evidence to support defences
like diminished responsibility, especially in circumstances where the penalty to
be imposed is death.3  Judge Ramírez insisted that the adverserial nature of a
