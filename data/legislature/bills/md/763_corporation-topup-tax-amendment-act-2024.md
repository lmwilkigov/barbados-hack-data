The  top-up  tax,  referred  to  in  subsection  (2),  shall  be  paid  into  the

(5)
Consolidated Fund.

determined  to  be  located  in  the  jurisdiction  where  it  is  treated  as  a
permanent establishment and is liable to tax under the applicable tax
treaty;

as  defined  in  section  2,  paragraph  (b)  of  the  definition  shall  be
determined to be located in the jurisdiction where it is subject to net
basis taxation based on its business presence;

as  defined  in  section  2,  paragraph  (c)  of  the  definition  shall  be
determined to be located in the jurisdiction where it is situated;

as  defined  in  section  2,  paragraph  (d)  of  the  definition  shall  be
considered to be stateless.

Where a constituent entity is located in Barbados and another jurisdiction
(5)
and that jurisdiction has an applicable tax treaty with Barbados, the constituent
entity shall be deemed to be located in the jurisdiction where it is considered to
be resident for tax purposes under that tax treaty.

(6)

Where

(a)

(b)

the applicable tax treaty referred to in subsection (5) requires that the
competent  authorities  reach  a  mutual  agreement  on  the  deemed
residence for tax purposes of the constituent entity, and no agreement
is reached; or

there is no relief for double taxation under the applicable tax treaty,
referred to in subsection (5), due to the fact that a constituent entity is
resident for tax purposes in both contracting parties

subsection (7) shall apply;

26

(7)
Where a constituent entity is located in Barbados and another jurisdiction
and that jurisdiction does not have an applicable tax treaty with Barbados, the
constituent entity shall be deemed to be located in the jurisdiction which charged
the higher amount of covered taxes for the fiscal year.

For the purpose of computing the amount of covered taxes referred to in
(8)
the subsection (7), the amount of tax paid in accordance with a controlled foreign
company tax regime shall not be taken into consideration.

If the amount of covered taxes due in Barbados and another jurisdiction is
(9)
the  same  or  zero,  the  constituent  entity  shall  be  deemed  to  be  located  in  the
jurisdiction where it has the higher amount of substance-based income exclusion
computed on an entity basis in accordance with section 31.

If the amount of the substance-based income exclusion in Barbados and
(10)
another jurisdiction is the same or zero, the constituent entity shall be considered
to be stateless, unless it is an ultimate parent entity, in which case it shall be
deemed to be located in the jurisdiction where it was created.

Where a constituent entity changes its location in the course of a fiscal
(11)
year, it shall be deemed to be located in the jurisdiction where it was deemed to
be located under this section at the beginning of that fiscal year.

Currency conversion

Every amount relevant to the computation of the qualifying income
8.(1)
or  loss  of  a  qualifying  entity  for  a  fiscal  year  should  be  consistent  with  the
reporting currency as defined in subsection (4).

If an amount that is relevant to the computation of the qualifying income
(2)
or loss of a qualifying entity for a fiscal year is denominated in a currency other
than  the  reporting  currency  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the
ultimate parent entity of the qualifying entity and is not converted to the relevant
reporting  currency  in  the  course  of  preparing  the  consolidated  financial
statements, that amount is to be converted to the relevant reporting currency using
the foreign currency translation principles of the financial accounting standard
that  would  have  been  used  to  convert  the  amount  to  the  relevant  reporting

27

currency  if  that  conversion  were  undertaken  in  the  course  of  preparing  the
consolidated financial statements.

Notwithstanding the generality of subsection (1), when determining if any
(3)
materiality or other threshold in this Act that is denominated in the currency of
the European Monetary Union is satisfied or exceeded by an amount in respect
of a group, entity or jurisdiction for a particular fiscal year, the amount is to be
converted from that currency to the currency of the European Monetary Union
using the average of the daily rates of exchange, in respect of the 2 currencies for
the  month  of  December  included  in  the  fiscal  year,  one  year  immediately
preceding the particular fiscal year, as determined by the Central Bank.

For the purposes of this section “reporting currency” means the relevant
(4)
reporting  currency  utilised  in  the  course  of  the  preparation  of  a  consolidated
financial statement.

PART III

COMPUTATION OF QUALIFYING INCOME OR LOSS

Determination of qualifying income or loss

Determination of qualifying income or loss

9.(1)
For the purposes of this section, the income or loss of a qualifying
entity is the financial accounting net income or loss determined for the qualifying
entity for the fiscal year adjusted for the items described in sections 10 to 22.

Financial  accounting  net  income  or  loss  is  the  net  income  or  loss
(2)
determined for a qualifying entity for the fiscal year, before any consolidation
adjustments  eliminating  intra-group  transactions,  in  preparing  consolidated
financial statements of the ultimate parent entity.

Where it is not reasonably practicable to determine the financial accounting
(3)
net  income  or  loss  of  a  qualifying  entity  based  on  the  acceptable  financial

28

accounting  standard  or  authorised  financial  accounting  standard  used  in  the
preparation of the consolidated financial statements of the ultimate parent entity,
the financial accounting net income or loss of the qualifying entity for the fiscal
year may be determined using another acceptable financial accounting standard
or an authorised financial accounting standard provided that

(a)

the financial accounts of the qualifying entity are maintained based on
that accounting standard;

(b)

the information contained in the financial accounts is reliable; and

(c)

permanent  differences  in  excess  of  €1  000  000  that  arise  from  the
application of a particular principle or standard to items of income or
expense or transactions, where that principle or standard differs from
the  financial  standard  used  in  the  preparation  of  the  consolidated
financial  statements  of  the  ultimate  parent  entity,  are  adjusted  to
conform to the treatment required for that item under the accounting
standard  used  in  the  preparation  of  the  consolidated  financial
statements.

11.(1)
the amount allowed as a deduction for the computation of its taxable income in
its location for the amount expensed in its financial accounts for a cost or expense
of such qualifying entity that was paid with stock-based compensation.

Where  the  option  to  use  the  stock-options  has  not  been  exercised,  the
(2)
amount of stock-based compensation cost or expense that has been deducted from
the  financial  accounting  net  income  or  loss  of  the  qualifying  entity  for  the
computation of its qualifying income or loss for all previous fiscal years shall be
included in the fiscal year in which that option has expired.

Where part of the amount of stock-based compensation cost or expense
(3)
has been recorded in the financial accounts of the qualifying entity in fiscal years
prior to the fiscal year in which the election is made, an amount equal to the
difference between the total amount of stock-based compensation cost or expense
that has been deducted for the computation of its qualifying income or loss in
those previous fiscal years and the total amount of stock-based compensation
cost  or  expense  that  would  have  been  deducted  for  the  computation  of  its
qualifying income or loss in those previous fiscal years if the election had been
made in such fiscal years shall be included in the computation of the qualifying
income or loss of the qualifying entity for that fiscal year.

33

(4)
The election shall be made in accordance with section 44(1) and shall apply
consistently to all qualifying entities located in the same jurisdiction for all years
in which the election is applicable.

(5)
In the fiscal year in which the election is revoked, the amount of unpaid
stock-based compensation cost or expense deducted pursuant to the election that
exceeds  the  financial  accounting  expense  accrued  shall  be  included  in  the
computation of the qualifying income or loss of the qualifying entity.

Arm’s Length Principle adjustment to determine qualifying income
or loss

12.(1)

Any transaction between constituent entities

(a)

(b)

located in Barbados; or

not located in Barbados,

that  is  not  recorded  in  the  same  amount  in  the  financial  accounts  of  both
constituent entities, that is not consistent with the arm’s length principle, shall be
adjusted so as to be in the same amount and consistent with the arm’s length
principle.

Where  a  loss  from  a  sale  or  other  transfer  of  an  asset  arises  between  2
(2)
constituent  entities  that  is  not  recorded  consistently  with  the  arm’s  length
principle, that loss shall be adjusted based on the arm’s length principle if the
loss is included in the computation of the qualifying income or loss.

For  the  purposes  of  this  section,  “arm’s  length  principle”  means  the
(3)
principle under which transactions between constituent entities are to be recorded
by  reference  to  the  conditions  that  would  have  been  obtained  between

Tax credit adjustment to determine qualifying income or loss

13.(1)
computation of the qualifying income or loss of a qualifying entity.

A qualified refundable tax credit shall be treated as income for the

34

A non-qualified refundable tax credit shall not be treated as income for the

(2)
computation of the qualifying income or loss of a qualifying entity.

Fair value or impairment adjustment to determine qualifying income
or loss

At the election of the filing entity, gains and losses in respect of assets
14.(1)
and  liabilities  that  are  subject  to  fair  value  or  impairment  accounting  in  the
consolidated financial statements for a fiscal year may be determined on the basis
of the realisation principle for the computation of the qualifying income or loss.

Gains  or  losses  which  result  from  applying  fair  value  or  impairment
(2)
accounting  in  respect  of  an  asset  or  a  liability  shall  be  excluded  from  the
computation of the qualifying income or loss of a qualifying entity under the
subsection (1).

The carrying value of an asset or a liability for the purpose of determining
(3)
a gain or a loss under the subsection (1) shall be the carrying value at the time
the asset was acquired or the liability was incurred, or on the first day of the fiscal
year in which the election is made, whichever date is the latest.

The election shall be made in accordance with section 44(1) and shall apply
(4)
to all qualifying entities located in the jurisdiction to which the election is made,
unless the filing entity chooses to limit the election to the tangible assets of the
qualifying entities or to investment entities.

In the fiscal year in which the election is revoked, an amount equal to the
(5)
difference between the fair value of the asset or liability and the carrying value
of the asset or liability on the first day of the fiscal year in which the revocation
is made, determined pursuant to the election, shall be included, if the fair value
exceeds the carrying value, or deducted, if the carrying value exceeds the fair
value,  for  the  computation  of  the  qualifying  income  or  loss  of  the  qualifying
entities.

35

Tangible asset gain or loss adjustment to determine qualifying income
or loss

15.(1)
At the election of the filing entity, the qualifying income or loss of a
qualifying entity arising from the disposal of tangible assets by the qualifying
entity to third parties, other than a member of the group, for a fiscal year may be
adjusted as set out in this section.

The net gain shall be offset first against the net loss, if any, that has arisen

(2)
in the earliest fiscal year of the five-year period.

Any residual amount of net gain shall be carried forward and offset against
(3)
any net losses that have arisen in subsequent fiscal years of the five-year period.

Any residual amount of net gain that remains shall be spread evenly over
(4)
the five-year period for the computation of the qualifying income or loss of each
qualifying entity located in that jurisdiction that has made a net gain from the
disposal of tangible assets as referred to in the subsection (1) in the fiscal year in
which the election is made.

The residual amount of net gain allocated to a qualifying entity shall be
(5)
proportionate to the net gain of that qualifying entity divided by the net gain of
all qualifying entities.

Where  no  qualifying  entity  has  made  a  net  gain  from  the  disposal  of
(6)
tangible  assets  as  referred  to  in  subsection  (1)  in  the  fiscal  year  in  which  the
election is made, the residual amount of net gain as referred to subsections (4)
and (5) shall be allocated equally to each qualifying entity and spread evenly over
the five-year period for the computation of the qualifying income or loss of each
of those qualifying entities.

Any adjustment under this section for the fiscal years preceding the fiscal
(7)
year in which the election is made shall be subject to adjustments in accordance
with section 32.

(8)

The election shall be made annually in accordance with section 44(2).

For the purposes of this section,

36

“tangible assets” means immovable property located in the same jurisdiction as

the constituent entity;

“five-year  period”  means  the  period  in  which  the  net  gain  arising  from  the
disposal of tangible assets as referred to in the subsection (1), in the fiscal
year in which the election is made, shall be offset against any net loss of a
qualifying  entity  located  in  that  jurisdiction  arising  from  the  disposal  of
tangible assets

(a)

(b)

in the fiscal year in which the election is made; and

in the 4 fiscal years prior to that fiscal year.

Intra-group financing arrangement adjustment to determine
qualifying income or loss

Any expense related to a intra-group financing arrangement shall not
16.(1)
be taken into consideration in the computation of the qualifying income or loss
of a qualifying entity if the following conditions are met:

(a)

(b)

(c)

it  can  reasonably  be  anticipated  that,  the  intra-group  financing
arrangement will, over its expected duration, increase the amount of
expenses  taken  into  account  in  the  computation  of  the  qualifying
income or loss of that qualifying entity;

it  can  reasonably  be  anticipated  that  the  intra-group  financing
arrangement would not result in a commensurate increase in the taxable
income of the counter party;

the  counterparty  is  located  in  a  jurisdiction  that  is  not  a  low-tax
jurisdiction or in a jurisdiction that would not have been low-taxed if
the  income  related  to  the  expense  had  not  been  accrued  by  the
counterparty; and

37

(d)

the qualifying entity has an ETR below 15 per cent or an ETR that
would have been below 15 per cent if the expense had not been accrued
by the qualifying entity.

(2)

For the purposes of this section

“intra-group financing arrangement” means a financing arrangement whereby
one or more constituent entities provides credit to or otherwise makes an
investment in one or more other constituent entities of the same group;

“counter party” means the constituent entity providing the credit.

Election to consolidate transactions in the same jurisdiction

An  ultimate  parent  entity  may  elect  to  apply  its  consolidated
17.(1)
accounting  treatment  to  eliminate  income,  expense,  gains,  and  losses  from
transactions between qualifying entities and included in a tax consolidation group
for the purpose of computing the net qualifying income or loss of those qualifying
entities.

(2)

The election shall be made in accordance with section 44.

In the fiscal year in which the election is made or revoked, appropriate
(3)
adjustments shall be made so that items of qualifying income or loss are not taken
into  consideration  more  than  once  or  omitted  as  a  result  of  such  election  or
revocation.

Insurance companies adjustment to determine qualifying income or
loss

18.(1)
An  insurance  company  shall  exclude  from  the  computation  of  its
qualifying income or loss any amount charged to policyholders for taxes paid by
the insurance company in respect of returns to the policyholders.

An insurance company shall include in the computation of its qualifying
(2)
income or loss any returns to policyholders that are not reflected in its financial
accounting net income or loss to the extent that the corresponding increase or

38

decrease in liability to the policyholders is reflected in its financial accounting
net income or loss.

Additional tier one capital adjustment to determine qualifying income
or loss

An amount recognised as a decrease to the equity of a qualifying entity
19.(1)
attributable to distributions paid or payable in respect of additional tier one capital
issued by the qualifying entity shall be treated as an expense in the computation
of its income or loss.

An amount recognised as an increase to the equity of a qualifying entity

international shipping income of a qualifying entity shall be excluded from the
computation of its qualifying income or loss, provided that the qualifying entity
demonstrates that the strategic or commercial management of all ships concerned
is effectively carried on from within Barbados.

Where  the  computation  of  a  qualifying  entity’s  international  shipping
(2)
income and qualified ancillary international shipping income results in a loss,
such  loss  shall  be  excluded  from  the  computation  of  the  qualifying  entity’s
qualifying income or loss.

The  aggregated  qualified  ancillary  international  shipping  income  of  all
(3)
qualifying  entities  shall  not  exceed  50  per  cent  of  those  qualifying  entities’
international shipping income.

international shipping activities listed in the definition of international
shipping income referred to in subsection (7); and

qualified  ancillary  international  shipping  activities  listed  in  the
definition of qualified ancillary international shipping income referred
to in subsection (7)

shall  be  allocated  to  such  activities  for  the  purpose  of  computing  the  net
international  shipping  income  and  the  net  qualified  ancillary  international
shipping income of the qualifying entity.

The  costs  incurred  by  a  qualifying  entity  that  indirectly  result  from  its
(5)
international  shipping  activities  and  qualified  ancillary  international  shipping
activities  shall  be  deducted  from  the  qualifying  entity’s  revenues  from  such
activities to compute the international shipping income and qualified ancillary
international shipping income of the constituent entity on the basis of its revenues
from such activities in proportion to its total revenues.

All direct and indirect costs attributed to a qualifying entity’s international
(6)
shipping  income  and  qualified  ancillary  international  shipping  income  in

Allocation of qualifying income or loss

Allocation of qualifying income or loss between a main entity and a
permanent establishment

21.(1)
A permanent establishment’s financial accounting net income or loss
shall be the net income or loss reflected in the separate financial accounts of that
permanent establishment.

Where  a  permanent  establishment  does  not  have  separate  financial
(2)
accounts, its financial accounting net income or loss shall be the amount that
would  have  been  reflected  in  its  separate  financial  accounts  if  they  had  been
prepared on a standalone basis and in accordance with the accounting standard
used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements of the ultimate
parent entity.

A permanent establishment’s financial accounting net income or loss shall
(3)
be adjusted to reflect only the amounts and items of income and expense that are
attributable  to  it  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  tax  treaty  or  enactment,
regardless of the amount of income subject to tax and the amount of deductible
expenses.

The financial accounting net income or loss of a permanent establishment
(4)
shall not be taken into account in determining the qualifying income or loss of
the main entity, except as provided in subsection (5).

A loss of a permanent establishment shall be treated as an expense of the
(5)
main entity (and not of the permanent establishment) for purposes of computing
its  qualifying  income  or  loss  to  the  extent  that  the  loss  of  the  permanent
establishment is treated as an expense in the computation of the domestic taxable
income of such main entity and is not set off against an item of income that is
subject to tax under the laws of both the jurisdiction of the main entity and the
jurisdiction of the permanent establishment.

Qualifying  income  that  is  subsequently  arising  in  the  permanent
(6)
establishment shall be treated as qualifying income of the main entity (and not

42

of the permanent establishment) up to the amount of the qualifying loss that was
previously treated as an expense of the main entity under the subsection (5).

Allocation of qualifying income or loss from a flow-through entity

22.(1)
The financial accounting net income or loss of a constituent entity that
is a flow-through entity shall be reduced by the amount allocable to its owners
that are not constituent entities and that hold their ownership interest in such flow-
through  entity  directly  or  through  one  or  more  of  the  tax  transparent  entities,
unless

(a)

(b)

the flow-through entity is an ultimate parent entity; or

the flow-through entity is held, directly or through a tax transparent
structure by an ultimate parent entity referred to in paragraph (a).

The financial accounting net income or loss of a constituent entity that is
(2)
a flow-through entity shall be reduced by the financial accounting net income or
loss that is allocated to another constituent entity.

Where  a  flow-through  entity  wholly  or  partially  carries  out  business
(3)
through a permanent establishment, its financial accounting net income or loss
which remains after applying the formulae referred to in subsection (1) shall be
allocated to that permanent establishment.

Where  a  flow-through  entity  is  a  tax  transparent  entity  that  is  not  the
(4)
ultimate parent entity, the financial accounting net income or loss of the flow-
through entity which remains after applying the formulae set out subsection (1)
and (3) shall be allocated to its constituent entity-owners in accordance with their
ownership interests in the flow-through entity.

Where a flow-through entity is a tax transparent entity that is the ultimate
(5)
parent entity, any financial accounting net income or loss of the flow-through
entity  which  remains  after  applying  the  allocation  to  any  permanent
establishment shall be allocated to the ultimate parent entity.

Where  a  flow-through  entity  is  a  reverse  hybrid  entity,  any  financial
(6)
accounting net income or loss of the flow-through entity which remains after

43

applying the formulae set out in subsections (1) and (3) shall be allocated to the
reverse hybrid entity.

Subsections (3), (4) and (5) shall be applied separately with respect to each

(7)
ownership interest in the flow-through entity.

Adjusted covered taxes

24.(1)
The adjusted covered taxes of a qualifying entity for a fiscal year shall
be  determined  by  adjusting  the  sum  of  the  current  tax  expense  accrued  in  its

The reductions to the covered taxes of a qualifying entity for the fiscal year

(3)
shall include

the  amount  of  current  tax  expense  with  respect  to  income  excluded
from the computation of qualifying income or loss under Part III;

45

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

any amount of credit or refund in respect of a non-qualified refundable
tax  credit  that  was  not  recorded  as  a  reduction  to  the  current  tax
expense;

any amount of covered taxes refunded or credited to a qualifying entity
that  was  not  treated  as  an  adjustment  to  current  tax  expense  in  the
financial accounts, unless it relates to a qualified refundable tax credit;

the  amount  of  current  tax  expense  that  relates  to  an  uncertain  tax
position; and

any amount of current tax expense that is not expected to be paid within
3 years after the end of the fiscal year.

An amount referred to in subsections (1), (2) and (3) shall only be taken

(4)
into account once for the purpose of computing adjusted covered taxes

Where, in a fiscal year, there is no net qualifying income and the amount
(5)
of adjusted covered taxes is negative and less than an amount equal to the net
qualifying  loss  multiplied  by  the  minimum  tax  rate,  the  amount  equal  to  the
difference  between  the  amount  of  adjusted  covered  taxes  and  the  amount  of
expected adjusted covered taxes shall be treated as an additional current top-up
tax for that fiscal year.

The  amount  of  additional  current  top-up  tax  shall  be  allocated  to  each

(6)
qualifying entity in the jurisdiction in accordance with section 31.

Total deferred tax adjustment amount

25.(1)
Where the tax rate applied for the purpose of computing the deferred
tax  expense  is  equal  or  below  the  minimum  tax  rate,  the  total  deferred  tax
adjustment amount to be added to the adjusted covered taxes of a qualifying entity
for a fiscal year pursuant to section 24(1)(b), shall be the deferred tax expense
accrued  in  its  financial  accounts  with  respect  to  covered  taxes,  subject  to  the
adjustments under subsections (3) to (6).

Where the tax rate applied for the purpose of computing the deferred tax
(2)
expense is above the minimum tax rate, the total deferred tax adjustment amount

46

to be added to the adjusted covered taxes of a qualifying entity for a fiscal year
pursuant  to  section  24(1)(b),  shall  be  the  deferred  tax  expense  accrued  in  its
financial accounts with respect to covered taxes recast at the minimum tax rate,
subject to the adjustments under subsections (3) to (6).

(3)

The total deferred tax adjustment amount shall be increased by:

(a)

(b)

any amount of unclaimed accrual paid during the fiscal year; and

any  amount  of  recaptured  deferred  tax  liability  determined  in  a
preceding fiscal year that has been paid during the fiscal year.

Where, in a fiscal year, a loss deferred tax asset is not recognised in the
(4)
financial accounts because the recognition criteria are not met, the total deferred
tax adjustment amount shall be reduced by the amount that would have reduced
the total deferred tax adjustment amount if a loss deferred tax asset for the fiscal
year had been accrued.

(5)

The total deferred tax adjustment amount shall not include

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

the amount of deferred tax expense with respect to items excluded from

Where  a  deferred  tax  asset  that  is  attributable  to  a  qualifying  loss  of  a
(6)
qualifying  entity  has  been  recorded  in  a  fiscal  year  at  a  rate  lower  than  the
minimum tax rate, it may be recast at the minimum tax rate in the same fiscal

47

year, provided that the taxpayer is able to demonstrate that the deferred tax asset
is attributable to a qualifying loss.

Where a deferred tax asset is increased pursuant to the subsection (6), the

(7)
total deferred tax adjustment amount shall be reduced accordingly.

A deferred tax liability that is not reversed and whose amount is not paid
(8)
within the 5 subsequent fiscal years shall be recaptured to the extent it was taken
into account in the total deferred tax adjustment amount of a qualifying entity.

The  amount  of  the  recaptured  deferred  tax  liability  determined  for  the
(9)
current fiscal year shall be treated as a reduction to the covered taxes in the fifth
fiscal year preceding the current fiscal year, and the effective tax rate and top-up
tax of that fiscal year shall be recomputed in accordance with section 31.

The recaptured deferred tax liability in the current fiscal year shall be the
(10)
amount of the increase in the category of deferred tax liability that was included
in the total deferred tax adjustment amount in the fifth fiscal year preceding the
current fiscal year that has not reversed by the end of the last day of the current
fiscal year.

Notwithstanding subsection (7), where a deferred tax liability is a recapture
(11)
exception accrual, it shall not be recaptured even if it is not reversed or paid within
the 5 subsequent years.

(12)
that is attributable to changes in associated deferred tax liabilities, in respect of
the following items

as the qualifying entity that are reinvested in tangible property in the
same jurisdiction; and

(i)

additional amounts accrued as a result of accounting principal changes
with respect to items listed in paragraphs (a) to (h).

(13)

For the purposes of this section,

“disallowed accrual” means

(a)

(b)

any  movement  in  deferred  tax  expense  accrued  in  the  financial
accounts  of  a  qualifying  entity  which  relates  to  an  uncertain  tax
position; and

any  movement  in  deferred  tax  expense  accrued  in  the  financial
accounts of a qualifying entity which relates to distributions from a
qualifying entity;

“unclaimed accrual” means any increase in a deferred tax liability recorded in
the  financial  accounts  of  a  qualifying  entity  in  a  fiscal  year  that  is  not
expected to be paid within the time period set out in subsections (8), (9) and
(10) and which the filing entity annually elects, in accordance with section
44 not to include in the total deferred tax adjustment amount for such fiscal
year.

Qualifying loss election

26.(1)
Notwithstanding section 25, a filing entity may make a qualifying loss
election  according  to  which  a  qualifying  loss  deferred  tax  asset  shall  be
determined in each fiscal year in which there is a net qualifying loss.

49

Pursuant to subsection (1), the loss deferred tax asset shall be equal to the

(2)
net qualifying loss in a fiscal year multiplied by the minimum tax rate.

(3)
The qualifying loss deferred tax asset determined pursuant to subsection
(1) shall be used in any subsequent fiscal year in which there is net qualifying
income  is  an  amount  equal  to  the  net  qualifying  income  multiplied  by  the
minimum tax rate or, if lower, the amount of qualifying loss deferred tax asset
that is available.

The qualifying loss deferred tax asset determined pursuant to subsection
(4)
(1) shall be reduced by the amount that is used in a fiscal year and the balance
shall be carried forward to subsequent fiscal years.

Where a qualifying loss election is revoked, any remaining qualifying loss
(5)
deferred tax asset determined pursuant to subsection (1) shall be reduced to zero
as of the first day of the first fiscal year in which the qualifying loss election is
no longer applicable.

The  qualifying  loss  election  shall  be  filed  with  the  first  top-up  tax

(6)
information return, referred to in section 45, of the qualifying entity.

Where  a  flow-through  entity  which  is  the  ultimate  parent  entity  of  a
(7)
qualifying  entity  makes  a  qualifying  loss  election  under  this  section,  the
qualifying loss deferred tax asset shall be computed by reference to the qualifying
loss of the flow-through entity after reduction pursuant to section 41.

Specific allocation of covered taxes incurred by certain types of
constituent entities

27.(1)
A  permanent  establishment  shall  be  allocated  the  amount  of  any
covered taxes that are included in the financial accounts of a constituent entity
and  that  relate  to  qualifying  income  or  loss  of  that  permanent  establishment
excluding main entity taxes.

(2)

The covered taxes of a constituent entity shall exclude the amount of

(a)

any main entity taxes relating to a permanent establishment;

50

(b)

(c)

(d)

any taxes charged under a controlled foreign company tax regime in
respect of the income of the constituent entity;

any covered taxes included in the financial accounts of a constituent
entity owner relating to the qualifying income of a hybrid entity;

any covered taxes accrued in the financial accounts of a constituent
entity’s direct constituent entity owners in respect of distributions from
the  constituent  entity,  except  for  withholding  tax  levied  on  such
distributions.

A constituent entity owner shall be allocated the amount of any covered
(3)
taxes that are included in the financial accounts of a tax transparent entity and
that relate to qualifying income or loss allocated to the constituent entity-owner
in accordance with section 22(4).

A constituent entity that made a distribution during the fiscal year shall be

(4)
allocated the amount of any withholding tax levied on such distribution.

Where the qualifying income of a permanent establishment is treated as
(5)
qualifying income of the main entity in accordance with section 21, any covered
taxes arising in the jurisdiction where the permanent establishment is located and
associated with such income shall be treated as covered taxes of the main entity
for an amount not exceeding such income multiplied by the highest tax rate on
ordinary income in the jurisdiction where the main entity is located.

(6)

For the purposes of this section

“hybrid  entity”  means  an  entity  treated  as  a  separate  person  for  income  tax
purposes in the jurisdiction where it is located but as fiscally transparent in
the jurisdiction in which its owner is located;

“main entity taxes” means any covered taxes that are included in the financial
accounts of a constituent entity and that relate to the qualifying income or
loss  of  a  permanent  establishment  and  which  were  imposed  by  the
jurisdiction in which that permanent establishment’s main entity is located.

51

Post-filing adjustments and tax rate changes

28.(1)
Where a qualifying entity records an adjustment to its covered taxes
in a previous fiscal year in its financial accounts, such adjustment shall be treated
as an adjustment to covered taxes in the fiscal year in which the adjustment is
made, unless the adjustment relates to a fiscal year in which there is a decrease
in covered taxes.

Where  there  is  a  decrease  in  covered  taxes  that  were  included  in  the
(2)
qualifying entity’s adjusted covered taxes for a previous fiscal year, the effective
tax rate and top-up tax for such fiscal year shall be recomputed in accordance
with section 32(1) and (2) by reducing adjusted covered taxes by the amount of
the decrease in covered taxes and the qualifying income for the fiscal year and
any previous fiscal years shall be adjusted accordingly.

At the annual election of the filing entity, made in accordance with section
(3)
44, an immaterial decrease in covered taxes may be treated as an adjustment to
covered taxes in the fiscal year in which the adjustment is made.

An immaterial decrease in covered taxes shall be an aggregate decrease of
(4)
less than €1 000 000 in the adjusted covered taxes determined for the jurisdiction
for the fiscal year.

Where the applicable domestic tax rate is reduced below the minimum tax
(5)
rate  and  such  reduction  results  in  a  deferred  tax  expense,  the  amount  of  the
resulting deferred tax expense shall be treated as an adjustment to the qualifying
entity’s liability for covered taxes that are taken into consideration pursuant to
section 24 for a previous fiscal year.

Where a deferred tax expense was taken into account at a rate lower than
(6)
the minimum tax rate and the applicable tax rate is later increased, the amount
of  deferred  tax  expense  that  results  from  such  increase  shall  be  treated  upon
payment  as  an  adjustment  to  a  qualifying  entity’s  liability  for  covered  taxes
claimed for a previous fiscal year in accordance with section 24.

52

The adjustment under subsection (6) shall not exceed an amount equal to

(7)
the deferred tax expense recast at the minimum tax rate.

(8)
Where more than €1 000 000 of the amount accrued by a qualifying entity
as current tax expense and included in adjusted covered taxes for a fiscal year is
not paid within 3 years after the end of that fiscal year, the effective tax rate and
top-up tax for the fiscal year in which the unpaid amount was claimed as a covered
tax shall be recomputed in accordance with section 32(1) and (2) by excluding
such unpaid amount from the adjusted covered taxes.

PART V

COMPUTATION OF THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND TOP-UP TAX

Determination of the effective tax rate

The effective tax rate of a DMTT Group shall be computed, for each
29.(1)
fiscal year, provided that there is net qualifying income, in accordance with the
following formula:

Effective
tax rate

= adjusted covered taxes of qualifying entities

net qualifying income of qualifying entities

where the adjusted covered taxes of the DMTT Group are the sum of the adjusted
covered taxes of all the qualifying entities located in the jurisdiction determined
in accordance with Part IV.

The net qualifying income or loss of the DMTT Group in the jurisdiction
(2)
for a fiscal year shall be determined in accordance with the following formula:

53

Net qualifying income or loss = qualifying income of the qualifying entities —
qualifying losses of qualifying entities

where

(a)

the qualifying income of the DMTT Group is the positive sum, if any,
of  the  qualifying  income  of  all  qualifying  entities  located  in  the
jurisdiction determined in accordance with Part III;

(b)

the qualifying losses of the DMTT Group are the sum of the qualifying
losses of all qualifying entities determined in accordance with Part III.

Adjusted covered taxes and qualifying income or loss of qualifying entities
(3)
to  which  section  40  applies  shall  be  excluded  from  the  computation  of  the
effective tax rate in accordance with subsection (1) and the computation of the
net qualifying income in accordance with subsection (2).

The effective tax rate of each stateless constituent entity shall be computed,
(4)
for each fiscal year, separately from the effective tax rate of all other constituent
entities.

Computation of top-up tax

30.(1)
Where the effective tax rate of a DMTT Group is below the minimum
tax rate for an income year, the qualifying entities in that DMTT Group that have
qualifying income shall be liable to top-up tax.

The  top-up  tax  for  a  fiscal  year  shall  be  the  positive  amount,  if  any,

(2)
computed in accordance with the following formula:

Jurisdictional top-up tax=(top-up tax percentage x excess profit) + additional
current top-up tax

where the additional current top-up tax is the amount of tax as determined in
accordance with section 32 for the fiscal year.

The top-up tax percentage for a fiscal year shall be the positive percentage

(3)
point difference, if any, computed in accordance with the following formula:

54

Top-up tax percentage = minimum tax rate — effective tax rate

where the effective tax rate is the rate computed in accordance with section 29.

The  excess  profit  for  the  jurisdiction  for  the  fiscal  year  referred  to  in
(4)
subsection (3) shall be the positive amount, if any, computed in accordance with
the following formula:

Excess profit = net qualifying income — substance-based income exclusion

where the net qualifying income is the net qualifying income or loss determined
in accordance with section 29(2).

The top-up tax of a qualifying entity that is part of a DMTT Group for the
(5)
current fiscal year shall be computed in accordance with the following formula:

Top-up tax of a qualifying entity = jurisdictional top-up tax

x qualifying income of the qualifying entity
aggregate qualifying income of all qualifying entities

where:

(a)

(b)

the qualifying income of the qualifying entity for a fiscal year is the
income determined in accordance with Part III;

the aggregate qualifying income of all qualifying entities for a fiscal
year is the sum of the qualifying income of all the qualifying entities
for the fiscal year.

If the top-up tax results from a recomputation pursuant to section 32(1)
(6)
and (2) and there is no net qualifying income in the jurisdiction for the fiscal year,
the top-up tax shall be allocated to each qualifying entity using the formula set

55

out in subsection (5), based on the qualifying income of the qualifying entities
in the fiscal years for which the recomputations pursuant to section 32(1) and (2)
are performed.

The top-up tax of each stateless constituent entity shall be computed, for
(7)
each fiscal year, separately from the top-up tax of all other constituent entities.

Substance-based income exclusion

31.(1)
Unless a filing entity of MNE group elects, in accordance with section
44, not to apply the substance-based income exclusion for the fiscal year, the net
qualifying  income  for  a  jurisdiction  shall  be  reduced,  for  the  purpose  of
computing the top-up tax, by an amount equal to the sum of the payroll carve-
out referred to in subsection (2) and the tangible asset carve-out referred to in
subsection (3) for each qualifying entity.

The payroll carve-out of a qualifying entity shall be equal to 5 per cent of
(2)
its  eligible  payroll  costs  of  eligible  employees  who  perform  activities  for  the
MNE group, with the exception of eligible payroll costs that are:

(a)

capitalised  and  included  in  the  carrying  value  of  eligible  tangible
assets;

(b)

attributable to income that is excluded in accordance with section 20.

The tangible asset carve-out of a qualifying entity shall be equal to 5 per
(3)
cent of the carrying value of the eligible tangible assets located in the jurisdiction,
with the exception of

(a)

(b)

the carrying value of property, including land and buildings, that is held
for sale, lease or investment;

the  carrying  value  of  tangible  assets  used  to  derive  income  that  is
excluded in accordance with section 20.

For the purposes of subsection (3)(b), the carrying value of eligible tangible
(4)
assets shall be the average of the carrying value of eligible tangible assets at the
beginning and end of the fiscal year, as recorded for the purpose of preparing the

56

consolidated financial statements of the ultimate parent entity, reduced by any
accumulated  depreciation,  amortisation  and  depletion  and  increased  by  any
amount attributable to the capitalisation of payroll expenses.

For  the  purposes  of  subsections  (2)  and  (3),  eligible  payroll  costs  and
(5)
eligible tangible assets of a qualifying entity which is a permanent establishment
shall be those that are included in its separate financial accounts in accordance
with section 21, provided that the eligible payroll costs and eligible tangible assets
are located in the same jurisdiction as the permanent establishment.

The  eligible  payroll  costs  and  eligible  tangible  assets  of  a  permanent
(6)
establishment shall not be taken into account for the eligible payroll costs and
eligible tangible assets of the main entity.

Where the income of a permanent establishment was wholly or partially
(7)
excluded pursuant to section 21(1) and section 38, the eligible payroll costs and
eligible tangible assets of such permanent establishment shall be excluded in the
same proportion from the computation under this section for the MNE group.

Eligible payroll costs of eligible employees paid by, and eligible tangible
(8)
assets owned by, a flow-through entity that are not allocated under paragraph 6
shall be allocated to:

(a)

(b)

the constituent entity-owners of the flow-through entity, in proportion
to the amount allocated to them pursuant to section 22(4), provided that
the eligible employees and eligible tangible assets are located in the
jurisdiction of the constituent entity-owners; and

the flow-through entity if it is the ultimate parent entity, reduced in
proportion  to  the  income  excluded  from  the  computation  of  the
qualifying income of the flow-through entity pursuant to section 41(1)
and  (2),  provided  that  the  eligible  employees  and  eligible  tangible
assets are located in the jurisdiction of the flow-through entity.

All  other  eligible  payroll  costs  and  eligible  tangible  assets  of  the  flow-
(9)
through  entity  shall  be  excluded  from  the  substance-based  income  exclusion
computations of the MNE group.

57

(10)
The substance-based income exclusion of each stateless constituent entity
shall  be  computed,  for  each  fiscal  year,  separately  from  the  substance-based
income exclusion of all other constituent entities.

(11)
The substance-based income exclusion computed under this section shall
not include the payroll carve-out and the tangible asset carve-out of constituent
entities that are investment entities in that jurisdiction.

For the purpose of applying subsection (2), the value of 5 per cent shall be
(12)
replaced by the values set out in column II of Part I of the First Schedule, for
each fiscal year beginning from the 31st of December of the calendar years set out
in column I of Part I of the First Schedule.

For the purpose of applying subsection (3), the value of 5 per cent shall be
(13)
replaced by the values set out in column II of Part II of the First Schedule, for
each fiscal year beginning from the 31st of December of the calendar years set out
in column I of Part II of the First Schedule.

(14)

For the purposes of this section,

“eligible  employees”  means  full-time  or  part-time  employees  of  a  qualifying

immovable  property  or  exploitation  of  natural  resources  that  entails
significant investment in tangible assets.

Additional current top-up tax

Where, pursuant to sections 15, 25(6), 28(1) and (8) and 41(8) and
32.(1)
(10), an adjustment to covered taxes or qualifying income or loss results in the
re-computation of the effective tax rate and top-up tax of the DMTT Group for
a prior fiscal year, the effective tax rate and top-up tax shall be re-computed in
accordance with the rules set out in sections 29, 30 and 31.

Any amount of incremental top-up tax arising from such re-computation
(2)
shall be treated as an additional current top-up tax for the purposes of section
30(3) for the fiscal year during which the re-computation is made.

Where an amount of additional current top-up tax is due pursuant to section
(3)
24(5)  it  shall  be  allocated  pro-rata  to  each  qualifying  entity,  based  on  the
following formula:

(Qualifying income or loss x minimum tax rate) — adjusted covered taxes

The  additional  current  top-up  tax  shall  only  be  allocated  to  qualifying
(4)
entities that record an amount of adjusted covered tax that is less than zero and
less than the qualifying income or loss of such qualifying entities multiplied by
the minimum tax rate.

Where  a  qualifying  entity  is  allocated  additional  current  top-up  tax  in
(5)
accordance with this section and section 30(5) and (6), such qualifying entity
shall be treated as a low-taxed constituent entity for the purposes of this Act.

59

De minimis exclusion

33.(1)
Notwithstanding sections 29 to 31 and section 35, at the election of
the filing entity, the top-up tax due for the constituent entities shall be equal to
zero for a fiscal year if, for such fiscal year:

(a)

(b)

the average qualifying revenue of the DMTT Group is less than €10
000 000; and

the average qualifying income or loss of the DMTT Group is a loss or
is less than €1 000 000.

The  election  referred  to  in  subsection  (1)  shall  be  made  annually  in

(2)
accordance section 44.

The  average  qualifying  revenue  or  average  qualifying  income  or  loss
(3)
referred  to  subsection  (1)  shall  be  the  average  of  the  qualifying  revenue  or
qualifying  income  or  loss  of  the  DMTT  Group  for  the  fiscal  year  and  the  2
preceding fiscal years.

If there are no qualifying entities with qualifying revenue or qualifying loss
(4)
in the first or second preceding fiscal year, or both, such fiscal year or years shall
be excluded from the computation of the average qualifying revenue or qualifying
income or loss.

The qualifying revenue of the DMTT Group for a fiscal year shall be the
(5)
sum of all the revenues of the qualifying entities, reduced or increased by any
adjustment carried out in accordance with Part III.

The qualifying income or loss of the qualifying entities for a fiscal year
(6)
shall be the net qualifying income or loss as computed in accordance with section
30(2).

The  de  minimis  exclusion  set  out  in  subsections  (1)  to  (4)  shall  not  be

(7)
applicable to stateless constituent entities and investment entities.

60

(8)
The revenue and qualifying income or loss of stateless constituent entities
and investment entities shall be excluded from the computation of the de minimis
exclusion.

Minority-owned constituent entities

The computation of the effective tax rate and the top-up tax applicable
34.(1)
to members of a minority-owned subgroup shall apply as if each minority-owned
subgroup were a separate MNE group.

The adjusted covered taxes and qualifying income or loss of members of

(2)

SPECIAL RULES FOR CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING AND HOLDING
STRUCTURES

Application of the consolidated revenue threshold to group mergers
and demergers

Where 2 or more groups merge to form a single group in any of the
35.(1)
last 4 consecutive fiscal years immediately preceding the tested fiscal year, the
consolidated revenue threshold of the MNE group shall be deemed to be met for
any fiscal year prior to the merger if the sum of the revenue included in each of
their consolidated financial statements for that fiscal year is €750 000 000 or
more.

Where an entity that is not a member of a group, referred to as the ‘target’,
(2)
merges with an entity or a group, referred to as the ‘acquiring entity’, in the tested
fiscal year, and either the target or the acquiring entity did not have consolidated
financial  statements  in  any  of  the  last  4  consecutive  fiscal  years  immediately
preceding the tested fiscal year, the consolidated revenue threshold of the MNE
group shall be deemed to be met for that year if the sum of the revenue included

62

in each of their financial statements or consolidated financial statements for that
fiscal year is €750 000 000 or more.

Where a single MNE group under this Act, demerges into 2 or more groups,
(3)
each referred to as a ‘demerged group’, the consolidated revenue threshold shall
be deemed to be met by a demerged group where:

(a)

(b)

with respect to the first tested fiscal year ending after the demerger, the
demerged group has an annual revenue of €750 000 000 or more in that
fiscal year;

with respect to the second to fourth tested fiscal years ending after the
demerger, the demerged group has an annual revenue of €750 000 000
or more in at least 2 of those fiscal years.

(4)

For the purposes of this section,

“merger” means any arrangement where:

(a)

(b)

all or substantially all of the group entities of 2 or more separate groups
are brought under common control in a way that they constitute entities
of a combined group; or

an entity that is not a member of any group is brought under common
control with another entity or group in a way that they constitute entities
of a combined group;

“demerger” means any arrangement where the group entities of a single group
are separated into 2 or more different groups that are no longer consolidated
by the same ultimate parent entity.

Constituent entities joining and leaving an MNE group

36.(1)
Where an entity, referred to as the “target’, becomes or ceases to be a
constituent entity of an MNE group, as a result of a transfer of direct or indirect
ownership interests in the target, or where the target becomes the ultimate parent
entity of a new group during a fiscal year, referred to the ‘acquisition year’, the
target shall be treated as a member of the MNE group for the purposes of this

63

Act provided that a portion of its assets, liabilities, income, expenses and cash
flows is included on a line-by-line basis in the consolidated financial statements
of the ultimate parent entity in the acquisition year.

The effective tax rate and top-up tax of the target, referred to in subsection

(2)
(1), shall be computed in accordance with subsections (3) to (9).

In the acquisition year, referred to in subsection (1), an MNE group shall
(3)
take into account only the financial accounting net income or loss and adjusted
covered taxes of the target, referred to in subsection (1), that are included in the
consolidated financial statements of the ultimate parent entity for the purposes
of this Act.

In the acquisition year, referred to in subsection (1), and in each subsequent
(4)
fiscal year, the qualifying income or loss and adjusted covered taxes of the target,
referred to in subsection (1), shall be based on the historical carrying value of its
assets and liabilities

In the acquisition year, referred to in subsection (1), the computation of
(5)
the eligible payroll costs of the target, referred to in subsection (1), pursuant to
section  31(2)  shall  take  into  account  only  the  costs  that  are  reflected  in  the
consolidated financial statements of the ultimate parent entity.

The computation of the carrying value of the eligible tangible assets of the
(6)
target, referred to in subsection (1), pursuant to section 31(3) shall be adjusted,
where applicable, in proportion to the period of time in which the target was a
member of the MNE group during the acquisition year referred to in subsection
(1).

With the exception of the qualifying loss deferred tax asset as referred to
(7)
in section 26, the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities of a target, referred
to in subsection (1), that are transferred between MNE groups shall be taken into
account by the acquiring MNE group and to the same extent as if the acquiring
MNE group controlled the target when such assets and liabilities arose.

Deferred tax liabilities of the target, referred to in subsection (1), that have
(8)
previously  been  included  in  its  total  deferred  tax  adjustment  amount  shall  be

64

treated  as  reversed,  for  the  purposes  of  section  25(8),  (9)  and  (10),  by  the
disposing  MNE  group  and  as  arising  from  the  acquiring  MNE  group  in  the
acquisition year, except that in such a case any subsequent reduction of covered
taxes pursuant to section 25(8), (9) and (10) shall have effect in the year in which
the amount is recaptured.

Notwithstanding  subsections  (1)  to  (8),  in  the  case  of  a  disposition  or
(9)
acquisition of assets and liabilities, a disposing qualifying entity shall include the
gain  or  loss  on  disposition  in  the  computation  of  its  income  or  loss  and  an
acquiring qualifying entity shall determine its income or loss using the acquiring
qualifying entity’s carrying value of the acquired assets and liabilities determined

An acquiring qualifying entity shall determine its qualifying income or loss
(2)
on the basis of its carrying value of the acquired assets and liabilities determined
under the financial accounting standard used in preparing consolidated financial
statements of the ultimate parent entity.

Notwithstanding subsection (2), where a disposal or acquisition of assets

(3)
and liabilities is performed in the context of a reorganisation

(a)

(b)

the disposing qualifying entity shall exclude any gain or loss arising
from such disposal from the computation of its qualifying income or
loss; and

the acquiring qualifying entity shall determine its qualifying income
or loss on the basis of the carrying value of the acquired assets and
liabilities of the disposing qualifying entity upon disposal.

65

(4)
Notwithstanding subsections (2) and (3), where the disposal of assets and
liabilities is performed in the context of a reorganisation which results, for the
disposing qualifying entity, in a non-qualifying gain or loss

(a)

(b)

the  disposing  qualifying  entity  shall  include  the  gain  or  loss  on  the
disposal in the computation of its qualifying income or loss to the extent
of the non-qualifying gain or loss; and

the acquiring qualifying entity shall determine its qualifying income
or  loss  after  the  acquisition  using  the  disposing  qualifying  entity’s
carrying value of the acquired assets and liabilities upon disposal, as
adjusted consistently with local tax rules of the acquiring qualifying
entity to account for the non-qualifying gain or loss.

At the election of the filing entity, where a qualifying entity is required or
(5)
permitted to adjust the basis of its assets and the amount of its liabilities to fair
value for tax purposes in the jurisdiction where it is located, such qualifying entity
may

(a)

include, in the computation of its qualifying income or loss, an amount
of gain or loss in respect of each of its assets and liabilities, which shall
be

(i)

equal to the difference between the carrying value for financial
accounting purposes of the asset or liability immediately before
the  date  of  the  event  that  triggered  the  tax  adjustment  (the
‘triggering  event’)  and  the  fair  value  of  the  asset  or  liability
immediately after the triggering event; and

(ii)

decreased (or increased) by the non-qualifying gain or loss, if any,
arising in connection with the triggering event;

(b)

use  the  fair  value  for  financial  accounting  purposes  of  the  asset  or
liability immediately after the triggering event to compute qualifying
income or loss in the fiscal years ending after the triggering event; and

66

(c)

include the net total of the amounts determined in paragraph (a) in the
qualifying entity’s qualifying income or loss in one of the following
ways:

(i)

(ii)

the net total of those amounts is included in the fiscal year in which
the triggering event occurs; or

an amount equal to the net total of those amounts divided by 5 is
included in the fiscal year in which the triggering event occurs and
in  each  of  the  immediate  4  subsequent  fiscal  years,  unless  the
qualifying entity leaves the MNE group in a fiscal year within this
period,  in  which  case  the  remaining  amount  will  be  wholly
included in that fiscal year.

(6)

For the purposes of this section,

“acquiring qualifying entity” means a qualifying entity that acquires assets and

liabilities

“disposing qualifying entity” means a qualifying entity that disposes of assets

and liabilities;

“reorganisation” means a transformation or transfer of assets and liabilities such

as in a merger, demerger, liquidation or similar transaction where:

(a)

equity interests issued by the acquiring qualifying entity or by a person
connected  with  the  acquiring  qualifying  entity,  or,  in  the  case  of  a
liquidation, equity interests of the target, or, when no consideration is
provided,  where  the  issuance  of  an  equity  interest  would  have  no
economic significance;

the  disposing  qualifying  entity’s  gain  or  loss  on  those  assets  is  not
subject to tax, in whole or in part; and

the tax laws in which the acquiring qualifying entity is located require
the  acquiring  qualifying  entity  to  compute  taxable  income  after  the
disposal or acquisition using the disposing qualifying entity’s tax basis

67

in  the  assets,  adjusted  for  any  non-qualifying  gain  or  loss  on  the
disposal or acquisition;

“non-qualifying gain or loss” means the lesser of the gain or loss of the disposing
qualifying entity arising in connection with a reorganisation that is subject

Joint ventures

The  computation  of  the  top-up  tax  on  a  joint  venture  and  its  joint
38.(1)

III to VII, as if they were qualifying entities of a separate MNE group and the
joint venture was the ultimate parent entity of that group.

For the purposes of this section, “joint venture group” means a joint venture

(2)
and its joint venture subsidiaries.

PART VII

TAX NEUTRALITY AND DISTRIBUTION REGIMES

Ultimate parent entity that is a flow-through entity

39.(1)
The  qualifying  income  of  a  flow-through  entity  that  is  an  ultimate
parent entity shall be reduced, for the fiscal year, by the amount of qualifying
income that is attributable to the ownership holder, provided that:

(a)

(b)

the ownership holder is subject to tax on such income for a taxable
period that ends within 12 months after the end of that fiscal year at a
nominal rate that equals or exceeds the minimum tax rate; or

it can be reasonably expected that the aggregated amount of adjusted
covered  taxes  of  the  ultimate  parent  entity  and  taxes  paid  by  the
ownership holder on such income within 12 months after the end of

68

the  fiscal  year  equals  or  exceeds  an  amount  equal  to  that  income
multiplied by the minimum tax rate.

The qualifying income of a flow-through entity that is an ultimate parent
(2)
entity  shall  also  be  reduced,  for  the  fiscal  year,  by  the  amount  of  qualifying
income  that  is  allocated  to  the  ownership  holder  in  the  flow-through  entity
provided that the ownership holder is

(a)

(b)

a natural person that is tax resident in the jurisdiction where the ultimate
parent entity is located and that holds ownership interests representing
a right to 5 per cent or less of the profits and assets of the ultimate parent
entity; or

a  governmental  entity,  an  international  organisation,  a  non-profit
organisation or a pension fund that is tax resident in the jurisdiction
where the ultimate parent entity is located and that holds ownership
interests representing a right to 5 per cent or less of the profits and
assets of the ultimate parent entity.

The qualifying loss of a flow-through entity that is an ultimate parent entity
(3)
shall  be  reduced,  for  the  fiscal  year,  by  the  amount  of  qualifying  loss  that  is
attributable to the ownership holder.

Subsection (3) shall not apply to the extent the ownership holder is not

(4)
allowed to use such loss for the computation of its taxable income.

Subsections (1) to (4) shall apply to a permanent establishment through
(5)
which  a  flow-through  entity  that  is  an  ultimate  parent  entity  wholly  or  partly
carries out its business or through which the business of a tax transparent entity
is  wholly  or  partly  carried  out,  provided  that  the  ultimate  parent  entity’s
ownership interest in that tax transparent entity is held directly or through one or
more tax transparent entities.

For the purposes of this section, “ownership holder” means the holder of

(6)
an ownership interest in the flow-through entity.

69

Ultimate parent entity subject to a deductible dividend regime

40.(1)
An  ultimate  parent  entity  of  an  MNE  group  that  is  subject  to  a
deductible  dividend  regime  shall  reduce,  up  to  zero,  for  the  fiscal  year,  its
qualifying income by the amount that is distributed as deductible dividend within
12 months after the end of the fiscal year, provided that:

(a)

(b)

the dividend is subject to tax in the hands of the recipient for a taxable
period that ends within 12 months after the end of the fiscal year at a
nominal rate that equals or exceeds the minimum tax rate; or

it can be reasonably expected that the aggregate amount of adjusted
covered  taxes  of  the  ultimate  parent  entity  and  taxes  paid  by  the
recipient on such dividend equals or exceeds that income multiplied
by the minimum tax rate.

An ultimate parent entity of an MNE group that is subject to a deductible
(2)
dividend regime shall also reduce, up to zero, for the fiscal year, its qualifying
income by the amount that it distributes as deductible dividend within 12 months
after the end of the fiscal year, provided that the recipient is:

(a)

(b)

(c)

a  natural  person,  and  the  dividend  received  is  a  patronage  dividend
from a supply cooperative;

a natural person that is tax resident in the same jurisdiction where the
ultimate  parent  entity  is  located  and  that  holds  ownership  interests
representing a right to 5 per cent or less of the profits and assets of the
ultimate parent entity; or

a  governmental  entity,  an  international  organisation,  a  non-profit
organisation or a pension fund other than a pension services entity, that
is a tax resident in the jurisdiction where the ultimate parent entity is
located.

The  covered  taxes  of  an  ultimate  parent  entity,  other  than  the  taxes  for
(3)
which the dividend deduction was allowed, shall be reduced proportionally to

70

the amount of qualifying income reduced in accordance with subsection (1) and
(2).

Where the ultimate parent entity holds an ownership interest in another
(4)
constituent  entity  that  is  subject  to  a  deductible  dividend  regime,  directly  or
through a one or more such constituent entities, subsections (1), (2) and (3) shall
apply to any other constituent entity located in the jurisdiction of the ultimate
parent entity that is subject to the deductible dividend regime, to the extent that
its  qualifying  income  is  further  distributed  by  the  ultimate  parent  entity  to
recipients that meet the requirements set out in subsections (1) and (2).

For the purposes of subsection (1), a patronage dividend distributed by a
(5)
supply cooperative shall be treated as subject to tax in the hands of the recipient
insofar as such dividend reduces a deductible expense or cost in the computation
of the recipient’s taxable income or loss.

(6)

For the purposes of this section,

“deductible dividend” means, with respect to a qualifying entity that is subject

to a deductible dividend regime

(a)

a distribution of profits to the holder of an ownership interest in the
qualifying  entity  that  is  deductible  from  the  taxable  income  of  the
qualifying entity under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is located;
or

(b)

a patronage dividend to a member of a cooperative; and

“deductible dividend regime” means a tax regime that applies a single level of
taxation on the income of the owners of an entity by deducting or excluding
from the income of the entity the profits distributed to the owners or by
exempting a cooperative from taxation;

“cooperative”  means  an  entity  that  collectively  markets  or  acquires  goods  or
services on behalf of its members and that is subject to a tax regime in the
jurisdiction where it is located that ensures the tax neutrality in respect of
goods  or  services  that  are  sold  or  acquired  by  its  members  through  the
cooperative;

71

“patronage dividend” means a distribution by a cooperative to its members.

Determination of the effective tax rate and top-up tax of an investment
entity

41.(1)
Where a qualifying entity of an MNE group is an investment entity
that is not a tax transparent entity and that has not made an election in accordance
with sections 42 and 43, the effective tax rate of such investment entity shall be
computed separately from the effective tax rate of the jurisdiction in which it is
located.

The effective tax rate of the investment entity as referred to in subsection
(2)
(1) shall be equal to its adjusted covered taxes divided by an amount equal to the
allocable  share  of  the  MNE  group  in  the  qualifying  income  or  loss  of  that
investment entity.

Where more than one investment entity is located in a jurisdiction, their
(3)
effective tax rate shall be computed by combining their adjusted covered taxes
as well as the allocable share of the MNE group in their qualifying income or
loss.

The  adjusted  covered  taxes  of  an  investment  entity  as  referred  to  in
(4)
subsections (1) and (2) shall be the adjusted covered taxes that are attributable to
the allocable share of the MNE group in the qualifying income of the investment
entity and the covered taxes allocated to the investment entity in accordance with
section 27.

The  investment  entity’s  adjusted  covered  taxes  shall  not  include  any
(5)
covered taxes accrued by the investment entity attributable to income that is not
part of the MNE group’s allocable share of the investment entity’s income.

The top-up tax of an investment entity as referred to in subsection (1) shall
(6)
be  an  amount  equal  to  the  top-up  tax  percentage  of  the  investment  entity
multiplied by an amount equal to the difference between the allocable share of
the  MNE  group  in  the  qualifying  income  of  the  investment  entity  and  the
substance-based income exclusion computed for the investment entity.

72

(7)
The  top-up  tax  percentage  of  an  investment  entity  shall  be  a  positive
amount equal to the difference between the minimum tax rate and the effective
tax rate of such investment entity.

(8)
The  substance-based  income  exclusion  of  an  investment  entity  shall  be
determined in accordance with section 31(1) to (7), subject to the adjustments in
subsection (9).

The eligible payroll costs of eligible employees and eligible tangible assets
(9)
taken into account for such investment entity shall be reduced in proportion to
the allocable share of the MNE group in the qualifying income of the investment
entity divided by the total qualifying income of such investment entity.

For the purposes of this section, the allocable share of the MNE group in
(10)
the qualifying income or loss of an investment entity for a fiscal year is the ratio
of

(a)

(b)

the qualifying income or loss of the investment entity for the fiscal year
reduced  by  the  amount  of  such  income  attributable  to  ownership
interests held by other owners; to

qualifying income or loss of the investment entity for the fiscal year
taking into account only interests that are not subject to an election in
accordance with sections 42 or 43.

Election to treat an investment entity as a tax transparent entity

42.(1)
At  the  election  of  the  filing  entity,  a  qualifying  entity  that  is  an
investment  entity  or  an  insurance  investment  entity  may  be  treated  as  a  tax
transparent entity if the qualifying entity-owner is subject to tax in the jurisdiction
in which it is located under a fair market value or a similar regime based on the
annual changes in the fair value of its ownership interests in such entity and the
tax  rate  applicable  to  the  qualifying  entity-owner  on  such  income  equals  or
exceeds the minimum tax rate.

At the election of the filing entity, a qualifying entity that is an investment
(2)
entity or an insurance investment entity may be treated as a tax transparent entity

73

if the qualifying entity-owner is subject to tax in the jurisdiction in which it is
located under a fair market value or a similar regime based on the annual changes
in the fair value of its ownership interests in such entity and the tax rate applicable
to the qualifying entity-owner on such income equals or exceeds the minimum
tax rate.

A  qualifying  entity  that  indirectly  owns  an  ownership  interest  in  an
(3)
investment entity or in an insurance investment entity through a direct ownership
interest in another investment entity or an insurance investment entity shall be
considered to be subject to tax under a fair market value or similar regime with
respect to its indirect ownership interest in the first-mentioned investment entity
or insurance investment entity if it is subject to a fair market value or similar
regime  with  respect  to  its  direct  ownership  interest  in  the  second-mentioned
investment entity or insurance investment entity.

The election under subsection (2) shall be made in accordance with section

(4)
44(1).

If the election is revoked, any gain or loss from the disposal of an asset or
(5)
a liability held by the investment entity or an insurance investment entity shall
be determined on the basis of the fair market value of the asset or liability on the
1st day of the year the revocation is made.

Election to apply a taxable distribution method

43.(1)
At the election of the filing entity, a qualifying entity-owner may apply
a  taxable  distribution  method  with  respect  to  its  ownership  interest  in  the
investment entity, provided that the qualifying entity-owner is not an investment
entity and can be reasonably expected to be subject to tax on distributions from
the investment entity at a tax rate that equals or exceeds the minimum tax rate.

Under  the  taxable  distribution  method,  distributions  and  deemed
(2)
distributions of the qualifying income of an investment entity shall be included
in  the  qualifying  income  of  the  qualifying  entity-owner  that  received  the
distribution, provided that it is not an investment entity.

74

(3)
The  amount  of  covered  taxes  incurred  by  the  investment  entity  that  is
creditable against the tax liability of the qualifying entity-owner arising from the
distribution of the investment entity shall be included in the qualifying income
and  adjusted  covered  taxes  of  the  qualifying  entity-owner  that  received  the
distribution.

The share of the qualifying entity-owner in the undistributed net qualifying
(4)
income of the investment entity referred to in subsection (3) arising in the third
year preceding the fiscal year, the ‘tested year’, shall be treated as qualifying
income of that investment entity for the fiscal year.

The amount equal to such qualifying income multiplied by the minimum

(5)
tax rate shall be treated as top-up tax of a qualifying entity for the fiscal year.

The  qualifying  income  or  loss  of  an  investment  entity  and  the  adjusted
(6)
covered taxes attributable to such income for the fiscal year shall be excluded
from the computation of the effective tax rate in accordance with Part V and with
section  41(1)  to  (4),  except  for  the  amount  of  covered  taxes  referred  to  in
subsection (3).

The undistributed net qualifying income of an investment entity for the
(7)
tested year, referred to in subsection (4), shall be the amount of qualifying income
of that investment entity for the tested year reduced, up to zero, by:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

the covered taxes of the investment entity;

distributions  and  deemed  distributions  to  shareholders  that  are  not
investment entities during the period starting with the first day of the
third year preceding the fiscal year and ending with the last day of the
reporting fiscal year in which the ownership interest was held referred
to as the ‘testing period’;

qualifying  losses  arising  during  the  testing  period  referred  to  in
paragraph (b); and

any residual amount of qualifying losses that has not already reduced
the undistributed net qualifying income of that investment entity for a
previous tested year, namely the investment loss carry-forward.

75

(8)
The undistributed net qualifying income of an investment entity shall not
be  reduced  by  distributions  or  deemed  distributions  that  already  reduced  the
undistributed net qualifying income of that investment entity for a previous tested
year in application of the subsection (7)(b).

The undistributed net qualifying income of an investment entity shall not
(9)
be  reduced  by  the  amount  of  qualifying  losses  that  already  reduced  the
undistributed net qualifying income of that investment entity for a previous tested
year in application of the subsection (7)(c).

For the purposes of this section, a deemed distribution shall arise when a
(10)
direct or indirect ownership interest in the investment entity is transferred to an
entity that does not belong to the MNE group and is equal to the share of the
undistributed net qualifying income attributable to such ownership interest on
the date of such transfer, determined without regard to the deemed distribution.

The election under subsection (1) shall be made in accordance with section

(11)
44.

If the election is revoked, the share of the qualifying entity-owner in the
(12)
undistributed net qualifying income of the investment entity for the tested year
at the end of the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year the revocation is made shall
be treated as qualifying income of the investment entity for the fiscal year.

The amount equal to such qualifying income multiplied by the minimum

(13)
tax rate shall be treated as top-up tax of qualifying entity for the fiscal year.

PART IX

TRANSITIONAL RELIEF

Tax treatment of deferred tax assets, deferred tax liabilities and
transferred assets upon transition

When  determining  the  effective  tax  rate  for  a  jurisdiction  in  a
54.(1)
transition year, and for each subsequent fiscal year, the MNE group shall take
into account all the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities reflected or
disclosed in the financial accounts of all the qualifying entities in a jurisdiction
for the transition year.

Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities shall be taken into account

(2)
at the lower of the minimum tax rate and the applicable domestic tax rate.

Notwithstanding subsection (2), a deferred tax asset that has been recorded
(3)
at a tax rate lower than the minimum tax rate may be taken into account at the
minimum tax rate if the taxpayer is able to demonstrate that the deferred tax asset
is attributable to a qualifying loss.

The  impact  of  any  valuation  adjustment  or  accounting  recognition

(4)
adjustment with respect to a deferred tax asset shall be disregarded.

Deferred tax assets arising from items excluded from the computation of
(5)
qualifying income or loss in accordance with Part III shall be excluded from the
computation  referred  to  in  subsection  (2)  when  such  deferred  tax  assets  are
generated in a transaction that takes place after 30th November, 2021.

85

In the case of a transfer of assets between constituent entities after 30th
(6)
November, 2021 and before the commencement of a transition year, the basis in
the  acquired  assets,  other  than  inventory,  shall  be  based  upon  the  disposing
qualifying entity’s carrying value of the transferred assets upon disposal with
deferred tax assets and liabilities determined on that basis.

Transitional relief for filing obligations

55.
Notwithstanding section 45, the notifications referred to in section 45
and the return referred to in section 46 shall be filed with the Commissioner no
later than 3 months after the specified return date of the reporting fiscal year that
is the transition year referred to in section 54.

Exclusion from the top-up-tax of MNE groups in the initial phase of
their international activity

Subject to section 55, the top-up-tax that would otherwise be taken
56.(1)
into account under section 30 shall be reduced to zero during the initial phase of
an MNE group’s international activity, where none of the ownership interest in
the  qualifying  entities  are  held  by  parent  entities  subject  to  an  IIR,
notwithstanding the requirements otherwise provided in Part V.

For the purposes of this section, an MNE group is in its initial phase of its

(2)
international activity if, for a fiscal year

(a)

(b)

it has constituent entities in no more than 6 jurisdictions; and

the  sum  of  the  net  book  values  of  tangible  assets  of  all  constituent
entities located in all jurisdictions other than the referenced jurisdiction
does not exceed €50 000 000.

(3)

For the purposes of subsection (2)

(a)

the referenced jurisdiction of an MNE group is the jurisdiction where
the MNE group has the highest total value of tangible assets for the
fiscal year in which the MNE group originally comes within the scope
of the GloBE Model Rules;

86

(b)

the total value of tangible assets in a jurisdiction is the sum of the net
book values of all tangible assets of all constituent entities of the MNE
group that are located in that jurisdiction.

(4)

For the purposes of subsection (3)

“ net book values of tangible assets” means the average of the beginning and end
values of tangible assets after taking into account accumulated depreciation,
depletion, and impairment, as recorded in the financial statements;

those  tangible  assets  are  included  in  the  separate  financial  accounts  of  that
permanent  establishment  as  determined  by  section  21  and  the  tangible  assets
allocated to the tax jurisdiction of a permanent establishment shall not be taken
into account for the tangible assets of the tax jurisdiction of the main entity.

This section shall not apply for any fiscal year that starts later than 5 years
(6)
after the first day of the first fiscal year when the MNE group originally came
within the scope of the GloBE Model Rules.

PART X

TRANSITIONAL SAFE HARBOUR

Transitional safe harbour election

57.(1)
harbour election for a fiscal year.

The  filing  entity  of  a  DMTT  Group  may  make  a  transitional  safe

(2)
The effect of the election is that all of the qualifying entities of the DMTT
Group  are  to  be  treated  as  not  having  top-up  amounts  for  the  purpose  of

87

determining  the  liability  of  any  qualifying  entities  of  the  DMTT  Group  to
domestic top-up tax.

(3)

An election may only be made for a fiscal year if

(a)

(b)

(c)

the fiscal year commences on or before 31st December, 2026 and ends
on or before 30th June, 2028;

a qualifying country-by-country report has been prepared in relation to
Barbados for the fiscal year;

the election has been made in respect of Barbados for each preceding
fiscal year that commenced on or after 31st December, 2023 in which
any member of the group was a qualifying entity;

(d)

at least one of the following tests are met for Barbados in the fiscal
year:

(i)

the threshold test in section 62;

(ii)

the simplified effective tax rate test in see section 63;

(iii)

the routine profits test in section 64.

An election may not be made if Barbados is the territory of the ultimate
(4)
parent entity of a MNE group for a fiscal year and the ultimate parent entity is a
flow-through entity unless

(a)

(b)

its qualifying income would be nil as a result of the application of the
adjustments for an ultimate parent entity that is a flow-through entity;
or

all  of  its  qualifying  income  would  be  attributable  to  one  or  more
permanent establishments and no amount of income or expense of any
permanent establishment would be treated, as a result of the attribution
of losses between permanent establishment and main entity, as income
or expense of the ultimate parent entity.

88

(5)

An election to which this Part applies

(a)

(b)

(c)

must specify the fiscal year for which it is to have effect;

must be made no later than the date by which the information return or
overseas return notification in respect of that fiscal year is due; and

must be included in an information return submitted to the Authority
in respect of that fiscal year.

The information return in which the election is made must set out which
(6)
of  the  tests  referred  to  in  susbsection  (3)(d)  are  being  relied  on  and  include
evidence of how any that is relied on is met.

For the purposes of this Part, a country-by-country report in relation to a
(7)
territory is "qualifying" if the information relating to the territory is prepared on
the basis of qualified financial statements of the MNE group in accordance with
section 58.

Qualified financial statements and basis of calculations

58.(1)
group means

For the purposes of this Part “qualified financial statements” of a MNE

(a)

(b)

the accounts used to prepare the consolidated financial statement of the
ultimate parent entity; or

financial statements of constituent entities prepared in accordance with
acceptable financial accounting standards.

Where  a  constituent  entity  is  not  included  in  consolidated  financial
(2)
statements of any other constituent entity on a line-by-line basis solely due to
size or materiality grounds, the financial accounts of that member that are used
for preparation of the group’s country-by-country report are to be regarded as
forming part of the qualified financial statements of the MNE group.

89

(3)
For the purposes of establishing whether the tests in sections 62 to 64 are
met in relation to qualifying entities, the basis for that determination is to be the
information derived from qualified financial statements as to

(a)

(b)

(c)

revenue;

profit (loss) before income tax; and

qualifying income tax expense.

Information derived from qualified financial statements as to revenue or

(4)
profit (loss) before income tax must be adjusted

(a)

(b)

as the information was adjusted for the purposes of its inclusion in a
qualifying country-by-country report in relation to Barbados; or

if the information was not included in such a report, as it would have
been adjusted had it been included in such a report.

The information described in subsection (3)(a) to (c) that must be used to
(5)
determine whether the tests in sections 62 to 64 are met in relation to qualifying
entities must be derived from whichever of the following was used to prepare the
qualifying country-by-country report in relation to Barbados

(a)

(b)

qualified financial statements falling within subsection (1)(a), along
with any financial accounts treated as qualified financial statements as
a result of subsection (2); or

qualified financial statements falling within subsection (1)(b), along
with any financial accounts treated as qualified financial statements as
a result of subsection (2).

Where that information in respect of Barbados is not available in qualified

(6)
financial statements of a MNE group, no election may be made.

90

Application in the case of a joint venture group

59.(1)
effect as if

For the purpose of applying Part X to a joint venture group, this has

(a)

(b)

(c)

section 57(3)(b)were omitted;

the reference in section 58(2) to the financial accounts of that member
that are for preparation of the groups’s country-by-country report was
to the financial accounts that would be used if a qualifying country-by
country report had been prepared in respect of the joint venture group;

the  words  “qualified  substance-based  income  exclusion  amount”
referred to in section 64(2) means that the qualified substance-based
income  exclusion  amount  for  Barbados,  for  a  fiscal  year,  is  the
substance-based exclusion determined for Barbados for the period.

The filing entity may make a separate transitional safe harbour election in

(2)
respect of joint venture members of a joint venture group in Barbados.

Qualifying income tax expense

60.
expense adjusted to exclude

In  this  Part,  “qualifying  income  tax  expense”  means  income  tax

(a)

(b)

any amount that does not relate to covered taxes, and

any amount that relates to an uncertain tax position.

Adjustments

61.(1)

Subsection (2) applies where

(a)

qualifying entities other than investment entities have a net unrealised
fair value loss for a fiscal year; and

(b)

that loss exceeds 50 million euros.

91

Where this subsection applies, those losses are to be excluded from the

(2)
aggregate profit (loss) before income tax of those qualifying entities.

(3)
For the purposes of subsection (2), the relevant qualifying entities have a
net unrealised fair value loss for a fiscal year to the extent their losses that arise
from changes in fair value of relevant ownership interests exceed gains arising
from changes in fair value of relevant ownership interests.

An ownership interest in a qualifying entity is relevant unless, at the end
(4)
of the fiscal year, the qualifying entities do not between them have ownership
interests that entitle them to 10 per cent or more of the qualifying entity’s

(a)

(b)

(c)

profits;

capital;

reserves; and

(d)

voting rights.

Amounts of profits and qualifying tax expense allocated to a qualifying
(5)
entity  from  an  investment  entity  as  a  result  of  an  investment  entity  tax
transparency election are to be reflected (to the extent they are not already) in the
qualifying  entity’s  profit  (loss)  before  income  tax  and  qualifying  tax  expense
used for the purposes of applying the tests in sections 62 to 64.

Amounts  that  are  to  be  included  or  otherwise  taken  account  of  in  the
(6)
adjusted profits and covered tax balance of a qualifying entity as a result of a
taxable distribution method election are to be reflected (to the extent they are not
already) in the qualifying entity’s profit (loss) before income tax and qualifying
tax expense used for the purposes of applying the tests in sections 62 to 64.

Threshold test

62.(1)

The threshold test is met in a fiscal year if

(a)

the revenue of the qualifying entities other than investment entities for
the period is less than 10 million euros; and

92

(b)

the aggregate profit (loss) before income tax of those qualifying entities
for that period is less than 1 million euros.

(2)
Where one or more of those qualifying entities are held for sale and the
revenue  of  those  qualifying  entities  is  not  otherwise  included  in  the  amount
determined for the purposes of subsection (1)(a), that revenue is to be so included.

Simplified effective tax rate test

63.(1)
The  simplified  effective  tax  rate  test  is  met  in  a  fiscal  year  if  the
simplified  effective  tax  rate  of  the  qualifying  entities  other  than  investment
entities is

(a)

in the case of a fiscal year beginning before 1 January 2025, at least 15
per cent;

(b)

in the case of a fiscal year beginning in 2025, at least 16 per cent; or

(c)

in the case of a fiscal year beginning on or after 1 January 2026, at least
17 per cent.

The  simplified  effective  tax  rate  of  the  qualifying  entities  other  than
(2)
investment entities in a fiscal year is the amount (expressed as a percentage) given
by dividing

(a)

(b)

the  aggregate  qualifying  income  tax  expense  of  those  qualifying
entities for that period; by

the aggregate profit (loss) before income tax of those qualifying entities
for that period.

Routine profits test

64.(1)

The routine profits test is met in a fiscal year if

(a)

the qualified substance-based income exclusion amount for Barbados
for that period is equal to or greater than the aggregate profit (loss)
before income tax for that period of the qualifying entities other than
investment entities; or

93

(b)

the aggregate profit (loss) before income tax of those qualifying entities
for that period is nil or reflects an overall loss.

(2)
The “qualified substance-based income exclusion amount” for Barbados
for a fiscal year is the substance-based exclusion determined for Barbados for
the  period  ignoring  any  payroll  carve-out  amount  or  tangible  asset  carve-out
amount of any qualifying entities other than investment entities

(a)

(b)

that is not regarded as a constituent entity of the MNE group for the
purposes of the group’s country-by-country report; or

that  is  not  regarded  as  located  in  Barbados  for  the  purposes  of  that
report.
