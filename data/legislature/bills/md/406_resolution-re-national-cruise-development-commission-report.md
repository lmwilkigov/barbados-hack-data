RESOLUTION

WHEREAS the Government of Barbados has recognised that while the
cruise industry has been recording significant growth over the last several
years, outpacing land-based arrivals, cruise lines are reporting declining
consumer interest in Barbados, due to the fact that its product offering, in
general, and onshore tour capacity, in particular, has neither diversified
nor expanded over the last decade.

AND  WHEREAS  the  Government  of  Barbados  established  a  National
Cruise  Development  Commission  on  August  13,  2018  to  provide  for
immediate  implementation,  a  Mission  Critical  Plan  to  address  the
challenges currently facing the cruise sector in Barbados.

AND  WHEREAS  the  Report  of  the  National  Cruise  Development
Commission,  entitled  “A  New  Dawn  for  Cruise  Tourism  in  Barbados”,
analyses  the  cruise  tourism  industry;  examines  current  global  trends  in
cruise  tourism  and  the  Barbados  situation  and  gives  recommendations
needed to overcome the principal challenges confronting cruise tourism
in Barbados.

AND  WHEREAS  the  Report  also  examines  the  key  infrastructure
necessary for the cruise industry to operate at an optimum level including
enhancing  the  Port  experience  for  cruise  passengers,  improving  road
infrastructure and the need to improve the overall  physical environment
which often prevents cruise passengers from visiting tourist attractions or
landmarks.

AND WHEREAS the Report provides key strategic approaches to cruise
development  including  looking  more  closely  at  the  European  market,
exploring mechanisms for growing summer cruise traffic and prioritizing
training.

AND WHEREAS the Report provides recommendations as to how those
public sector  institutions  involved  in  the  cruise industry  can  play  pivotal
roles  as  intermediaries  between  the  policy  makers  and  private  sector
operators, so as to ensure that an appropriate regulatory mechanism is in
place to facilitate the business community.

AND WHEREAS It is intended that the recommendations put forward by
the  Commission  will  contribute  to  a  sustainable  increase  in  the  cruise
industry-related economic benefits for Barbados.

AND  WHEREAS  the  Cabinet  on  May  30,  2019  agreed  that  the  Final
Report  submitted  by  the  National  Cruise  Development  Commission
entitled  “A  New  Dawn  for  Cruise  Tourism  in  Barbados”  be  laid  in
Parliament.

BE IT RESOLVED that the Parliament of Barbados take note of the Final
Report of the National Cruise Development Commission.
