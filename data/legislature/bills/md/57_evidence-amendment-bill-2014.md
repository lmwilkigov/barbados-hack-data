Amendment of section 72 of Cap. 121

2.
Act, is amended

Section 72 of the Evidence Act, in this Act referred to as the principal

(a)

in subsection (2)

(i)

by deleting paragraph (a) and substituting the following:

“(a)

the  confession  or  admission  was  made  in  circumstances
where  it  was  reasonably  practicable  to  make  sound
recordings of the confession or admission, the questioning of
the  person  and  anything  said  by  that  person  during  that
questioning were recorded;”; and

(ii)

by  deleting  subparagraphs  (iv)  and  (v)  of  paragraph  (b)  and
substituting the following:

“(iv)

a sound recording was made of the reading referred to
in subparagraph (ii) and of everything said by or to the
person questioned or charged as a result of compliance
with  subparagraph  (iii);  and  the  requirements  of
subparagraph (ii) were also observed in respect of that
sound recording;

(v)

before the reading referred to in subparagraph (ii) was
commenced,  an  explanation  was  given  to  the  person
questioned of the procedure that would be followed for
the purpose of compliance with subparagraphs (ii), (iii)
and (iv);”;

(b)

by deleting subsection (3)(c) and substituting the following:

5

“(c)

if a written record of the sound recording is prepared, make
a copy of the written record available to the person questioned
or his legal representative within 7 days after the preparation
of the written record;”; and

(c)

by inserting immediately after subsection (6) the following:

“(7)
For  the  purposes  of  this  section,  “in  the  course  of  official
questioning” means questioning that occurs where a person is under
arrest in a place of detention, involving a police officer’s questioning
under caution that is reasonably likely to elicit incriminating responses
beginning with a police officer’s advice of the person’s right under the
Constitution  of  Barbados,  Cap.  1966/1455  and  ending  when  the
questioning is completely finished.”.

Insertion of section 72A into Cap. 121

3.
72 the following:

The principal Act is amended by inserting immediately after section

“Effect of accused’s failure to mention facts when questioned

72A.(1)
Where,  in  the  course  of  official  questioning,  in  any
proceedings against a person for an offence, evidence is given that the
accused

(a)

at any time before he was charged with the offence, on being
questioned under caution by an interviewing officer trying to
discover  whether  or  by  whom  the  offence  had  been
committed, failed to mention any fact relied on in his defence
in those proceedings; or

6

(b)

on being charged with the offence or officially informed that
he might be prosecuted for an offence, failed to mention any
such fact,

being a fact which in the circumstances existing at the time the accused
could reasonably have been expected to mention when so questioned,
charged or informed, as the case may be, subsection (2) applies.

Where a person fails to mention such facts as are referred to in

(2)
subsection (1)

(a)

(b)

the court, in determining whether there is a case to answer;
or

the court or jury, in determining whether the accused is guilty
of the offence charged,

may draw such inferences from the failure as appear proper.

Where the accused was at an authorised place of detention at the
(3)
time of the failure to mention such facts as are referred in subsection
(1), then subsection (2) shall not apply where he had not been allowed
an opportunity to consult an attorney-at-law prior to being questioned,
charged or informed as mentioned in subsection (1).

Subject  to  any  directions  by  the  court,  evidence  tending  to
(4)
establish the failure maybe given before or after evidence tending to
establish the fact which the accused is alleged to have failed to mention.

(5)

This section does not

(a)

prejudice the admissibility in evidence of the silence or other
reaction  of  the  accused  in  the  face  of  anything  said  in  his
presence  relating  to  the  conduct  in  respect  of  which  he  is
charged, in so far as evidence thereof would be admissible
apart from this section; or

7

(b)

preclude the drawing of any inference from any such silence
or  other  reaction  of  the  accused  which  could  properly  be
drawn apart from this section.

(6)
For  the  purposes  of  this  section,  “in  the  course  of  official
questioning” means questioning that occurs where a person is under
arrest in a place of detention, involving a police officer’s questioning
under caution that is reasonably likely to elicit incriminating responses
beginning with a police officer’s advice of the person’s right under the
Constitution  of  Barbados,  Cap.  1966/1455  and  ending  when  the
questioning is completely finished.”.

Repeal and replacement of section 73 of Cap. 121

4.
substituted:

Section  73  of  the  principal  Act  is  deleted  and  the  following  is

“Exclusion of records of oral questioning

73.(1)
Where  an  accused  does  not  want  to  subject  himself  to  a
sound recording, but an oral admission is made by the accused to an
investigating officer in response to a question put or a representation
made by an officer, a document prepared by or on behalf of the officer
is not admissible in criminal proceedings to prove the contents of the
question, representation or response unless the accused has, by signing,
initialling or otherwise marking the document, acknowledged that the
document is a true record of the question, representation or response.

In subsection (1), “document” does not include a sound recording

(2)
or a transcript of a sound recording. ”.

8

Amendment of section 100 of Cap. 121

5.
substituted:

Section  100  of  the  principal  Act  is  deleted  and  the  following  is

“Visual identification excluded unless certain conditions are
met

100.(1)
not admissible unless

Visual identification evidence adduced by the prosecutor is

(a)

either

(i)

an identification parade was held; or

(ii)

a video identification was conducted

which included the accused before the identification was made; or

(b)

it would not have been reasonable to have

(i)

held a identification parade; or

(ii)

conducted a video identification; or

(c)

the accused refused to take part in an identification parade or
a video identification

and the identification was made without the person who made it having
been intentionally influenced to identify the accused.

Without limiting subsection (1), in determining whether it was
(2)
reasonable  to  hold  an  identification  parade  or  to  conduct  a  video
identification, the court shall take into account the following matters:

(a)

(b)

the kind of offence, and the gravity of the offence, concerned;

the importance of the evidence;

9

(c)

the  practicality  of  holding  an  identification  parade  or
conducting the video identification having regard, amongst
other things

(i)

(ii)

to whether the accused failed to cooperate in the conduct
of the parade or video identification, and to the manner
and extent of, and the reason, if any, for, the failure; and

in any case, to whether the identification was made at or
about the time of the commission of the relevant offence;
and

(d)

the  appropriateness  of  holding  an  identification  parade  or
conducting a video identification having regard, among other
things, to the relationship, if any, between the accused and
the other person who made the identification.

It shall be presumed that it would not have been reasonable to
(3)
conduct an identification parade or a video identification if it would
have  been  unfair  to  the  accused  for  such  an  identification  parade  or
video identification to be conducted.

(4)

Where

(a)

(b)

the  accused  refused  to  take  part  in  the  conduct  of  an
identification  parade  or  a  video  identification  unless  an
attorney-at-law  acting  for  the  accused  or  unless  another
person chosen by the accused was present while it was being
held; and

there were, at the time when the identification parade or video
identification was to be held, reasonable grounds to believe
that it was not reasonably practicable for such attorney-at-
law or other person to be present,

it shall be presumed that it would not have been reasonable to have
conducted an identification parade or video identification at that time.

10

(5)
In determining whether it was reasonable to have conducted an
identification parade or a video identification, the court shall not take
into account the availability of pictures that could be used in making
identifications.

(6)

In this section,

“identification parade” means an identification procedure conducted by
a  police  officer  in  which  a  suspect  and  other  persons  who
physically  resemble  that  suspect  are  shown  to  a  person  to
determine whether that suspect can be identified by the person as
having committed an offence;

“picture identification evidence” means identification evidence relating
to an identification made wholly or partly by the person who made
the identification examining pictures or photographs kept for the
use by the a police officer;

“video identification” means an identification procedure conducted by
a police officer in which moving images or still images of a suspect
and other persons who physically resemble that suspect are shown
to a person to determine whether that suspect can be identified by
the person as having committed an offence;

“visual identification evidence” means identification evidence relating
to an identification based wholly or partly on what a person saw,
but does not include picture identification evidence. ”.

Repeal and replacement of section 169 of Cap. 121

6.
substituted:
