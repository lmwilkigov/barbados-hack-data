PART II

DISCRIMINATION

Meaning of discrimination

3.(1)
person where

For the purposes of this Act, a person discriminates against another

(a)

the  person,  on  a  ground  specified  in  subsection  (2),  directly  or
indirectly, whether intentionally or not, makes a distinction, creates an
exclusion  or  shows  a  preference,  the  intent  or  effect  of  which  is  to
subject  the  other  person  to  any  disadvantage,  restriction  or  other
detriment; or

(b)

the person, directly or indirectly, whether intentionally or not, subjects
the other person to any disadvantage, restriction or other detriment in
the following circumstances:

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

a ground specified in subsection (2) applies to the other person;

as a consequence of the ground the other person does not comply,
or is not able to comply, with a particular requirement of the first-
mentioned person;

the nature of the requirement is such that a substantially higher
proportion  of  persons  to  whom  the  ground  does  not  apply
complies, or is able to comply, with the requirement; and

(iv)

the requirement is not reasonable in the circumstances.

(2)

The grounds referred to in subsection (1) are:

(a)

race;

12

(b)

origin;

(c)

political opinion;

(d)

trade union affiliation;

colour;

(3)

For the purposes of this Act,

(a)

where a person acts on several grounds including a ground referred to
in subsection (2), the person acts on the ground referred to in subsection
(2) if the ground is a substantial reason for the person’s action;

13

(b)

(c)

a person shall be taken to have discriminated against another person
even though the person acts on the basis of a mistaken assumption; and

it is not necessary to show that a ground referred to in subsection (2)
applies to the person discriminated against where it is shown that the
ground, whether on a mistaken assumption or not, was thought to apply
to a relative or associate of the person discriminated against and that
fact was a substantial reason for the discrimination.

For  the  avoidance  of  doubt  and  without  prejudice  to  the  generality  of
(4)
subsections (1) and (2)(f), a person discriminates on the ground of creed where
the person

(a)

(b)

directly  or  indirectly,  whether  intentionally  or  not,  subjects  another
person to any disadvantage, restriction or other detriment because of
the other person’s appearance or dress and that appearance or dress is
required by, or symbolic of, the other person’s creed; or

requires  another  person  to  alter  his  appearance  or  dress  and  that
appearance or dress is required by, or symbolic of, the other person’s
creed.

its services;

in the manner in which it provides the person with its services; or

in  any  other  manner  in  which  it  facilitates  the  employment  of  the
person.

Subsection (2) does not require an employment agency to ensure that an

(3)
employer complies with this Act.

Prevention of discrimination in employment

5.

An employer shall not discriminate against an employee

(a)

(b)

(c)

in the terms or conditions of employment that the employer affords the

(a)

(b)

any ground referred to in section 3(2)(f), (g), (h), (l), (m), (n), (o), (p)
and (r) applies in respect of the employee; and

the  failure  to  make  the  adjustment  results  or  would  result  in  the
employee, because of the ground, being treated less favourably than a
person  to  whom  the  ground  does  not  apply  would  be  treated  in
circumstances that are not materially different.

(2)

For the purpose of subsection (1) “adjustment” includes

(a)

(b)

in relation to, or undergo a test for, a medical condition where the result of the
test is necessary to determine whether the person satisfies, or continues to satisfy,
a genuine occupational qualification.

(3)
qualification where it is an inherent requirement of a particular position.

sex shall be taken to be a genuine occupational qualification where

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

possesses;

it is necessary, in order to preserve decency or privacy, for the job to
be performed by a person of a particular sex;

the nature of the undertaking or establishment within which the job is
to be performed requires the job to be held by a person of a particular
sex; or

services  concerning  their  welfare,  health  or  education  and  those
services can most effectively be performed by a person of a particular
sex.
