REMISSION, CONDITIONAL RELEASE AND DISCHARGE

“PART VIII

Calculation of term of sentence

In any sentence of imprisonment the word "month" shall,
51.(1)
unless the contrary is expressed, be construed as meaning a calendar
month.

A prisoner who, but for this subsection, would be discharged on
(2)
a Sunday, Christmas Day or Good Friday, shall be discharged on the
day next preceding.

For the purposes of this Part, a person committed to prison in
(3)
default of payment of a sum adjudged to be paid by a conviction shall
be treated as undergoing a sentence of imprisonment for the term for
which he is committed; and consecutive terms of imprisonment shall
be treated as one term.

Remission

52.(1)
Rules made under section 66 may make provision whereby,
in  such  circumstances  as  may  be  prescribed  by  such  rules,  a  person
serving  a  sentence  of  imprisonment  for  such  a  term  as  may  be  so
prescribed may be granted remission of such part of that sentence as
may be prescribed on the ground of his industry and good conduct, and

7

on  the  discharge  of  a  person  from  prison  in  pursuance  of  any  such
remission his sentence shall expire.

Where it appears to the Minister that a person serving a sentence
(2)
of imprisonment was under the age of 21 years at the commencement
of his sentence he may direct that instead of being granted remission of
his sentence under such rules he shall, at any time on or after the day
on  which  he  could  have  been  discharged  if  the  remission  had  been
granted, be released on a supervision order under this section.

A person released on a supervision order under this section shall,
(3)
until the expiration of his sentence, be under the supervision of such
society or person as may be specified in the order and shall comply with
such other requirements as may be so specified: but the Minister may
at any time modify or cancel any such requirements.

Where  before  the  expiration  of  his  sentence  the  Minister  is
(4)
satisfied  that  a  person  released  on  a  supervision  order  has  failed  to
comply with any requirement for the time being specified in the order,
he may by order recall him to prison; and thereupon that person shall
be liable to be detained in prison until the expiration of his sentence
and, if at large, shall be deemed to be unlawfully at large.

The  Minister  may  release  on  a  supervision  order  a  person
(5)
detained  in  a  prison  under  subsection  (4)  at  any  time  before  the
expiration of his sentence; and subsections (3) and (4) shall apply in the
case of a person released under this subsection as they apply in the case
of a person released under subsection (2).

Where the unexpired part of the sentence of a person released
(6)
under subsection (2) is less than 6 months, subsections (3) to (5) shall
apply to him subject to the following modifications

(a)

the period for which he is under supervision under subsection
(3) and is liable to recall under subsection (4) shall be a period
of 6 months from the date of his release under subsection (2);

8

(b)

if he is recalled under subsection (4) the period for which he
may be detained thereunder shall be whichever is the shorter
of the following, that is to say

(i)

the remainder of the said period of 6 months; or

(ii)

the part of his sentence which was unexpired on the date
of his release under subsection (2), reduced by any time
during which he had been so detained since that date,

and he may be released on a supervision order under subsection (5) at
any time before the expiration of that period.

For the purposes of this section, a person committed to prison in
(7)
default of payment of a sum adjudged to be paid by a conviction shall
be treated as undergoing a sentence of imprisonment for the term for
which he is committed, and consecutive terms of imprisonment shall
be treated as one term.

Eligibility for the grant of a release order

53.(1)
A  prisoner  serving  a  term  of  imprisonment  of  4  years  or
more, who has completed two-thirds of that sentence and has been of
good behaviour, shall be eligible for the grant of a release order.

A prisoner who is serving a term of imprisonment for life shall
(2)
be eligible for grant of a release order where that prisoner has completed
two-thirds  of  that  sentence  and  has  been  of  good  behaviour  except
where that prisoner has been sentenced to life imprisonment without
the  possibility  of  a  grant  of  a  release  order  under  section  2  of
the Offences Against The Persons Act , Cap. 141

The Superintendent shall, at the end of each month or within such
(3)
period  as  the  Release  Board  shall  determine,  submit  to  the  Release
Board, a list of all prisoners who will be eligible for the grant of a release
order.

9

(4)

that a prisoner becomes eligible for the grant of a release order give
written notice of that date to the prisoner.

condition of a prisoner’s health it is undesirable to detain him in prison

be temporary and conditional only, the Minister may, if he thinks fit,
having regard to all the circumstances of the case, by order authorise
the temporary discharge of the prisoner for such period and subject to
such conditions as may be stated in the order.

Where an order of temporary discharge is made in the case of a

which his presence may be required.

conditions stated in the order of temporary discharge and shall return
to prison at the expiration of the period stated in the order or of such
extended period as may be fixed by any subsequent order of the Minister
and a prisoner who fails so to comply or return may be arrested without
warrant and taken back to prison.

Where a prisoner under sentence is discharged in pursuance of
(4)
an order of temporary discharge, the currency of the sentence shall be
suspended from the day on which he is discharged from prison under
the order to the day on which he is received back into prison, so that
the former day shall be reckoned and the latter shall not be reckoned as
part of the sentence.

Nothing  in  this  section  shall  affect  the  duties  of  the  medical
(5)
officer in respect of a prisoner whom the Minister does not think fit to
discharge under this section.

may impose, grant to a prisoner a supervision order where the prisoner
is required to leave the confines of the prison to perform a particular

Superintendant under subsection (1), may be arrested without warrant
and returned to prison.
