OFFENCES AGAINST THE PERSON (AMENDMENT) BILL, 2018

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

The  Offences  Against  the  Person  (Amendment)  Bill,  2018  would  make
provision for the repeal of the mandatory imposition of the penalty of death for
the offence of murder under section 2 of the Offences Against the Person Act,
Cap. 141 and other matters related thereto.

Clause 1:

Clause 2:

Clause 1 of the Bill states that the Act may be cited as the
Offences Against the Person (Amendment) Act, 2018.

Clause 2 of the Bill deletes section 2 of the Offences Against
the Person Act, Cap. 141 and substitutes it with a new section
2. The proposed section 2 provides as follows:

Section 2 of the Bill seeks to abolish the mandatory imposition of the
death  penalty  by  expanding  the  sentencing  options  available  to  the
Court for the offence of murder pursuant to the decision in the case of
Severin and Nervais v The Queen [2018] CCJ 19 (AJ).

The Cabinet has made it clear that the death penalty should be retained
as a punishment for the offence of murder. Accordingly section 2(1)
(a) of the Bill makes provision for retention of the death penalty as a
punishment for the offence of murder.

Section  2(1)(b)  provides  that  a  person  convicted  on  indictment  for
murder may also be liable to a sentence of imprisonment for life. The
language  employed  in  terms  of  making  a  person  convicted  on
indictment  for  murder  liable  to  imprisonment  for  life  should  be
interpreted in accordance with section 22(5) of the Interpretation Act,
Cap 1. This means that the sentence of imprisonment for life is to be
interpreted  as  the  maximum  sentence  of  imprisonment  that  can  be
imposed by a Court on a person convicted of the offence of murder. In
other  words,  the  Court  may,  in  its  discretion,  impose  a  sentence  of

i

Offences Against the Person
(Amendment) Bill, 2018

imprisonment  of  zero  years  to  imprisonment  for  life  but  the  Court
cannot impose a term exceeding a term of imprisonment for life. The
said  wording  allows  a  Court  to  tailor  the  punishment  to  take  into
account the particular characteristics of the crime and the participation
and degree of culpability of the defendant.

Section 2(2) sets out the circumstances in which the Court may impose
the death penalty on a person convicted of the offence of murder.

Section 2(3) takes into consideration the decision in Pratt v. Morgan
[1993] 4 All E.R. 769. Thus, section 2(3) requires that where the Court
sentences a person to death, that sentence must be executed within a
five  year  period  or  risk  being  in  breach  of  section  15  of  the
Constitution  which  seeks  to  protect  a  person  from  being  subject  to
torture  or  to  inhuman  or  degrading  punishment  or  other  treatment.
Where the sentence is not executed before the expiration of the said
time, the sentence must be commuted to a punishment to be determined
by the Court having regard to the guidelines set out in sections 39 and
41 of the Penal System Reform Act, Cap. 139.

Section 2(4) enables the Court to impose a sentence of imprisonment
for life on a person convicted of the offence of murder. The Caribbean
Court of Justice has indicated in the case of August & Alwin Gabb v.
The Queen [2018] CCJ 7 (AJ) that a sentence for imprisonment for life
should not prohibit the possibility for parole. If the provision does so
it is unconstitutional. Considering the aforementioned, the proposed
section 2(3) provides for the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment
for life on a person convicted of the offence of murder with the Court
being empowered to set a minimum period of imprisonment before the
person convicted of the offence of murder can become eligible for the
grant of a release order. Provision has been made in the Prisons Act,
Cap.  168  for  the  establishment  of  an  entity  to  be  known  as  the
“Prisoners  Release  Board”  which  is  given  the  appropriate  judicial
powers to grant release orders.

ii

Offences Against the Person
(Amendment) Bill, 2018

Section 2(5) states that where the Court is determining the minimum
period of imprisonment in relation to the imposition of the sentence of
imprisonment for life, the Court shall take into account the guidelines
set  out  in  sections  39  and  41  of  the  Penal  System  Reform  Act,
Cap. 139.

Bearing  in  mind  that  the  language  in  section  2(1)(b)  expresses  the
maximum sentence of imprisonment that can be imposed on a person
convicted for murder, section 2(6) provides that where the Court, in
sentencing a person convicted of murder, does not impose the sentence
of imprisonment for life, the Court shall impose a term of imprisonment
which takes into account the guidelines set out in sections 39 and 41
of the Penal System Reform Act, Cap. 139.

Section 2(7) provides that the term “release order” should be assigned
the meaning accorded to it by section 2 of the Prisons Act, Cap. 168.

Clause 3:

Clause 3 of the Bill inserts a new section 2A into the Offences
Against the Persons Act, Cap. 141 in order to address the re-
sentencing  of  certain  persons.  The  explanation  of  the
subsections in the new section 2A is set out as follows:

Section  2A  (1)  (a)  seeks  to  address  persons  who  have  already  been
sentenced under the current Offences Against the Persons Act, Cap.
141. The persons who were sentenced already must be re-sentenced
because the original sentences have been deemed to be unconstitutional
by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in Case 12.645: Tyrone
Dacosta Cadagon v. Barbados.

Section 2A (1)(b) seeks to address persons who have been pardoned
by the Governor-General pursuant to section 78 of the Constitution.
The persons who were pardoned must have their punishments reviewed
because  their  sentence  was  commuted  in  response  to  the  fact  that
Barbados did not have discretion to impose a punishment other than

iii

Offences Against the Person
(Amendment) Bill, 2018

the  death  penalty.  The  aforementioned  constitutes  an  abuse  of  the
prerogative of mercy set out in section 78 of the Constitution.

Section 2A (2) makes it clear that in reviewing the sentences of persons
specified in subsection (1) of section 2A, the sentence of death cannot
be imposed.

Section  2A(3)  states  that  the  guidelines  that  should  inform  the  re-
sentencing of persons pursuant to subsection (1) are those guidelines
set  out  in  sections  39  and  41  of  the  Penal  System  Reform  Act,
Cap. 139.
