LAW REVISION AND LAW REFORM BILL, 2018

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

SUMMARY

The  Purpose  of  this  Bill  is  to  repeal  and  replace  the  Law  Revision  Act  to
modernize the system of revising, consolidating and editing the Laws. This is
necessary to make the system compatible with the technological environment in
which the Laws are now being produced and managed. The changes will also
increase flexibility and bring improvements in relation to the speed and efficiency
of the system. The Bill would also facilitate the publication of the Laws on the
Internet or in an electronic format such as a CD.

In addition, the Bill makes provision for the establishment of an official Law
Reform Commission. Such a Commission would make it possible for the Laws
to  be  reviewed  and  reformed  on  a  systematic  basis  for  the  first  time.  The
Commission will be required to prepare a law reform programme on an annual
basis  and  provide  law  reform  reports  of  their  research  findings  and
recommendations for submission to Parliament and for the use of the public.

PART I
PRELIMINARY

Clause 1:

This clause provides for the short title.

Clause 2:

This clause provides definitions for the terms used in the Bill.

PART II
LAW REVISION COMMISSIONER

Clause 3:

The provisions of this clause will bring major administrative
improvements to the system by providing for the appointment
of a public officer who is an experienced legislative drafter to

revise and update the Cumulative Edition on a full-time basis.
This is necessary since consolidation as well as the revision
of the Laws is conducted on a continuous basis rather than a
periodic  basis.  The  Act  therefore  removes  the  conflict  and
resulting  procedural
from
appointing  the  full-time  Law  Revision  Commissioner  on  a
periodic basis. These provisions will also ensure that there is
continuity  and  retention  of  the  institutional  knowledge  and
expertise in this specialized field.

irregularities  which  arose

In  particular,  paragraph

This clause details the duties and responsibilities of the Law
Revision  Commissioner.
(b)
continues  to  provide  for  the  conduct  of  Barbados’  highly
acclaimed continuous system of law revision as distinct from
a periodic system of law revision. It requires a full-time Law
Revision Commissioner to revise and consolidate the Laws
by the use of modern methodologies. These provisions will
facilitate the replacement of the slow manual methods by new
and efficient technological methods which will allow for the
updating of the laws soon after enactment.

This clause makes provision for the Laws to be in electronic
format for the purposes of publication to the Internet or the
production  of  a  CD.  This  will  enable  the  Laws  to  be  more
widely  accessed  by  attorneys-at-law,  the  judiciary  and  the
public, thereby strengthening the rule of law.

This clause specifies the powers which are exercisable by the
LRC for the purposes of maintaining the Cumulative Edition.

This  clause  gives  the  Law  Revision  Commissioner  wide
powers to edit and revise the Laws and also to correct mistakes
and to clarify the Laws where necessary.

significance are to be corrected, the correction must now be
made by order for the purposes of record and transparency.

This clause provides a formal procedure for the correction of
errors in new laws, similar to the correction of errors in the
Cumulative  Edition.  Where  errors  of  significance  are  to  be
corrected, the correction must be done by way of notice for
the purposes of record and transparency.

This clause retains the rule that in revising the law, the Law
Revision Commissioner must not change the substance of the
law.

This  clause  corrects  a  deficiency  in  the  existing  law  by
permitting  a  Bill  to  be  drafted  by  the  Law  Revision
Commissioner where substantive changes are required to the
law. Under the existing law, such errors in the law generally
go unaddressed.

This clause requires the Law Revision Commissioner to notify
the relevant ministry where any fees or fines require updating
due to the passage of time.

This  clause  retains  the  power  of  the  Law  Revision
Commissioner to omit any law or provisions of any law from
the  revised  edition  or  the  Cumulative  Edition  where  they
consider it appropriate. However, the exercise of this power
would be less necessary in the new electronic environment.

Clause 14:

This  clause  makes  it  clear  that  the  laws  omitted  from  the
revised edition or Cumulative Edition still remain in force and
are binding.

been  repealed  and  replaced,  references  to  the  provision
throughout  the  law  must  be  treated  as  references  to  the
corresponding provision.

This clause makes provision for the official archiving of the
Laws as documents of record.

This clause makes new provision on an annual basis for the
official archiving as documents of record of the repealed laws
which are removed from the Cumulative Edition as well as
laws which are consolidated or revised.

This clause requires certain officials to maintain a set of Laws
in a current state for the use of the judiciary, legal practitioners
and the public.

This clause requires the Law Revision Commissioner to notify
the relevant ministry where subsidiary legislation which was
made under an Act which has been repealed is substantially

General  from  time  to  time.  These  reports  may  also  be
published for the benefit of the public.
