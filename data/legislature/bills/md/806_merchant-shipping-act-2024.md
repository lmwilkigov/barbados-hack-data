Certificate of registration

On completion of the registration of a ship, the Principal Registrar
107.
shall grant a certificate of registration that includes the information respecting
the ship specified in the Fourth Schedule.

Custody of certificate

108.(1)
navigation of the ship, and shall not be subject to detention by reason of any title,
lien, charge, or interest had or claimed by any owner, mortgagee or other person
to, on, or in the ship.

Notwithstanding subsection (1), where a person, whether interested in the
(2)
ship or not, refuses on request to deliver the certificate of registration that is in
his possession or control to a person entitled to the custody of it for the purposes
of the lawful navigation of the ship, or to the Principal Registrar, an officer of
customs, or any other person entitled by law to require such delivery, a magistrate,
by warrant, or a court capable of taking cognizance of the matter may summon
the person refusing to deliver it to appear before the court and to be examined
regarding the refusal, and unless it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that
there was reasonable cause for the refusal, that person commits an offence and
is liable on summary conviction to a fine of $15 000.

184

case of a certificate that was mislaid, lost or destroyed, or as near to those as the
circumstances permit.

of each such offence, is liable on summary conviction to a fine of $50 000 and
the ship is subject to forfeiture under this Act.

certificate of registration of a ship is missing or damaged, having been lost, stolen
or destroyed or become defaced or illegible, he may issue to the owner a duplicate

as the original.

Where a duplicate certificate of registration is issued, the original, if then
(2)
available  or  if  subsequently  found  or  recovered,  shall  be  surrendered  without
delay to the Principal Registrar.

185

as to the loss, theft, destruction, defacement or illegibility of a certificate, by the
master of the ship or some other person having knowledge of the facts of the case,
shall notify the Principal Registrar of a missing or damaged certificate

(a)

if the ship is in port at the time its certificate of registration goes missing
or damaged, immediately; or

(b)

in any other case, when the ship first arrives in Barbados afterwards.

On being notified of a missing or damaged certificate and being satisfied
(4)
that  the  ship  is  entitled  to  be  issued  with  a  duplicate  certificate,  the  Principal
Registrar shall send to the proper officer, by electronic transmission, a copy of
the duplicate certificate, which the proper officer shall endorse with a statement
of the circumstances under which it is granted.

Where  there  are  no  facsimile  or  other  electronic  transmission  facilities
(5)
available to the Principal Registrar, he shall advise the proper officer, who shall
issue a temporary certificate so endorsed.

A  facsimile  or  other  electronically  transmitted  version  of  the  duplicate
(6)
certificate, or the temporary certificate, as the case may be, shall be surrendered
to the Principal Registrar as soon as an original duplicate certificate referred to
in subsection (1) is received by the owner.

Any person who fails, without reasonable cause to surrender a certificate
(7)
of registration when required to do so under subsection (2) commits an offence
and is liable on summary conviction to a fine of $15 000.

(2)
endorsement,  deliver  the  certificate  of  registration  to  the  Principal  Registrar
without delay.

186

A master who fails to deliver to the Principal Registrar the certificate of
registration  as  required  by  this  section  commits  an  offence  and  is  liable  on
summary conviction to a fine of $15 000.

registration in the model prescribed in the Fifth Schedule, and shall forward a
copy  of  the  certificate  at  the  first  convenient  opportunity  to  the  Principal
Registrar.

No provisional certificate shall be granted under this section unless the

proper officer is satisfied that an application for registry of the ship has been made
or is intended.

A provisional certificate shall have the effect of a certificate of registration

(3)
until the earlier of

(a)

the expiration of 6 months from its date or, where it has been extended,
12 months from that date; and

(b)

the transferor in the presence of, and be attested by, a witness.

Declaration of transfer

Where a registered ship, or a share in one, is transferred in accordance
246.
with section 245(1), the transferee shall not be entitled to be registered as the
owner of it until the transferee, or in the case of a body corporate, the person
authorized by this Act to make declarations on behalf of the body corporate, has
made and signed a declaration in relation to the ship containing

(a)

(b)

a statement of the qualification of the transferee to own a Barbados
ship  or,  if  the  transferee  is  a  body  corporate,  a  statement  that  the
constitution  and  business  of  the  corporation  qualify  it  to  own  a
Barbados ship; and

a declaration that, to the best of his knowledge and belief, a majority
interest in the ship is owned by persons qualified to be the owners of
Barbados ships, and that the ship is otherwise entitled to be registered.

Registration of transfer

247.(1)
Every duly executed bill of sale for the transfer of a registered ship,
or  of  a  share  in  one,  shall  be  produced  to  the  Principal  Registrar  with  the
declaration of transfer.

Upon  being  satisfied  that  the  ship  remains  entitled  to  be  registered  in
(2)
Barbados,  the  Principal  Registrar  shall  enter  in  the  register  the  name  of  the

276

transferee as owner of the ship or share, and shall endorse on the bill of sale the
fact of that entry having been made with the date and time of it.

Bills of sale of a ship, or of shares in one, shall be entered in the register

(3)
in the order of their production to the Principal Registrar.

Upon  the  transfer  being  registered  under  subsection  (2),  the  Principal

(4)
Registrar shall issue a new certificate of registration.

Transmission of property in ship on death, bankruptcy, or marriage

Where the property in a registered ship, or a share in one, is transmitted
248.(1)
to  a  person  by  a  lawful  means  other  than  a  transfer  under  section  245  and  a
majority interest remains in the ownership of a person qualified to be an owner
of a Barbados ship,

(a)

(b)

(c)

that person shall authenticate the transmission by making, signing and
providing to the Principal Registrar a declaration identifying the ship
and containing the statements required to be contained in a declaration
of transfer, with such modifications as the circumstances require, and
provide  a  statement  of  the  manner  in  which  the  property  has  been
transmitted;

where the transmission is consequent on bankruptcy, the declaration
of transmission shall be accompanied by such evidence as is acceptable
by the court adjudicating the bankruptcy as proof of the title of persons
claiming under a bankruptcy;

where the transmission is consequent on the death of the owner, the
declaration  of  transmission  shall  be  accompanied  by  the  death
certificate or an official extract from it; and

(d)

where the transmission was consequent upon an order or judgment of
a court, a copy of the order or judgment.

The Principal Registrar, on receipt of the declaration of transmission and
(2)
any accompanying documents, and upon being satisfied that the ship remains
entitled to be registered in Barbados, shall enter in the register the name of the

277

person entitled under the transmission as owner of the ship or share the property
in which has been transmitted.

Where  more  than  one  person  is  entitled  to  be  registered  under  the
(3)
transmission, the Principal Registrar shall enter the names of all those persons in
the register, but those persons shall, for the purposes of this Act relating to the
number  of  persons  entitled  to  be  registered  as  owners,  be  considered  as  one
person.

Order for sale on transmission to unqualified person

Where the property in a registered ship, or a share in one, is transmitted
249.(1)
to a person by a lawful means other than a transfer referred to in section 246, but
as a result of the transmission the ship no longer remains in the ownership of
persons qualified to be owners of a Barbados ship, then the court seized of the
matter may, on an application by or on behalf of that person, order a sale of the
transmitted  property  and  direct  that  the  proceeds  of  sale,  after  deducting  the
expenses of the sale, shall be paid to that person or otherwise as the court directs.

The court may require any evidence in support of the application that it
(2)
considers  necessary,  and  may  make  the  order  on  any  terms  and  conditions  it
considers just, or may refuse to make the order, and generally may act in the case
as justice requires.

An application for sale shall be made within 4 weeks after the occurrence
(3)
of the event in relation to which the transmission has taken place, or within such
further time, not exceeding in one year from the date of the occurrence, as the
court allows.

Where  such  an  application  is  not  made  within  the  time  prescribed  in
(4)
subsection  (3),  or  if  the  Court  refuses  an  order  for  sale,  the  ship  or  share
transmitted shall be subject to forfeiture under this Act.

Transfer of ship or sale by court order

250.(1)
Where a court, whether under this Act or otherwise, orders the sale of
a ship or share in one, the order of the court shall contain a declaration vesting

278

in a person named by the court the right to transfer the ship or share, and that
person shall then be entitled to transfer the ship or share in the same manner and
to the same extent as if he were the registered owner of it.

The  Principal  Registrar  shall  deal  with  an  application  relating  to  the
(2)
transfer of the ship or share made by the person named under subsection (1) as
if that person were the registered owner.

Power of court

251.(1)
the court, on the application of an interested person, with or without costs,

A court may, without prejudice to the exercise of any other power of

(a)

make an order prohibiting, for a time specified, any dealing with a ship
or a share in one, on any terms or conditions it thinks just;

(b)

refuse to make the order; or

(c)

discharge the order when made.

The Principal Registrar shall, on being served with the order or an official
(2)
copy of it, obey the order, irrespective of whether he was made a party to the
proceedings.

Mortgages and maritime liens: mortgage of ship or share

252.(1)

In this section,

“mortgage” includes any security for the repayment of a loan or other valuable

consideration or the discharge of any other obligation; and

“ship” includes a ship under construction.

A registered ship, or a share in such a ship, may be made a security for a

(2)
mortgage.

A mortgage on a registered ship, or a share in such a ship, shall be in the

(3)
form prescribed.

279

Where a mortgage executed in prescribed form is submitted to the Principal

(4)
Registrar, he shall register the mortgage in the prescribed manner.

(5)

To be valid, a mortgage shall comply with the following formalities:

(a)

(b)

(c)

the mortgage shall be endorsed upon the ship’s documents;

the mortgage shall be registered under subsection (4); and

an affidavit shall be filed with the record of mortgage to the effect that
the mortgage is made in good faith and without any design to hinder,
delay, or defraud any existing or future creditor of the mortgagor or
any person holding a lien of the mortgaged ship.

There shall be endorsed upon the certificate of registration of a ship subject

(6)
to a valid mortgage

(a)

(b)

(c)

the names of the mortgagor and the mortgagee;

the date and time that the endorsement is made; and

the amount and date of maturity of the mortgage.

Mortgages shall be registered in the order in which they are submitted for
(7)
registration to the Principal Registrar and he shall enter and sign on each mortgage
a statement to the effect that it has been registered by him, together with the date
and time of the registration.

Where a mortgage instrument states that it is prohibited to create further
(8)
mortgages over the ship without the prior written consent of the mortgagee, the
Principal Registrar shall make a note of that in the register, and shall not register
any  further  mortgage  unless  the  consent  in  writing  of  the  holder  of  a  prior
mortgage is produced to him.

A mortgage registered other than in accordance with subsection (8) is null

(9)
and void.

Where  a  mortgage  instrument  states  that  it  is  prohibited  to  transfer  the
(10)
ownership of the ship or terminate the registration of the ship, without the prior
written consent of the mortgagee, the Principal Registrar shall make a note of

280

that in the register, and shall not record a transfer of ownership of the ship or
terminate the ship’s registration, unless the appropriate consent in writing of the
holder of the mortgage is submitted to him.

A transfer of ownership or a termination of the ship’s registration registered

(11)
other than in accordance with subsection (10) is null and void.

A mortgage may be registered in the register in respect of a provisionally
(12)
registered ship, and a mortgage so registered is subject to the provisions of this
Act relating to mortgages and any registration regulations made under this Act.

A  mortgage  registered  under  subsection  (12)  shall  continue  to  be  a
(13)
registered mortgage until it is discharged, even if the provisional registration of
the ship in respect of which the mortgage was registered ceases to be effective.

A mortgage in respect of a ship under construction shall be entered in the

(14)
register.

Where the registration of a ship under construction is transferred to another
(15)
part of the register, the entries relating to any mortgage that is not discharged
shall in like manner be transferred to that part of the register.

A mortgage in respect of a ship under construction shall, for the purpose
(16)
of determining priority under this or any other law and in all other respects, be
treated as a registered ship mortgage until it is discharged, even if the ship under
construction ceases to be registered under this Act, and a ship under construction
shall, for the purposes of a mortgage on it under this Act or any other law, be
treated as maritime property.

Notwithstanding subsections (2) to (6), where a ship has been previously
(17)
registered in a foreign country and mortgages were registered against that ship
and at the time of its registration as a Barbadian ship, the applicant for registration
shall produce to the Principal Registrar the written consent of every mortgagee.

On production of the required consents, those mortgages shall be recorded
(18)
by the Principal Registrar in the order of precedence indicated in the previous
register.

281

(19)
No mortgage instrument shall be recorded in the register in respect of a
bareboat chartered ship that has been registered under the law of a foreign country
and that has an existing registration as a Barbadian ship.

Priority of mortgage

Where 2 or more mortgages are registered in respect of the same ship
253.(1)
or  share,  the  priority  of  the  mortgagees  between  themselves  shall,  subject  to
subsection  (2),  be  determined  by  the  order  in  which  the  mortgages  were
registered.

The Minister may make regulations to permit intending mortgagees to give
(2)
priority notices to the Principal Registrar in a form prescribed by the regulations
that will, when recorded in the register, determine the priority of the mortgage
interest to which the notice relates.

Entry of discharge of mortgage

Where  a  registered  mortgage  is  discharged,  the  Principal  Registrar
254.(1)
shall, on the production of the mortgage deed, with a receipt for the mortgage
money endorsed on it, duly signed and attested, make an entry in the register to
the effect that the mortgage has been discharged.

On the entry under subsection (1) being made, any estate that passed to the
(2)
mortgagee shall vest in the person in whom it would have vested if the mortgage
had not been made.

Where for good reason the registered mortgage cannot be produced to the
(3)
Principal  Registrar,  he  may,  on  being  satisfied  that  the  mortgage  has  been
properly discharged, record in the register that the mortgage has been discharged.

Protection of undischarged mortgage

Where  the  registration  of  a  ship  terminates  under  this  Act,  the
255.(1)
termination shall not affect any entry in the register of an undischarged registered
mortgage of the ship or of any share in.

282

(2)
Subsection (1) shall not apply to an entry in the register where the Principal
Registrar is satisfied that a person appearing on the register to be interested as a
mortgagee under the mortgage in question has consented to the entry ceasing to
have effect.

Mortgagee not owner and mortgagee’s power of sale

Except as far as may be necessary for making a mortgaged ship or
256.(1)
share available as a security for the mortgage debt, the mortgagee shall not by
reason of the mortgage be deemed to be the owner of the ship or share, nor shall
the mortgagor be deemed to have ceased to be owner of it.

Subject to subsection (3), every registered mortgagee may, if the mortgage
(2)
money or any part of it is due, sell the ship or share in respect of which he is
registered and give receipts for the purchase money.

Where 2 or more mortgagees are registered in respect of the same ship or
(3)
share,  a  subsequent  mortgagee  shall  not,  except  under  an  order  of  a  court  of
competent jurisdiction, sell the ship or share without the concurrence of every
prior mortgagee.

Mortgage not affected by bankruptcy

257.
A registered mortgage of a ship or share shall not be affected by any
act of bankruptcy committed by the mortgagor after the date of the registration
of the mortgage, notwithstanding that the mortgagor at the commencement of the
bankruptcy had the ship or share in his possession, order or disposition, or was
the reputed owner of it, and the mortgage shall be preferred to any right, claim,
or interest in the ship or share of the other creditors of the bankrupt or of any
trustee or assignee on their behalf.

Transfer of mortgages and transmission of mortgage interest

258.(1)
A registered mortgage of a ship or share may be transferred to any
person and on production of the instrument effecting the transfer the Principal
Registrar shall record it by entering in the register the name of the transferee as

283

mortgagee of the ship or share, and shall enter and sign on the instrument of
transfer a statement to the effect that it has been registered by him, stating the
date and the time of the registration.

Where a mortgage interest in a ship or share is transmitted to any person
(2)
by a lawful means other than by a transfer under subsection (1), that person shall
produce to the Principal Registrar a statement of the manner in which and the
person to whom, the property has been transmitted, accompanied by the same
evidence this Act requires for a transmission of the ownership of a ship or share.

The Principal Registrar, on the receipt of the documents and the production
(3)
of the evidence referred to in subsection (2), shall enter the name of the person
entitled under the transmission in the register as mortgagee of the ship or share.

Lien of registered mortgage

A  mortgage  validly  registered  under  this  Act  shall  constitute  a
259.(1)
maritime  lien  upon  the  vessel  in  the  amount  of  the  outstanding  mortgage
indebtedness secured by the vessel.

A mortgagor, before executing a registered mortgage, shall disclose to the
(2)
mortgagee in writing the existence of every maritime lien, prior mortgage or other
obligation  or  liability  upon  the  vessel  to  be  mortgaged  that  is  known  to  the
mortgagor.

After the execution of the mortgage and before the mortgagee has had a
(3)
reasonable time in which to record it and have proper endorsements made upon
the documents of the vessel, the mortgagor shall not, without the consent of the
mortgagee, incur any contractual obligation creating a maritime lien upon the
vessel other than liens denominated in Article 4 of the International Convention
on Maritime Liens and Mortgages, 1993.

A preferred mortgage may bear the rate of interest that the parties to the

(4)
mortgage mutually agree.

284

Record of notice of claim of lien, discharge of lien and mortgage

260.(1)
The  Principal  Registrar  shall,  at  the  request  of  any  person,  record
notice of the person’s claim of a mortgage or lien upon a vessel registered under
this Act, together with the nature, date of creation and amount of the mortgage
or lien and the name and address of the person.

A person who has caused notice of such a claim to be recorded shall, upon
(2)
a discharge in whole or in part of the indebtedness, without delay file a certificate
of discharge with the Principal Registrar, who shall then record the certificate of
the discharge of the mortgage or lien.

The mortgagor shall, upon the discharge of any mortgage indebtedness in
(3)
part or in full, without delay file a certificate of the discharge duly executed by
the mortgagee, his successor or assigns with the Principal Registrar, who shall
then record the certificate.

The Principal Registrar shall endorse the fact of such a discharge on the
(4)
certificate of registration of the vessel and a certificate of the endorsement, giving
the time, place and description of the endorsement, shall also be recorded in the
register.

Where an endorsement on a certificate of registration is made by a person
(5)
other than the Principal Registrar, the certificate shall be promptly furnished to
the Principal Registrar for recording purposes.

Jurisdiction and procedure on mortgages

261.(1)
Notwithstanding section 260, a lien in respect of a mortgage may be
enforced in Barbados by a suit in rem in the High Court upon default of any of
its terms or conditions and, in addition to any notice by publication, the applicant
shall give notice of the commencement of suit, in such a manner as the High
Court may direct, to the master, other ranking officer or caretaker of the vessel
and to any person who has recorded a notice of claim of an undischarged lien
upon the vessel.

285

(2)
Subsection (1) does not apply where, in spite of a bona fide attempt made
by the applicant to the satisfaction of the High Court, the person could not be
traced within Barbados.

(3)
Subject to section 251, the lien of a mortgage may also be enforced by a
suit in rem or otherwise in any foreign country in which the vessel may be found,
in  accordance  with  the  procedure  of  that  country  for  the  enforcement  of  ship
mortgages constituting maritime liens on vessels documented under the laws of
that country.

Notwithstanding anything in this Act, a mortgagee may, in addition to any
(4)
other remedies granted under this section, bring a suit in personam against the
mortgagor in a court of competent jurisdiction for the amount of the outstanding
mortgage indebtedness or for any deficiency in the full payment of it.

Nothing  in  this  Act  is  deemed  to  authorize  the  enforcement  by  suit  in
(5)
rem  in  the  High  Court  of  the  rights  of  the  mortgagee  in  respect  of  assets  or
personal property other than vessels covered by a mortgage.

Consequences of sale by the court

262.
The sale of a vessel may be made by the order of a competent court
in  accordance  with  the  mortgage  deed  under  Article  12  of  the  International
Convention on Maritime Liens and Mortgages, 1993.

Maritime lien and waiver

263.(1)
A person who provides repairs, towage, supplies or other necessaries,
or permits the use of dry dock, to a vessel, whether domestic or foreign, shall, at
the  request  of  the  owner  or  of  any  person  authorized  by  the  owner,  have  a
maritime lien on the vessel from the time of the transaction for the amounts due
in that respect.

Marine  liens  created  pursuant  to  this  section  shall  be  governed  by  the

(2)
international conventions referred to in section 264.

286

(3)
Nothing in this section is deemed to confer a lien in favour of a person
referred to in subsection (1) if the person knew, or with the exercise of reasonable
diligence could have ascertained, that the person who requisitioned the services,
supplies or other necessaries was acting without authority.

A person who is entitled to a lien under subsection (1) may, at any time by
(4)
agreement or otherwise, waive his right to the lien or, in the case of preferred
mortgage, to the preferred status of the lien.

International Convention on Maritime Liens and Mortgages, 1993

Article  16  of  the  International  Convention  on  Maritime  Liens  and
264.(1)
Mortgages, 1993 shall have the force of law in Barbados, but without prejudice
to any transaction enacted prior to the date of coming into force of this Act to
which Article 1-11 of the Brussels Convention 1926 applied.

Notwithstanding  Article  6  of  the  International  Convention  on  Maritime
(2)
Liens and Mortgages 1993, a maritime lien is valid for a period of 12 months
from the time when the claim secured by it arose.

PART XIV

PREFERRED SHIP MORTGAGES AND MARITIME LIENS

Application

265.
This  Part  applies  to  mortgages  that  are  the  first  lien  that  may  be
claimed against a vessel and that take precedence over all other liens on the vessel,
other  than  liens  specified  under  Article  4  of  the  International  Convention  on
Maritime Liens and Mortgages 1993.

Meaning of preferred mortgage

266.
a vessel registered in Barbados that meets the requirements of section 269.

In this Part, “preferred mortgage” means a mortgage recorded against

287

Recording and contents

267.(1)
A  sale,  conveyance,  hypothecation,  mortgage  or  assignment  of
mortgage of a vessel, against a person other than the grantor or mortgagor, his
heirs  or  devises  and  persons  having  actual  notice  of  it  is  not  valid  until  the
instrument evidencing the transaction is recorded under this section.

The Principal Registrar shall record an instrument referred to in subsection
(2)
(1),  in  the  order  of  its  receipt,  in  the  indices  to  be  kept  for  that  purpose,
showing

(a)

(b)

(c)

the name of the vessel;

the names of the parties;

the time and date of receipt of the instrument;

(d)

the interest of the vessel transferred or affected; and

(e)

the  amount  of  the  direct  or  contingent  obligations,  including  those
provided for in section 275, that are or may become secured by the
mortgage.

Registration, recording and discharge of financing charters

268.(1)
Without  adversely  affecting  the  documentation,  eligibility  for
documentation or renewal of documentation of a vessel, a documented owner
and a charterer who has executed a contract in the form of a demise or bareboat
charter of a documented vessel may register for recording a copy of the contract
with the Principal Registrar in the name of the documented owner.

The contract shall be signed and acknowledged by the documented owner

(2)
and the charterer and shall include

(a)

(b)

(c)

the name and official number of the vessel;

the date of the contract;

the names and addresses of the documented owner and the charterer;

288

(d)

the total amount secured; and

(e)

the  maximum  aggregate  of  the  nominal  amount  of  all  charter  hire
payments, termination payments, and purchase or put option amounts
that  could  under  any  circumstances  be  due  and  payable  under  the
financing  charter,  excluding  any  interest,  indemnities,  expenses  or
fees.

A security interest in a vessel in favour of a documented owner, evidenced
(3)
by  a  contract  that  is  a  financing  charter,  that  is  registered  for  recording  in
compliance with this section, is deemed to be a preferred mortgage on the vessel
in favour of the documented owner for all purposes, effective as of the date and
time of filing.

This  Part  shall  apply  to  any  contract  registered  in  accordance  with  this

(4)
section that is a financing charter.

A  documented  owner  may  also  register  for  recording,  any  renewals,
(5)
amendments, supplements, assignments or other instruments related to a contract
registered under subsection (1).

A  documented  owner  may  grant  one  or  more  preferred  mortgages
(6)
encumbering  the  whole  of  a  vessel,  and  any  supplements,  amendments,
assignments  or  other  instruments  related  to  them,  notwithstanding  that  the
documented owner or predecessor in interest has entered into a contract that is
deemed to be a preferred mortgage on the vessel pursuant to subsection (1).

The mere registration or recording of a contract as a financing charter under
(7)
this section shall not constitute evidence that the contract is, in fact, a financing
charter or that it creates a security interest.

The  documented  owner  party  to  a  financing  charter  is  deemed  to  be  a
(8)
mortgagee under a preferred mortgage and the finance charterer is deemed the
mortgagor, for all purposes under the laws of Barbados.

Without  affecting  the  validity  of  a  financing  charter  as  a  preferred
(9)
mortgage, the parties to a financing charter may redact or omit any exhibit to it,
including any schedule with respect to the due date and amount of individual

289

instalments  of  charter  hire  and  the  timing  and  amount  of  individual  purchase
options, termination payments or puts.

An existing demise or bareboat charter that does not meet the requirements
(10)
of this section may be eligible for filing as a financing charter upon execution
and acknowledgment of an amendment or supplement that specifically attaches
and incorporates the existing demise or bareboat charter, if the amendment or
supplement meets the recording requirements of this section.

The Principal Registrar may accept for filing a discharge of a preferred
(11)
mortgage maritime lien that is evidenced by a recorded financing charter under
this section, if the filing will not affect the registration of the vessel or otherwise
affect any rights or obligations of the parties under the financing charter.

Preferred mortgage

A valid mortgage that at the time it is made includes the whole of a
269.(1)
vessel,  including  a  vessel  under  construction,  shall  have  a  preferred  status  in
respect of the vessel as of the date of its recording under this Act.

The preferred status of a mortgage under this Part shall not be prejudiced

(2)
or impaired by reason

(a)

that the mortgage secures the payment, pledge or assignment of monies
or  rights,  due  or  to  become  due,  such  as  guarantee  fees,  insurance
options,  charter  hire,  freight  revenues  or  any  other  fees,  costs  or
charges,  direct  or  contingent,  incidental  to  the  sale,  purchase  or
operation of a Barbados vessel;

(b)

of the applicability of or compliance with section 275; or

(c)

that  no  advance  of  monies  is  or  has  been  made  at  the  time  of  its
recording.

(3)

Notwithstanding subsection (1), a valid mortgage, whenever made, that

(a)

(b)

includes the whole of any vessel;

is recorded as provided in this Part; and

290

(c)

is granted in continuation of a prior recorded mortgage, hypothecation
or  similar  charge  on  the  vessel,  whether  granted  under  the  laws  of
Barbados  or  the  laws  of  another  nation  under  which  the  vessel  was
documented at the time the prior mortgage was recorded,

shall have preferred status in respect of the vessel as of the date of recording of
the prior mortgage, hypothecation or similar charge.

For purposes of this section, a mortgage that is granted in continuation of
(4)
a prior recorded mortgage, hypothecation or similar charge is deemed a mortgage
on a Barbados vessel if

(a)

(b)

(c)

the vessel covered by the mortgage is covered by the prior mortgage,
hypothecation or similar charge;

the obligations secured by the mortgage are obligations secured by the
prior mortgage, hypothecation or similar charge;

the mortgage is granted by the current vessel owner, whether or not the
owner  is  the  vessel  owner  who  granted  the  prior  mortgage,
hypothecation or similar charge to secure obligations secured by the
prior mortgage, hypothecation or similar charge; and

(d)

for  a  vessel  entering  the  Barbados  international  ships  registry,  the
mortgage is recorded during the period defined in subsection (6).

Nothing  in  subsection  (4)  shall  be  construed  to  pre-empt  any  court
(5)
judgment that would recognize the preferred status of a mortgage on a vessel of
Barbados prior to the date of its recording.

For  a  vessel  entering  the  Barbados  international  ships  registry,  the
(6)
preferred  status  of  a  mortgage,  hypothecation  or  similar  charge  on  the  vessel
recognized under section 284 shall continue for a period of 30 days following
registration of the vessel, if the information with respect to the mortgage required
by the Principal Registrar is furnished to the Principal Registrar in connection
with the registration of the vessel under this Act.

291

(7)
The preferred status of a mortgage shall not be adversely affected by the
deletion or release of the mortgage as a matter of record from the vessel’s prior
register in connection with, or as a condition to, deletion of the vessel from that
register.

A certified extract of the preferred mortgage index of the public register
(8)
maintained  by  the  Principal  Registrar,  a  certificate  of  ownership  and
encumbrance  issued  by  the  Principal  Registrar  or,  in  the  case  of  a  mortgage,
hypothecation  or  similar  charge  recorded
in  another  nation,  similar
documentation,  including  a  transcript  of  registry,  certified  or  issued  by  the
appropriate governmental agency in that nation, shall be accepted as evidence of
the  granting  and  recording  of  a  mortgage,  hypothecation  or  similar  charge,
including the date of its recording.

Termination of mortgagee’s interest

The interest of a mortgagee in a vessel registered under this Act shall
270.(1)
not  be  terminated  by  a  forfeiture  of  the  vessel  for  a  violation  of  any  law  of
Barbados, unless the mortgagee authorized, consented or conspired to effect the
act, failure, or omission that constituted the violation.

Subject to subsection (3), a vessel that is the subject of a preferred mortgage
(2)
may not be cancelled from the register for so long as the indebtedness secured
by the preferred mortgage remains unsatisfied or the mortgage is not otherwise
discharged.

The Principal Registrar may, not less than 60 days following the mailing
(3)
of notice to all mortgagees of record at their last known mailing addresses of his
intent to do so, strike a vessel from the registry and flag of Barbados as a result
of receipt by the Principal Registrar of evidence satisfactory to him that the vessel
has been lost, destroyed or transferred to another registry following sale by order
of an admiralty court in a civil action in rem.

The striking of a vessel under subsection (3) shall not impair or affect the
(4)
lien or status of any preferred mortgage recorded under this Part or terminate the
interest of a mortgagee in the vessel.

states the interest of the mortgagor in the vessel, and the interest mortgaged.

A mortgage in relation to a vessel shall not be recordable unless it

(2)
A mortgage or instrument of release or discharge of a mortgage shall not

the original has been received by a notary public or a special agent that
recites the interest of the seller in the vessel and the interests sold or
conveyed;

it has previously been acknowledged or is submitted with such other
proof of due execution required by the laws of Barbados; and

if it is a bill of sale of a vessel already documented under the laws of
Barbados,  it  has  attached  to  it  a  copy  of  its  latest  certificate  of
registration.

Recording of mortgage

vessel if

(a)

(b)

The  Principal  Registrar  may  accept  for  recording  a  mortgage  on  a

it recites the interest of the mortgagor in the vessel and the interest
mortgaged;

it  is  notarized,  bears  an  apostille,  has  been  acknowledged  or  is
submitted with such other proof of due execution required by the laws
of Barbados; and

293

(c)

written proof is furnished to the Principal Registrar of the amounts and
dates of any documents or evidence of debts in support of it.

(2)
The  Principal  Registrar  shall  record  a  mortgage  or  related  instrument
submitted in proper form, and shall, upon request, issue a certified extract of the
preferred  mortgage  index  of  the  public  register  maintained  by  the  Principal
Registrar as evidence of recording of a preferred ship mortgage under this Part.

A certificate of ownership and encumbrance shall, upon request, be issued
(3)
by the Principal Registrar, setting forth all recorded mortgages, encumbrances
and related instruments with respect to a vessel registered under this Act as at the
time and date of its issuance.

Allocation of mortgage indebtedness

If  a  preferred  mortgage  includes  more  than  one  vessel  or  includes
274.(1)
property that is not a vessel, the mortgage may provide for the separate discharge
of each vessel and of all property not a vessel by the payment of a part of the
mortgage indebtedness.

If a vessel that is covered by a preferred mortgage includes more than one
(2)
vessel, or property that is not a vessel, is to be sold on the order of an admiralty
court in a civil action in rem and the mortgage does not provide for a separate
discharge as provided in subsection (2), the preferred mortgage shall constitute
a lien on that vessel in the full amount of the outstanding mortgage indebtedness,
and  an  allocation  of  mortgage  indebtedness  for  the  purpose  of  a  separate
discharge may not be made by that court among the vessel and other property
covered by the mortgage.

Advances and repayments pursuant to commitment

A  preferred  mortgage  may  secure  future  advances,  including
275.(1)
contingent obligations, and shall not be extinguished or lose its priority because
all  previously  outstanding  obligations  secured  by  it  have  been  fully  repaid  or
otherwise performed, if an advance or other value is to be given at a later time
pursuant to commitment existing at the time the mortgage is recorded.

294

(2)
For  the  purpose  of  subsection  (1),  an  advance  or  other  value  is  given
pursuant to commitment if the mortgagee or other person entitled to the benefit
of the security of the mortgage has bound himself to give it, whether or not a
subsequent event of default or other event not within his control has relieved, or
may relieve, him from that obligation.

When a preferred mortgage secures an obligation in respect of which one
(3)
or more advances or repayments may be made from time to time in the future
and the maximum amount outstanding under the obligation at any one time is
limited  to  a  certain  amount,  the  amount  to  be  recorded  with  respect  to  that
obligation may be either

(a)

(b)

the maximum amount that may be outstanding at any one time; or

the aggregate of all possible advances that may be made.

A preferred mortgage made pursuant to commitment shall clearly indicate
(4)
whether the amount is the maximum amount that may be outstanding at any one
time or is the aggregate of all possible advances.

Advances or other value given pursuant to agreement

276.(1)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Part, a preferred mortgage
may  secure  an  agreed-upon  maximum  amount  representing  all  debts  or
obligations arising or that may arise between the debtor and the creditor within
a specified period.

Such a maximum amount may exceed the value of the vessel or vessels,
(2)
which may themselves represent only a part of all of the assets that are subject
to the preferred mortgage.

Only indebtedness that incurred on or prior to the maturity date or date of
(3)
termination of a preferred mortgage made pursuant to agreement shall retain its
status  and  ranking  as  a  preferred  maritime  lien  under  this  Part,  and  that
indebtedness  shall  include  all  expenses  and  interest  associated  with  the
indebtedness prior to maturity.

295

(4)
A preferred mortgage made pursuant to agreement under this section shall
not be required to represent a commitment to lend on the part of the mortgagee,
but shall secure all debts or obligations arising or that may arise between the
parties as a result of transactions the nature of which are subject to the provisions
of the mortgage deed, whether present or future, actual or contingent, and shall
set forth in addition to other terms and conditions the maximum amount and the
maturity  date,  or  a  statement  of  the  date  of  termination  if  it  is  other  than  the
maturity date.

Nothing  contained  in  this  section  shall  be  construed  to  impair  the  lien
(5)
status, recordability, validity or enforceability with respect to a vessel registered
under this Part of a preferred mortgage granted by its owner that

(a)

(b)

secures  obligations,  in  whole  or  in  part,  arising  out  of  specific
successive business contracts or other transactions, whether or not such
contracts or transactions are related to or arise from the construction,
purchase, sale or chartering of a vessel registered under this Part; or

secures all debts or obligations owed or to be owed under it, so long as
the aggregate amount of such debts or obligations does not exceed at
any one time the stated maximum amount of the mortgage.

The  preferred  status  of  a  mortgage  made  pursuant  to  agreement  in
(6)
accordance with this section that may be secured by property that is not a vessel
or more than one vessel shall not be impaired by reason that the mortgage does
not provide for a separate discharge of it.

Units of account

277.(1)
The obligations secured by a preferred mortgage may be expressed in
any unit or units of account to which the parties may agree, including the currency
of Barbados and the currency of a foreign state, or in equivalents of any other
unit or units of account established by intergovernmental organizations.

If a preferred mortgage secures an obligation in one or more specified units
(2)
of account and there is an option to have a unit of account altered from time to

296

time, the principal amount of the mortgage to be recorded shall be denominated
in one or more of the specified units of account.

A recording referred to in subsection (2) may include as additional words
(3)
“or an equivalent amount in any alternate unit of account” or similar language,
and if such additional words are recorded, no change in the recorded amount shall
be required to reflect the fact that the obligation or any portion of it is subsequently
denominated in a different unit of account, unless the parties otherwise agree.

When a preferred mortgage secures an obligation in respect of which there
(4)
is an option to have the obligation amount denominated from time to time in
alternate units of account but which continues to be payable in, or by reference
to, a specified unit of account

(a)

(b)

the amount of the obligation to be recorded shall be expressed in the
specified unit of account; and

notwithstanding any exercise of the option, no change in the recorded
amount shall be required.

A preferred mortgage described in subsections (2) or (4) may additionally
(5)
secure  a  loss  up  to  a  specified  amount  arising  out  of  fluctuations  between  a
specified unit of account and any alternate unit of account in which the obligation
amount may be denominated from time to time, and that specified amount shall
also be recorded.

Lien of preferred mortgage

278.(1)
A  preferred  mortgage  shall  constitute  a  maritime  lien  upon  the
mortgaged  vessel  in  the  amount  of  the  outstanding  mortgage  indebtedness
secured by the vessel.

The  lien  of  a  preferred  mortgage  shall  not  be  in  any  way  impaired  or
(2)
affected because the vessel’s document following recording of the mortgage has
expired, or has been restrictively endorsed, suspended, revoked or cancelled.

297

Interest on preferred mortgage

Notwithstanding  any  other  law  or  regulation  to  the  contrary,  a
279.
preferred mortgage may secure an interest, including interest in an interest, on
an obligation secured by the mortgage as the parties may agree, including at a
fixed rate, variable rate, rate based upon a formula, or by adding margins to the
mortgagee’s  cost,  from  time  to  time,  of  funding  an  obligation  secured  by  the
mortgage.

Priority, disclosure of liens and penalty

A mortgagor, before executing a preferred mortgage, shall disclose to
280.(1)
the mortgagee in writing the existence of any maritime lien, prior mortgage or
other obligation or liability upon the vessel to be mortgaged that is known as the
mortgagor.

After  the  execution  of  a  mortgage  and  before  the  mortgagee  has  had  a
(2)
reasonable time in which to record it, the mortgagor shall not incur without the
consent  of  the  mortgagee  any  contractual  obligation  creating  a  lien  upon  the
vessel, other than a lien specified under Article 4 of the Convention on Maritime
Liens and Mortgages 1993.

A mortgagor, or the president or principal officer of a corporate mortgagor,
(3)
who contravenes this section with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud an existing
or future creditor of the mortgagor or of a lien on the mortgaged vessel commits
an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine of $75 000.

On  the  conviction  for  an  offence  under  subsection  (3),  the  mortgage
(4)
indebtedness shall become immediately due and payable at the election of the
mortgagee.

Exhibition of certified copies

281.(1)
Upon the recording of a preferred mortgage, 2 certified copies of it
shall be delivered to the mortgagor, who shall place and use due diligence to
retain  one  copy  on  board  the  mortgaged  vessel,  and  cause  the  copy  and  the

298

document of the vessel to be exhibited by the master of the vessel to any person
having business that may give rise to a maritime lien or to the sale, conveyance
or mortgage of the vessel.

The license of a Master who wilfully fails to exhibit a document and copy

(2)
referred to in subsection (1) may be suspended or revoked.

Discharge of mortgage

282.(1)
A  mortgagor,  upon  the  complete  discharge  of  the  mortgage
indebtedness, shall without delay file a certificate of the discharge, duly executed
by the mortgagee, or his successors or assigns, with the Principal Registrar, who
shall record the certificate.

A mortgagor may similarly file a certificate of partial discharge, which

(2)
shall be similarly recorded.

Jurisdiction and procedure on foreclosure and default

The lien of a preferred mortgage may be enforced in Barbados by a
283.(1)
suit in rem in the High Court of Barbados, sitting in Admiralty, upon default of
any term or condition of the mortgage.

In  addition  to  any  notice  by  publication,  actual  notice  of  the
(2)
commencement of such a suit shall be given by the libellant, in such manner as
the Court directs, to the master, other ranking officer or caretaker of the vessel,
and to any person who has recorded a notice of claim of an undischarged lien
upon the vessel, unless after search by the libellant satisfactory to the Court no
such person is found within Barbados.

Failure  to  give  notice  under  subsection  (2)  shall  not  constitute  a
(3)
jurisdictional defect, but the libellant is liable to a person who has recorded a
notice of claim of an undischarged lien upon the vessel for damages in the amount
of any interest in the vessel terminated by the suit.

The lien of a preferred mortgage may also be enforced by a suit in rem in
(4)
admiralty  or  otherwise  in  any  foreign  country  in  which  the  vessel  is  found,

299

pursuant to the procedure of that country for the enforcement of ship mortgages
constituting maritime liens on vessels documented under the laws of that country.

Notwithstanding anything in this Part, a mortgagee may, in addition to any
(5)
other  remedy  under  this  Part,  bring  suit  in  personam  against  the  mortgagor,
maker,  co-maker  or  guarantor  in  any  court  of  competent  jurisdiction  for  the
amount of the outstanding mortgage indebtedness or for any deficiency in the
full payment of it.

The enforcement by a suit in rem in admiralty of the rights of a mortgagee
(6)
with respect to a vessel covered by a preferred mortgage shall not be precluded
or impaired, notwithstanding the enforcement of any rights that the mortgagee
may have under the mortgage to property that is not a vessel.

Preferred status

284.(1)

In sections 261, 266, 268 and 270

“preferred mortgage” means

(a)

(b)

a preferred mortgage made under this Part;

a mortgage, hypothecation or similar charge created as security upon
a documented foreign vessel, if the mortgage, hypothecation or similar
charge was duly and validly executed and registered in accordance with
the laws of the nation where the vessel’s ownership is documented; or

(c)

a  financing  charter  of  a  foreign  vessel  that  has  been  registered  in  a
public registry at the port of registry of the vessel or at

(i)

(ii)

the  central  office  in  the  foreign  country  under  whose  laws  the
ownership of the vessel is registered in the name of the person
stated to be the owner of the financing charter; and

if applicable, the central office in the foreign country under whose
bareboat charter registry laws the financing charter of the vessel
is registered in order to permit the vessel to sail under the flag of
that foreign country; and

300

“preferred mortgage lien” includes a lien of such a mortgage, hypothecation or

similar charge.

In sections 251 and 252, “preferred mortgage” includes a financing charter
(2)
of  a  foreign  vessel  that  has  been  registered  in  a  public  registry  at  the  port  of
registry of the vessel or at

(a)

(b)

the  central  office  in  the  foreign  country  under  whose  laws  the
ownership of the vessel is registered in the name of the person stated
to be the owner of the financing charter; and

if  applicable,  the  central  office  in  the  foreign  country  under  whose
bareboat  charter  registry  laws  the  financing  charter  of  the  vessel  is
registered in order to permit the vessel to sail under the flag of that
foreign country.

Priority of preferred mortgage lien on foreclosure

Subject to subsection (2), upon the sale of any vessel in a suit in rem
285.(1)
in the High Court of Barbados, sitting in Admiralty, for the enforcement of a
preferred  mortgage  lien,  all  pre-existing  claims  in  the  vessel,  including  any
possessory common law liens, shall terminate and attach in like amount and in
accordance with their respective priorities to the proceeds of sale.

In the circumstances referred to in subsection (1), a preferred mortgage
(2)
lien shall have priority over all claims against the vessel, except maritime liens
specified under Article 4 of the International Convention on Maritime Liens and
Mortgages 1993 and costs taxed by the Court.

Enforcement of lien for necessaries

286.(1)

or marine railway or other necessaries to a foreign or domestic vessel upon the
order of the owner or person authorized by the owner shall have a maritime lien

(2)
The  managing  owner,  ship’s  agent,  master,  or  any  person  to  whom  the
management of the vessel at the port of supply is entrusted, including any person
appointed by a charterer, owner pro hac vice or agreed purchaser in possession,
is presumed to have authority from the owner to procure such necessaries.

Subsection  (2)  does  not  apply  to  a  person  tortiously  or  unlawfully  in

(3)
possession or charge of the vessel.

Subsection  (1)  does  not  apply  if  the  furnisher  knew,  or  by  exercise  of
(4)
reasonable diligence could have ascertained that, because of the terms of a charter
party, agreement for sale of the vessel or for any other reason, the person ordering
necessaries was without authority to bind the vessel for them.

Waiver of lien for necessaries

This Part shall not prevent the furnisher of repairs, supplies, towage,
287.
use of a dry dock or marine railway or other necessaries, or a mortgagee, from
waiving the right to a lien or, in the case of a preferred mortgage lien, the right
to the preferred status of such a lien, by agreement or otherwise.

registered  under  this  Act,  a  bill  of  sale  issued  in  connection  with  the  sale  or
transfer shall be recorded by the Principal Registrar as soon as practicable after
the sale or transfer.

The  tonnage  of  any  ship  to  be  registered  under  Part  VII  shall  be

Wherever  the  tonnage  of  a  ship  has  been  ascertained  and  registered  in
(2)
accordance with the regulations, the same tonnage shall be used every subsequent
registration of the ship unless

(a)

(b)

an alteration is made in the form or capacity of the ship; or

it  is  discovered  that  the  tonnage  of  the  ship  has  been  erroneously
computed,

304

in which case the tonnage shall be re-measured, determined and registered in
accordance with the regulations.

Tonnage of ships of foreign countries adopting tonnage regulations

296.(1)
The Director may order that ships of a foreign country that has adopted
the  International  Convention  on  Tonnage  Measurement  of  Ships,  1969  shall,
without  being  re-measured  in  Barbados,  be  treated  as  being  of  the  tonnage
denoted by their certificates of registry or other national papers to the same extent,
and for the same purposes, as the tonnage denoted in the certificate of registration
of a Barbados ship.

(2)

Any such order may

(a)

(b)

operate for a limited time; and

be subject to such conditions and qualifications as the Director may
consider expedient.

Where  it  appears  to  the  Director  that  the  tonnage  of  a  foreign  ship,  as
(3)
measured by the rules of the country to which the ship belongs, materially differs
from what it would be under the regulations, he may order that any ships of that
country  shall,  for  all  or  any  of  the  purposes  of  this  Act,  be  re-measured  in
accordance with the regulations.

PART XX

COLLISION PREVENTION AND NAVIGATIONAL SAFETY

Collision regulations

Barbados  ships  in  any  waters  and  foreign  ships  when  in  Barbados
352.(1)
waters shall comply with the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions
at Sea, 1972, as incorporated into the regulations.

The provisions of this Part apply mutatis mutandis to vessels of 150 GT
(2)
and  below  registered  under  the  Shipping  (Domestic  Vessels)  Act,  2024
(Act 2024-22).

Barbados ships to observe collision regulations

353.(1)
signals other than those prescribed by the regulations.

A Barbados ship shall not carry or exhibit any lights or use any fog

The International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972, as
(2)
amended,  apply  to  the  owners  and  pilots  of  seaplanes  registered  in  Barbados
while on the surface of the water in the same manner as it applies to the owners
and masters of ships.

The master or owner of a ship or owner or pilot of a seaplane who wilfully
(3)
contravenes  the  regulations  commits  an  offence  and  is  liable  on  summary
conviction to a fine of $50 000 or 6 months imprisonment.

Foreign ships in Barbados waters

354.
The regulations made under this Act shall be observed by all foreign
ships and foreign seaplanes within Barbados waters, and in any case before a
court  in  Barbados  concerning  a  breach  of  those  regulations  occurring  within
Barbados waters, foreign ships and foreign seaplanes shall be treated as if they
were Barbados ships and seaplanes registered in Barbados.

346

Collision liability

355.(1)
Liability  for  collision  damage,  including  damage  to  vessels,  their
cargoes, and the property of the crew, passengers or other persons on board, or
of third parties, shall be apportioned according to the degree of fault of each ship
involved in a collision.

Where it is not possible to determine the degree of fault of each vessel, or

(2)
if it appears that the faults are equal, liability shall be apportioned equally.

There shall be no presumption of fault against a ship for a contravention

(3)
of the regulations without proof of fault or negligence.

Where a collision between ships is caused by some act beyond the control
(4)
of the master or operator, or if the cause is in doubt, the damages shall be borne
by those who have suffered them, notwithstanding that either vessel may have
been at anchor, or was otherwise made fast, at the time of the collision.

Where the collision is caused entirely by the fault of one of the vessels,
(5)
liability to make good the damages shall attach to the vessel that committed the
fault.

In respect of damages in relation to death or personal injuries, the vessels
(6)
in fault shall be jointly and severally liable to third parties, without prejudice to
the right of the vessel that has paid a larger part than that which, in accordance
with subsections (1) and (2), she ought ultimately to bear, to obtain a contribution
from the other vessel or vessels at fault.

A vessel is liable for a collision where the collision was caused by the fault

(7)
of a pilot, whether or not the pilot is required to be carried by law.

The right of action for the recovery of damages resulting from a collision
(8)
is not conditional upon the entering of a protest or the fulfilment of any other
formality.

Where  no  collision  has  taken  place,  liability  for  damage  to  the  vessels
(9)
involved in the incident, or to goods or persons on board the vessels resulting

347

from the execution or non-execution of a manoeuvre or a contravention of the
regulations shall be determined in accordance with this section.

Inspection to enforce compliance with regulations

356.(1)
A surveyor or inspector may inspect a ship of any nationality in a port
of  Barbados  to  determine  whether  the  ship  is  properly  provided  with  lights,
shapes and the means of making sound signals as required by the regulations.

If a surveyor or inspector finds that the ship is not so provided, he shall
(2)
specify in writing the action required to rectify the deficiency and shall detain
the ship until the deficiency is rectified to his satisfaction.

Duty to render assistance following collision

In the event of a collision between ships, the master of each ship shall,
357.(1)
so far as he can do so without damage to his own ship, crew and any passengers,

(a)

(b)

render to the other ship and its master, crew and any passengers such
assistance as may be practicable and necessary to save them from any
danger  from  the  collision,  and  stand  by  the  other  ship  until  he  has
ascertained that the ship has no need for further assistance; and

give the master of the other ship the name and port of registry of his
ship and the names of the ports from which his ship sailed and to which
his ship is bound.

Subsection (1) applies to the masters of Barbados ships and to the masters

(2)
of foreign ships when in Barbados waters.

The failure of the master of a ship to comply with this section shall not
(3)
raise any presumption of law that the collision was caused by his wrongful act,
neglect or default.

348

Offences

The master of a ship who fails without reasonable cause to comply
358.
with section 357 commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction of $150
000 or to imprisonment for a term of 6 months or to both.

Master to notify hazards to navigation

The  master  of  a  Barbados  ship,  upon  encountering  a  danger  to
359.(1)
navigation specified in subsection (2), shall send information by any means at
his disposal to the appropriate shore-based authorities and such information shall
be repeated by the master and shore-based authorities to ships in the vicinity, as
practicable.

(2)

The dangers to navigation referred to in subsection (1) are

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

dangerous ice;

a dangerous derelict;

a hurricane, typhoon, cyclone or other storm of a similar nature;

air  temperature  below  the  freezing  point  associated  with  gale  force
winds causing severe ice accretion on the superstructure of ships;

winds of force 10 or above on the Beaufort scale for which no storm
warning has been received; or

(f)

any other direct danger to navigation.

A master of a ship is deemed to have encountered a storm referred to in
(3)
paragraph  (2)(c)  if  he  has  reason  to  believe  that  there  is  such  a  storm  in  the
vicinity.

A master who fails to comply with this section commits an offence and is
(4)
liable  on  summary  conviction  to  a  fine  of  $20  000  or  to  imprisonment  for  6
months.

349

It shall be a defence for any person charged under this section to show that

(5)
he took all reasonable precautions to avoid the commission of the offence.

Master to proceed moderately in danger sea

360.(1)
When ice is reported on or near the course of a Barbados ship, the

Where a certificate issued under section 418 that is in force is produced

(a)

(b)

the  ship  is  deemed  to  have  been  surveyed  in  accordance  with  the
regulations made under section 441; and

if lines are marked on the ship corresponding in number and description
to the deck-line and load lines as required by those regulations, and the
positions of those lines so marked correspond to the positions of the
deck-line and load lines specified in the certificate, the ship is deemed
to be marked as required by those regulations.

Convention ship of not less than 24m in length.

The  Director  may,  at  the  request  of  the  government  of  a  Convention
(2)
country, issue in respect of a ship referred to in subsection (1) a certificate in a

388

form prescribed by regulations made under section 408, if the Director is satisfied
that he could properly issue a certificate in respect of the ship under section 428(1)
if the ship were a Barbados ship.

Regulations made under section 408 shall ensure that certificates that are
(3)
issued as International Load Line Certificates in respect of ships to which this

(4)

In this section, “appropriate load line” means,

(a)

in relation to a ship in respect of which a valid Convention certificate
is produced and in any circumstances for which a particular load line
is specified in the certificate, the load line that, in accordance with the
certificate,  indicates  the  maximum  depth  to  which  the  ship  may  be
loaded in salt water in those circumstances; and

390

(b)

in relation to a ship in respect of which a valid Convention certificate
is  not  produced  and  in  any  circumstances  prescribed  by  regulations
made under section 441, the load line that, in accordance with those
regulations, indicates the maximum depth to which the ship may be
loaded in salt water in those circumstances; and “load line”, in relation
to a ship in respect of which a valid Convention certificate is produced,
means a line marked on the ship in the position of a load line specified
in that certificate.

Barbados load line certificates

owner of the ship, a Barbados load line certificate shall be issued to him by the
Director or by a person authorized for the purpose by the Director.

Subject  to  subsection  (3),  sections  419  and  420  apply  in  relation  to  a

(3)
section 424 applies is valid only so long as the ship is not plying on international
voyages, and shall be cancelled by the Director if he has reason to believe that
the ship is plying on international voyages.

Production of certificate to customs and excise officer

428.(1)
Subject to any exemption conferred under this Part, before a foreign
registered ship proceeds to sea from a port in Barbados, the master of the ship
shall produce the appropriate certificate to the officer of customs from whom a
clearance for the ship is demanded, and a clearance shall not be granted, and the
ship may be detained, until the appropriate certificate is produced.

391

(2)

For the purposes of this section an appropriate certificate

(a)

in the case of a ship to which section 424 applies,

(i)

(ii)

where  a  clearance  for  the  ship  is  demanded  in  respect  of  an
international voyage, is a valid Convention certificate; and

where a clearance for the ship is demanded in respect of any other
voyage, is either a valid Convention certificate or a Barbados load
line certificate in force in respect of the ship; and

(b)

in any other case, is a Barbados load line certificate in force in respect
of the ship.

Inspection

429.(1)
registered ship while the ship is within a port in Barbados.

Subject to subsections (2) to (5), a surveyor may inspect any foreign

A surveyor may go on board a ship to which section 424 applies, while the
(2)
ship is within a port in Barbados, for the purpose of demanding production of an
International Load Line Certificate or Barbados load line certificate in force in
respect of the ship.

Where a valid Convention certificate is produced to the surveyor in respect
(3)
of the ship, the powers of the surveyor under subsection (1) shall be limited to
ensuring

(a)

(b)

(c)

that the ship is not loaded beyond the limits allowed by the certificate;

that  lines  are  marked  on  the  ship  in  the  positions  of  the  load  lines
specified in the certificate;

that  no  material  alterations  have  taken  place  in  the  hull  or
superstructures of the ship that affect the position in which any of those
lines ought to be marked; and

(d)

that the fittings and appliances for the protection of openings, the guard
rails, the free ports and the means of access to the crew’s quarters have

392

been maintained on the ship in as effective a condition as they were in
when the certificate was issued.

Where on an inspection of a ship under this section the ship is found to
(4)
have been so materially altered in respect of the matters referred to in paragraphs
(3)(c) or (d) that the ship is manifestly unfit to proceed to sea without danger to
human life, it shall be deemed to be unsafe for the purposes of Part XXIV.

Where a ship is detained in the circumstances referred to in subsection (4),
(5)
the Director shall order the ship to be released as soon as he is satisfied that the
ship is fit to proceed to sea without danger to human life.

Power to make exemptions

430.(1)
conditions of international voyages

Where  in  the  opinion  of  the  Director  the  sheltered  nature  and

(a)

(b)

between  near  neighbouring  ports  in  Barbados  and  those  in  another
Convention country; or

between near neighbouring ports in any two or more countries outside
Barbados; make it unreasonable or impracticable to apply this Part to
ships  plying  on  such  voyages,  and  the  Director  is  satisfied  that  the
government of the other country or of each of the other countries, as
the case may be, concurs in that opinion, the Director may by an order
direct that ships plying on international voyages between those ports,
or any class of such ships specified in the order, shall be exempt from
the requirements of this Part.

The Director may by order direct that a ship engaged solely in the coasting
(2)
trade, or any class of such ships specified in the order, shall be exempt from this
Part while not carrying cargo or shall be exempt from this Part whether carrying
cargo or not.

An order under this section may be made subject to such conditions as the
(3)
Director thinks fit and, where any such order is made subject to conditions, the

393

exemption conferred by that order shall not have effect in relation to a ship unless
the ship complies with those conditions.

Further powers to exempt ships

431.(1)
exempt a ship

In the circumstances set out in subsections (2) to (5), the Director may

from those provisions specified in the instrument.

On  the  application  of  the  owner  of  a  Barbados  ship  that  is  a  pre-1966
(2)
Convention ship of not less than 150 GT or a post-1966 Convention ship of not
less than 24m in length, the Director may exempt the ship if in his opinion the
ship embodies features of a novel kind such that, if the ship had to comply with
all the requirements of this Part and of the regulations made under section 441,
the development of those features and their incorporation in ships engaged on
international voyages might be seriously impeded.

(3)

On the application of the owner of a Barbados ship that is

(a)

a  pre-1966  Convention  ship  of  less  than  150  GT  or  a  post-1966
Convention ship of less than 24m in length; or

(b)

any other ship that does not ply on international voyages,

the Director may exempt the ship.

Where a Barbados ship that is a pre-1966 Convention ship of not less than
(4)
150 GT or a post-1966 Convention ship of not less than 24m in length, does not
normally  ply  on  international  voyages  but  is  required  to  undertake  a  single
international voyage, the Director, on the application of the owner of the ship
specifying the international voyage, may exempt the ship while engaged on that
voyage.

Any exemption conferred under this section may be conferred subject to

(5)
such conditions as the Director thinks fit.

394

Issuance of exemption certificates

432.(1)

made under section 441; and

any extension of the period for which the certificate was issued, as may
be prescribed by the regulations.

434.
Convention,  are  issued  in  respect  of  ships  to  which  section  423  applies  by

prescribed by regulations made under section 441, have the same effect for the
purposes of this Part as if they were valid Convention certificates.

Subdivision load lines deck and cargo

435.(1)

Barbados passenger ship is marked with subdivision load lines, and the lowest
of those lines is lower than the line that would be the appropriate load line for

395

the purposes of section 416, that section shall have effect as if that subdivision
load line were the appropriate load line for the purposes of that section.

Where in accordance with regulations made under section 441 a foreign-
(2)
registered passenger ship is marked with subdivision load lines, and the lowest
of those load lines is lower than the line that would be the appropriate load line

(b)

in the case of a Barbados ship; or

in the case of any other ship while the ship is within a port in Barbados,

the master of the ship commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction
to a fine of $15 000.

Where a person is charged with an offence under subsection (5), it shall be
(2)
a defence to prove that the contravention was due solely to a deviation or delay
that was caused solely by stress of weather or other circumstances that the master,
the owner or the charterer, if any, could not have prevented or forestalled.

For the purpose of securing compliance with the regulations respecting
(3)
deck cargo, a person authorized for the purpose by the Director may inspect any
ship to which this Part applies that is carrying cargo in an uncovered space on its
deck.

which the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea applies and to
cargo ships of less than 500 GT.

The  provisions  of  this  Part  respecting  carriage  of  dangerous  goods  in
(2)
packaged  form  or  in  solid  form  in  bulk  do  not  apply  to  ships’  stores  and
equipment, including ships’ distress signals.

This Part and any regulations made under section 446 respecting dangerous
(3)
goods  apply  to  all  Barbados  ships  and  to  all  foreign  ships  while  loading  or
discharging cargo or fuel, or embarking or disembarking passengers, at any place
in Barbados in the same manner as they apply to Barbados ships.

398

Definition

In this Part, “grain” includes wheat, maize, corn, oats, rye, barely, rice
443.
pulses, seeds and processed forms of them whose behaviour is similar to that of
grain in its natural state.

Carriage of grain

Where grain is loaded on board a Barbados ship, or is loaded within
444.(1)
a port in Barbados on board any ship, all necessary and reasonable precautions
shall be taken to prevent the grain from shifting.

For the purpose of ensuring compliance with this section, a surveyor may
(2)
go on board a Barbados ship, or a foreign ship that is in a port of Barbados, and
inspect any grain loaded in the ship and the manner in which it is stowed.

(3)

If the precautions referred to in subsection (1) are not taken,

(a)

the owner or the master of the ship, or any agent of the owner who was
charged with the loading or with sending the ship to sea laden with the
grain, commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a
fine of $15 000; and

(b)

the ship is deemed for the purposes of Part XXII to be unsafe by reason
of improper loading.

Where a ship that was loaded with grain outside Barbados without taking
(4)
all necessary and reasonable precautions to prevent the grain from shifting enters
a port in Barbados so laden,

(a)

(b)

the owner and master of the ship each commit an offence and are liable
on summary conviction to a fine of $25 000; and

the ship is deemed for the purposes of Part XXII to be unsafe by reason
of improper loading.

399

(5)
No offence is committed under subsection (4) where the ship would not
have entered the port but for stress of weather or any other circumstance that the
master, owner or charterer, if any, could not have prevented or forestalled.

448.(1)
or parcel that he suspects might contain dangerous goods and may require such
a package to be opened to ascertain its nature.

When dangerous goods, or any goods that, in the opinion of the master or
(2)
owner of the ship, are dangerous goods, have been sent on board a ship without
the marking or written notice required under section 446, the master or owner of
the ship may cause the goods, together with any package or container in which
they are carried, to be thrown overboard.

PART XXIV

UNSAFE SHIPS

Unsafe ship

For  the  purpose  of  sections  453  to  456,  a  ship  is  unsafe  if,  having
452.(1)
regard to the nature of the service for which she is intended, the ship is unfit to
go to sea without serious danger to human life by reason of

(a)

the condition, or the unsuitability for its purpose, of

(i)

the ship or her machinery or equipment; or

(ii)

any part of the ship or its machinery or equipment;

(b)

undermanning;

(c)

overloading or unsafe or improper loading; or

(d)

any other matter relevant to the safety of the ship.

For the purposes of sections 453 to 456, a ship at sea is unsafe if, having
(2)
regard to the nature of the service for which she is being used or is intended, the
ship is, by reason of the matters referred to in paragraphs (1)(a) to (d),

(a)

(b)

by agreement between the parties to the arbitration agreement.

The giving of a notice in accordance with subsection (1) shall not suspend
(2)
the  operation  of  the  detention  notice  unless,  on  the  application  of  the  person
making the referral, the arbitrator so directs.

The arbitrator shall have regard, in coming to his decision, to any other
(3)
matters not specified in the detention notice that appear to him to be relevant to
whether the ship was an unsafe ship.

404

Where on a reference under this section the arbitrator decides, as respects

(4)
any matter to which the reference relates,

the inspector’s opinion; and

405

(b)

it appears to him that there were no reasonable grounds for the inspector
to form that opinion,

the arbitrator may award the owner of the ship such compensation in respect of
any  loss  suffered  by  him  in  consequence  of  the  detention  of  the  ship  as  the
arbitrator thinks fit.

Any  compensation  awarded  under  this  section  shall  be  payable  by  the

arrangements  had  been  made  that  were  appropriate  to  ensure  that
before the ship went to sea it was made fit to do so without any serious
danger  to  human  life  by  reason  of  the  matters  relevant  to  its  safety
specified in the charge; or

(b)

it was reasonable for such arrangements not to have been made.

It shall also be a defence in proceedings for an offence under this section

(5)
to prove that

(a)

under the terms of a charter-party or management agreement entered
into by the accused,

(i)

(ii)

where the accused is the owner, his responsibilities with respect
to the matters relevant to the ship’s safety; or

(b)

in the circumstances of the case, the accused had taken reasonable steps
and exercised reasonable diligence to secure the proper discharge of
the relevant responsibilities during the period during which they had
been assumed by the person referred to in paragraph (a).

(6)
subsection (5), regard shall be had to

(a)

whether prior to the time of the alleged offence the accused was, or in
all  the  circumstances  ought  reasonably  to  have  been,  aware  of  any
deficiency  in  the  discharge  of  the  responsibilities  referred  to  in
subsection (5); and

a charter-party or management agreement referred to in paragraph (5)
(a),

(i)

to terminate it; or

(ii)

to intervene in the management of the ship,

in the event of any such deficiency, and whether it was reasonable for the accused
to place himself in that position.

by, or with the consent of, the Minister or the Director of Public Prosecutions.

In this section, “management agreement”, in relation to a ship, means an
(8)
agreement,  other  than  a  charter-party  agreement  or  contract  of  employment,

considers are necessary to enable him to exercise the powers conferred
on him under this section.

Nothing in this section authorizes a person to unnecessarily prevent a ship

(3)
from proceeding on a voyage.

The  Minister  may  make  regulations  providing  for  the  procedure  to  be

are to be dealt with.

Where  an  inspector  proposes  to  exercise  a  power  conferred  under

ship, he shall, if so requested by a person who at the time is present in, and has
responsibilities in relation to, the premises or ship, cause anything that is to be

inspector considers that that person’s presence would be prejudicial to the safety
of that person.

Before  exercising  the  power  under  paragraph  (2)(g),  an  inspector  shall
(6)
consult such persons as appear to him appropriate for the purpose of ascertaining
what dangers, if any, there may be in doing anything that he proposes to do under
that power.

Where under the power conferred under paragraph (2)(h) an inspector takes
(7)
possession of an article or substance found in any premises or ship, he shall leave
there with a responsible person or, if that is impracticable, fixed in a conspicuous

806

position,  a  notice  giving  particulars  of  the  article  or  substance  sufficient  to
identify it and stating that he has taken possession of it under that power.

Before  taking  possession  of  a  substance  under  paragraph  (2)(h),  an
(8)
inspector shall, if it is practicable for him to do so, take a sample of the substance
and give to a responsible person at the premises or on board the ship a portion of
the sample marked in a manner sufficient to identify it.

No answer given by a person pursuant to a requirement imposed under
(9)
paragraph (2)(i) shall be admissible in evidence against that person or the husband
or  wife  of  that  person  in  any  proceedings  except  proceedings  under  section
1058(1)(c) in respect of a statement in or a declaration relating to the answer.

(10)
on which questions are asked, to make representations to the inspector.

entitled to withhold on grounds of legal professional privilege.

(4)
A person who complies with a requirement imposed on him under section
1057(2)(i), (j) or (k) shall be entitled to recover from the person who imposed the
requirement  the  amount  of  any  expenses  incurred  in  complying  with  the
requirement as may be prescribed.

A prohibition notice shall

(a)

(b)

(c)

state that the inspector is of the opinion referred to in subsection (1);

An  improvement  notice  or  a  prohibition  notice  shall  not  direct  any
(2)
measures to be taken to remedy the contravention of a relevant statutory provision
that  are  more  onerous  than  those  necessary  to  secure  compliance  with  that
provision.

Where an improvement notice or a prohibition notice that is not to take

(3)

(a)

(b)

the notice may be withdrawn by an inspector at any time before the end
of the period specified in it under section 1060(2)(b) or section 1061;

as to whether directions included in a notice under section 1061(1) were
reasonable.

810

directs.

(3)

Where, on a referral under this section, an arbitrator decides that

(a)

a reason or matter to which the reference relates did not constitute a

(b)

the direction was unreasonable;

notice

(a)

(b)

Where  on  a  reference  under  section  1063  relating  to  a  prohibition

the arbitrator decides that a reason or matter did not constitute a valid
basis for the inspector’s opinion; and

to form that opinion;

the arbitrator may, subject to subsection (3), award the person on whom the notice
was  served  such  compensation  in  respect  of  any  loss  suffered  by  him  in
consequence of the service of the notice as the arbitrator thinks fit.

of any loss suffered by him in consequence of the direction as the arbitrator thinks
fit.

prohibiting any dealings with the ship or a share in it until the Court decides
definitely on the merits of the writ or until the Court revokes the provisional order.

If an order, other than a provisional order, is issued in order to secure a
(8)
claim that has not yet been judicially verified, unless proceedings on the merits
of the claim are already pending in a Barbados court, another competent court or
in arbitration, the plaintiff obtaining the order shall prosecute the claim in that
court or in arbitration within 8 working days after the issuance of the order.

If the plaintiff does not comply with subsection (8), the court issuing the
(9)
order shall, on the application of the owner or any other interested party, revoke
it.

(10)
Where the Court has issued a provisional order, the plaintiff shall prosecute
the claim within 30 days after the issuance of the provisional order or 8 days after
the issuance of the definite order, whichever is earlier.

Rules,  a  definite  or  provisional  order  given  under  this  section  shall  be
immediately enforceable.

An order issued under this section may be extended by the Court on the
(12)
application of the plaintiff for a further period or periods of not more than one
year, if the plaintiff confirms that the order is still required and the application is
filed at least 30 days prior to the lapse of the then current term of the order.

On an application under subsection (12), the Court shall extend the order
(13)
and the extension shall be notified to the defendant and served on the Registrar,
who shall enter the new expiry date in the register of the ship.

(14)

An order issued under of this section shall not affect

(a)

(b)

law;

a discharge of, or an amendment for the purpose of reducing the amount
secured by, a mortgage shall not be deemed to constitute a dealing with
a ship or share of one;

a guarantee by a Barbados bank or by a foreign bank of repute in the
currency of the claim shall qualify as satisfactory security; and

bank  issuing  the  guarantee  shall  unconditionally  submit  to  the
jurisdiction of the Barbados courts in so far as its obligations under the
guarantee are concerned.

Rights of mortgagee

(2)
or share, a subsequent mortgagee shall not, except under the order of a court of

937

competent jurisdiction, sell the ship or share without the concurrence of every
prior mortgagee.

If the proceeds of the sale of the ship or share exceed the cost of discharging
(3)
the mortgage debt, the mortgagee shall deposit the surplus for the benefit of other
creditors and of the mortgagor.

Except so far as may be necessary for making a mortgaged ship or share
(4)
available as a security for the mortgage debt, the mortgagee shall not by reason
of the mortgage be deemed to be the owner of the ship or share, nor shall the
mortgagor be deemed to have ceased to be its owner.

This section applies to all registered mortgages that secure debts resulting

(5)
from an account current or overdraft or other credit facility.

In  connection  with  the  enforcement  of  a  mortgage,  for  the  purpose  of

Where  the  Minister  is  informed  that  the  government  of  a  foreign
country desires that any of the provisions of this Act or the regulations that do
not apply to the ships of that country should so apply and there are no provisions
in  this  Act  for  that  application,  the  Minister  may  order  that  the  provisions
specified in the order apply, subject to any limitations specified in the order, to
the ships of that country, and to the owners, masters, seafarers and apprentices
of those ships, when not located within the jurisdiction of the government of that
country, in the same manner as if those ships were Barbados ships.

respect of the claim is inadequate, if the aggregate amount of security
does not exceed the value of the vessel;

947

(b)

the person who has provided the security is not, or is unlikely to be,
able to fulfil some or all of that person’s obligations; or

(c)

reasonable grounds, or

because the claimant could not by taking reasonable steps prevent

or who has procured the arrest of the vessel to provide security of a kind and for
an amount, and upon such terms, as may be determined by that court for any loss
that may be incurred by the defendant as a result of the arrest, and for which the
claimant may be found liable, including any loss or damage that may be incurred
by that defendant as a result of

(a)

(b)

the arrest having been wrongful or unjustified; or

excessive security having been demanded and provided.

Any  liability  of  a  claimant  in  accordance  with  subsection  (2)  shall  be

(2)
determined by application of the law of the state where the arrest was made.

of the case in accordance with section 1294, proceedings relating to the liability
of the claimant under subsection (1) may be stayed pending that decision.

Jurisdiction on the merits of the case

A court of the state in which an arrest has been effected or security
1294.(1)
provided to obtain the release of the vessel shall have jurisdiction to determine
the case upon its merits, unless the parties agree to submit the dispute to a court
of another state that accepts jurisdiction or to arbitration.

Notwithstanding subsection (1), a court of the state in which an arrest has
(2)
been made, or security provided to obtain the release of the ship, may refuse to
exercise that jurisdiction where that refusal is permitted by the law of that state
and a court of another state accepts jurisdiction.

Where  a  court  of  the  state  where  an  arrest  has  been  made  or  security

(3)
provided to obtain the release of a vessel

(a)

(b)

does not have jurisdiction to determine the case upon its merits; or

has refused to exercise jurisdiction in accordance with subsection (2),
the court may, and upon request shall, order a period of time within
which the claimant may bring proceedings before a competent court or
arbitral tribunal.

If  proceedings  are  not  brought  within  the  period  of  time  ordered  in
(4)
accordance with subsection (3), the vessel arrested or the security provided shall,
upon request, be ordered to be released.

If proceedings are brought within the period of time ordered in accordance
(5)
with subsection (3), or if proceedings before a competent court or arbitral tribunal
in  another  state  are  brought  in  the  absence  of  such  order,  any  final  decision

949

resulting  from  them  shall  be  recognized  and  given  effect  with  respect  to  the
arrested ship or to the security provided in order to obtain its release, if

(a)

the defendant has been given reasonable notice of the proceedings and
a reasonable opportunity to present the case for the defence; and

(b)

that recognition is not against public policy.

Subsection (5) shall restrict any further effect given to a foreign judgment
(6)
or arbitral award under the law of the state where the arrest of the vessel was
made or security provided to obtain her release.

production of the certificate of judicial sale, the registry in which the ship was

court or other judicial authority, the court or other judicial authority may request
the person producing the certificate to produce a certified translation into such
an official language.

Paragraphs 1 and 2 do not apply if the court or other judicial authority

determines that dismissing the application or ordering the release of the ship, as

the case may be, would be manifestly contrary to the public policy of Barbados
or a non-Barbados Convention State.

1306.(1)
The  courts  shall  have  exclusive  jurisdiction  to  hear  any  claim  or
application to avoid a judicial sale of a ship conducted in Barbados or a non-

of the certificate of judicial sale.

The courts shall decline jurisdiction in respect of any claim or application
(2)
to avoid a judicial sale of a ship conducted in another State Party that confers
clean title to the ship or to suspend its effects.

(3)
a court that avoids or suspends the effects of a judicial sale for which a certificate

be transmitted promptly to the relevant repository for publication.

Barbados.
