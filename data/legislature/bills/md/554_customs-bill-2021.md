begun an audit or verification of the declared particulars.

Notwithstanding  subsection  (2)(c),  the  Comptroller  may,  upon  a

55

(b)

(c)

45.(1)
Comptroller disputes the information provided on the declaration in respect of
the classification, origin or value of the goods and the declarant does not agree
with the assessment of the Comptroller, the Comptroller may direct that

(a)

(b)

the assessment be treated as a provisional assessment; and

the goods be provisionally cleared based on the payment of the amount
of duty calculated by the importer and the provision of a deposit by the
importer  for  an  amount  equal  to  any  additional  duty  provisionally
assessed.

Where the Comptroller is unable to make a proper assessment of the value
(2)
of goods to be entered due to the failure of the importer to produce satisfactory
documentary  evidence  of  the  value  of  the  goods,  the  Comptroller  may  direct
that

(a)

the  goods  be  examined,  and  a  provisional  assessment  made,  of  the
value and of the duty payable; and

56

(b)

the goods be provisionally cleared based on the payment of the amount
of duty calculated by the importer and the provision of a deposit by the
importer  for  an  amount  equal  to  any  additional  duty  provisionally
assessed.

Where goods are pending final clearance pursuant to subsection (1) or (2),

(3)
the Comptroller shall give notice in writing to the importer indicating

(a)

(b)

(c)

the provisional assessment made;

the basis for the assessment; and

the documents or other information relating to the value of the goods
that  the  importer  is  required  to  produce  within  30  days  of  the
provisional entry.

The amount of duty that was provisionally assessed under subsection (1)
(4)
or (2) shall be treated as the final assessment and the deposit paid shall be brought
to account as revenue where

(a)

(b)

the documents or other information required under subsection (3) have
not been produced within the specified time; or

the importer informs the Comptroller in writing before the expiration
of the specified time that he is unable to produce any further documents
or information,

unless  the  importer  commences  appeal  proceedings  within  the  required  time
period.

The Comptroller shall notify the importer of a final assessment determined

(5)
under subsection (4) within 2 weeks of the date of the assessment.

Where  the  additional  documents  or  other  information  required  under
(6)
subsection (3)(c) have been provided to the satisfaction of the Comptroller and
the duty assessed by the Comptroller is more than, or less than, the provisional
assessment made under subsection (1) or (2), the difference in duty shall either
be refunded to, or paid by the importer, as the case may be, and any bond secured
for the payment of duties or charges shall be cancelled.

of the goods, their reputation and the existence of a trademark are among
the factors to be considered in determining whether goods are similar;

(2)

For the purposes of this Part,

64

(a)

(b)

(c)

“identical goods” and “similar goods” do not include, as the case may
be,  goods  which  incorporate  or  reflect  engineering,  development,
artwork, design work, and plans and sketches for which no adjustment
has been made under section 60(1)(b)(iv) because such elements were
undertaken in the country of importation;

goods shall not be regarded as “identical goods” or “similar goods”
unless  they  were  produced  in  the  same  country  as  the  goods  being
valued;

goods produced by a different person shall be taken into account only
where there are no identical goods or similar goods, as the case may
be, produced by the same person as the goods being valued;

The customs value of imported goods shall be the transaction value,
59.(1)
that is, the price actually paid or payable for the goods when sold for export to
Barbados, adjusted in accordance with section 60, provided that

(a)

there are no restrictions on the disposition or use of the goods by the

related, that the transaction value is acceptable under subsections (2),
(3), (4) and (5).

In determining whether the transaction value is acceptable for the purposes

(2)
of subsection (1)

(a)

(b)

the fact that the buyer and the seller are related within the meaning of
section 57(d) shall not in itself be grounds for regarding the transaction
value as unacceptable; and

the  circumstances  surrounding  the  sale  shall  be  examined,  and  the
transaction  value  accepted,  provided  that  the  relationship  did  not
influence the price.

For the purposes of subsection (2), in a sale between related persons, the
(3)
transaction  value  shall  be  accepted,  and  the  goods  valued  in  accordance  with

(5)
importer and only for comparison purposes; and substitute values may not be
established under subsection (3).

grounds  to  the  importer  and  the  importer  shall  be  given  an  opportunity  to  be
heard.

Where the importer so requests, the Comptroller shall communicate the

Transaction value of identical goods

61.(1)

under section 59, the customs value shall be the transaction value of identical
goods sold for export to Barbados and exported at or about the same time, and
in a sale at the same commercial level and in substantially the same quantity, as
the goods being valued.

Where no such sale as described in subsection (1) is found, the transaction
(2)
value  of  identical  goods  sold  at  a  different  commercial  level  or  in  different
quantities  or  both,  adjusted  to  take  account  of  differences  attributable  to

adjustment leads to an increase or a decrease in the value.

Where the costs and charges referred to in section 60(1) are included in the
(3)
transaction  value,  an  adjustment  shall  be  made  to  take  account  of  significant
differences  in  such  costs  and  charges  between  the  imported  goods  and  the
identical goods in question arising from differences in distances and modes of
transport.

Where,  in  applying  this  section,  more  than  one  transaction  value  of
(3)
identical goods is found, the lowest such value shall be used to determine the
customs value of the imported goods.

under sections 59 and 61, the customs value shall be the transaction value of
similar goods sold for export to Barbados and exported at or about the same time,

quantities  or  both,  adjusted  to  take  account  of  differences  attributable  to
commercial  level  or  to  quantity  or  both,  shall  be  used,  provided  that  such
adjustments can be made on the basis of demonstrated evidence which clearly
establishes  the  reasonableness  and  accuracy  of  the  adjustment,  whether  the
adjustment leads to an increase or a decrease in the value.

Where the costs and charges referred to in section 60(1) are included in the
(3)
transaction  value,  an  adjustment  shall  be  made  to  take  account  of  significant
differences in such costs and charges between the imported goods and the similar
goods in question arising from differences in distances and modes of transport.

70

(4)
Where, in applying this section, more than one transaction value of similar
goods is found, the lowest such value shall be used to determine the customs
value of the imported goods.

Order or application of deductive value and computed value methods

Where the customs value of the imported goods cannot be determined
63.(1)
under sections 59, 61 and 62, the customs value shall be determined under section
64 or, where the customs value cannot be determined under that section, under
section 65.

Notwithstanding subsection (1), at the request of the importer, the order of

(2)
application of section 64 and section 65 shall be reversed.

Deductive value

Where the imported goods or identical or similar imported goods are
64.(1)
sold in Barbados in the condition as imported, the customs value of the imported
goods under this section shall be based on the unit price at which the imported
goods or identical or similar imported goods are so sold in the greatest aggregate
quantity, at or about the time of the importation of the goods being valued, to
persons  who  are  not  related  to  the  persons  from  whom  they  buy  such  goods,
subject to deductions for the following:

(a)

either

(i)

the commission usually paid or agreed to be paid; or

(ii)

the additions usually made for profit and general expenses,

in connection with sales in Barbados of imported goods of the same class
or kind;

(b)

(c)

the usual costs of transport and insurance and associated costs incurred
within Barbados; and

the customs duties and other taxes payable in Barbados by reason of
the importation or sale of the goods.

71

(2)
Where neither the imported goods nor identical nor similar imported goods
are sold at or about the time of importation of the goods being valued, the customs
value shall, subject to subsection (1), be based on the unit price at which the
imported goods or identical or similar imported goods are sold in Barbados in
the condition as imported at the earliest date after the importation of the goods
being valued but before the expiration of 90 days after such importation.

Where neither the imported goods nor identical nor similar imported goods
(3)
are sold in Barbados in the condition as imported, if the importer so requests, the
customs value shall be based on the unit price at which the imported goods, after
further  processing,  are  sold  in  the  greatest  aggregate  quantity  to  persons  in
Barbados who are not related to the persons from whom they buy such goods,
due  allowance  being  made  for  the  value  added  by  such  processing  and  the
deductions provided for in subsection (1).

Computed value

65.
on a computed value which shall consist of the sum of:

The customs value of imported goods under this section shall be based

(a)

(b)

the  cost  or  value  of  materials  and  fabrication  or  other  processing
employed in producing the imported goods;

an  amount  for  profit  and  general  expenses  equal  to  that  usually
reflected in sales of goods of the same class or kind as the goods being
valued which are made by producers in the country of exportation for
export to Barbados; and

(c)

the cost or value of all expenses referred to in section 60(1).

72

Residual method

66.(1)

(b)

on the basis of information available in Barbados.

No customs value shall be determined under this section on the basis of

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

the selling price in Barbados of goods produced in another country;

a system which provides for the acceptance, for customs purposes, of
the higher of two alternative values;

the price of goods on the domestic market of the country of exportation;

the cost of production other than computed values which have been
determined for identical or similar goods in accordance with section
65;

(e)

the price of the goods for export to a country other than Barbados;

(f)

minimum customs values; or

(g)

arbitrary or fictitious values.

Where the importer so requests, the importer shall be informed in writing
(3)
of  the  customs  value  determined  under  this  section  and  the  method  used  to
determine such value.

Provisional customs value by importer

67.(1)
An importer may include a provisional customs value in an entry for
imported goods where the customs value of the imported goods would have been
determined under the transaction value method but for the fact that at the time
the entry was made, any adjustments that were required to be made could not

73

have been made because of a lack of sufficient information or under an approval
given by the Comptroller in such circumstances as may be prescribed.

A provisional customs value shall be a reasonable estimate of the customs
(2)
value  of  the  imported  goods  based  on  the  information  that  is  available  to  the
importer at the time the entry is made.

Until the final customs value is provided, the provisional customs value

(3)
shall be treated as the customs value for the purposes of this Act.

An  approval  subject  to  any  terms,  conditions  or  restrictions  by  the

(4)
Comptroller may be required.

Reasons to doubt the truth or accuracy of particulars or documents

Where  a  customs  declaration  is  presented  and  the  Comptroller  has
68.(1)
reason to doubt the truth or accuracy of the particulars or documents produced
in support of the declaration, the Comptroller may require the importer to provide
further  explanation,  including  documents  or  other  evidence,  that  the  declared
value represents the total amount actually paid or payable for the imported goods,
adjusted in accordance with section 60.

Where, after receiving further information, or in the absence of a response,
(2)
the  Comptroller  still  has  reasonable  doubt  about  the  truth  or  accuracy  of  the
declared  value,  the  Comptroller  may  presume  that  the  customs  value  of  the
imported goods cannot be determined under section 59.

The Comptroller shall, before taking a final decision, communicate to the
(3)
importer, in writing if requested, the grounds for doubting the truth or accuracy
of  the  particulars  or  documents  produced;  and  the  importer  shall  be  given  an
opportunity to be heard.

Where a final decision is made, the Comptroller shall communicate to the

(4)
importer in writing his decision and the grounds therefor.

74

Revised customs value

Where the Comptroller is satisfied that the customs value of imported
69.
goods in an entry is incorrect, the Comptroller may revise the customs value and

(a)

(b)

the revised value shall be treated as the customs value for the purposes
of this Act; and

the Comptroller shall notify the importer of the revised value and the
basis  for  the  calculation,  including  the  findings  of  fact,  and  of  the
reasons for the decision and of the rights of the importer to review and
appeal against the decision.

Value of goods for export

70.

The customs value of goods for export shall

(a)

(b)

be the value of the goods at the point of exit; and

be determined by adding to the exporter’s ex-warehouse price of the
goods, the cost of transport and all incidental expenses up to the time
of export, not including export duties, taxes, fees and charges for which
the exporter has been granted a waiver in such circumstances as may
be prescribed.

(a)

(b)

were wholly produced within the Community; or

were produced within the Community wholly or partly from materials
imported from a state other than a Member State or from materials of
undetermined  origin  by  a  process  that  results  in  a  substantial
transformation characterized

Comptroller, that goods are of Community origin, the determination of whether
the goods are of Community origin may be made by the Comptroller without
regard to any proof of statements made by the importer.

Drawback in relation to Community origin goods

79.(1)
Notwithstanding  section  78,  Community  origin  goods  that  benefit

(2)
person  for  an  offence  referred  to  in  subsection  (1),  the  court  may  order  the
restoration of the goods forfeited to the person from whom the goods were seized,
and  where  such  an  order  is  issued,  the  conviction  does  not  have  effect  as  a
condemnation of the goods.

Where the court issues an order pursuant to subsection (2), the court may

(3)
impose such conditions as it thinks fit.

Subsection (2) does not apply where the goods have, before the conviction,

PART XXXI

GENERAL

Recovery of debt etc.

Any duty, tax, fee, penalty or other amount owing or payable under
274.(1)
this Act is a debt due the Government from and after the time such amount should
have been paid and is recoverable in civil proceedings before a magistrate’s court,
notwithstanding that the amount exceeds the normal limit on the jurisdiction of
the magistrate’s court.

The Minister may prescribe the rate of interest to be paid on any amount

(2)
owing or payable under this Act.

Unpaid tax certificate

Where an amount payable or remittable under this Act by a person,
275.(1)
has not been paid or remitted as required by this Act, the Comptroller may certify,
in a certificate called an “unpaid tax certificate”, that the amount is an amount
payable by that person under this Act.

An  unpaid  tax  certificate  may  be  filed  by  the  Comptroller  in  the
(2)
Magistrate’s Court for District “A” and shall be registered and after the expiry
of  14  days  after  it  is  filed  and  registered  has  the  same  force  and  effect  as  a
judgment in favour of the Government against the person for the amount specified

registration  of  the  certificate;  and  all  proceedings  may  be  taken  upon  the
certificate, and it may be enforced, as if it were a judgment of the court.

Certificate of Comptroller

276.
In  any  proceedings  in  which  the  Comptroller  issues  a  certificate
indicating that a person has paid or has not paid the charges or duties in respect
of  goods,  the  certificate  shall,  in  the  absence  of  evidence  to  the  contrary,  be
conclusive of the facts stated in the certificate.

187

Garnishment

277.(1)
Where the Comptroller knows or suspects that a person, in this section
referred to as the “third party”, is indebted to or is liable to make a payment to a
person who is liable to pay or remit an amount under this Act, the Comptroller
may, deliver to the third party a demand for payment stating the name of that
person and the amount payable or remittable by that person, and requiring the
third party to make the payment forthwith if the payment is then due and owing
and, if the payment from the third party to that person is not then due and owing,
as it becomes due and owing.

Where  the  Comptroller  delivers  a  demand  to  a  third  party  under
(2)
subsection (1), the third party shall pay to the Comptroller, on account of that
person’s liability under this Act, moneys otherwise payable by the third party to
that person as interest, rent, dividends, annuity, salary, wages, or other payment
until that person’s liability under this Act is satisfied or such amount as is due
from the third party to the person whichever is sooner.

Where  the  Comptroller  delivers  a  demand  to  a  third  party  under
(3)
subsection (1), the third party shall pay to the Comptroller, on account of the
liability under this Act of a person who is an officer or an employee of the third
party, moneys otherwise payable by the third party to that person as salary, wages
or other remuneration, and the third party shall continue to do so until the amount
due to that person is satisfied or until the amount demanded by the Comptroller
is satisfied, whichever is lesser.

A receipt issued by the Comptroller for moneys paid as required under this
(4)
section is a good and sufficient discharge of the third party’s original liability to
a person to the extent of the payment.

A third party who fails to comply with a requirement under subsection (1),
(5)
(2) or (3) is liable to pay to the comptroller an amount equal to the amount that
the third party was required to pay to the Comptroller under subsection (1).

Where an amount that would otherwise have been payable by a third party
(6)
to a person is paid by the third party to the Comptroller pursuant to a letter served

188

on the person under subsection (1) or pursuant to an assessment of an amount
payable by the third party under subsection (5), the person shall be deemed for
all  purposes  to  have  paid  the  amount  to  the  Comptroller  on  behalf  of  that
person.

The application of this section is subject to the Protection of Wages Act,

Where  the  Comptroller  suspects  that  a  person  is  about  to  leave
278.(1)
Barbados or in any other circumstances considers it appropriate for the protection
of the revenue to do so, the Comptroller may, before the day otherwise fixed for
payment,  deliver  to  that  person  a  notice  for  immediate  payment  stating  the
amount  that  the  Comptroller  believes  that  person  is  liable  to  pay  as  taxes  or
penalties under this Act or would be liable to pay if the time for payment had
arrived; and that person shall forthwith pay the amount specified in the notice for
immediate payment.

Where a person who has received a notice for immediate payment fails,
(2)
within 24 hours after the notice was served on him under subsection (1), to pay
forthwith  the  amount  specified  in  the  notice,  the  Comptroller  may  certify  the
amount in an unpaid tax certificate and require its registration in the Magistrate’s

adaptations or modifications as the circumstances require.

(3)
being forfeited under this Act, the fact that security has been given by bond or

189

280.(1)
Act, the directors or manager of the corporation at the time the corporation was
required  to  pay  the  duty  are  jointly  and  severally  liable,  together  with  the
corporation, to pay the duty and any penalties relating thereto.

subsection (1) has been proved.

A director or manager of a corporation is not liable for a failure to pay duty
(3)

diligence and skill to prevent the failure that a reasonably prudent person would
have exercised in comparable circumstances.

(4)
payable by him under this section more than 7 years after the duty becomes due
