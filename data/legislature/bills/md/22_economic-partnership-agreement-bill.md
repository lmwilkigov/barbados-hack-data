18

ARTICLE 16
Customs duties on imports of products originating in the EC Party

1.
Products originating in the EC Party shall not, on their importation into
the  CARIFORUM  States,  be  subject  to  customs  duties  higher  than  those
indicated in Annex III.

2.
Products originating in the EC Party shall, on their importation into the
CARIFORUM States, be exempt from all customs duties within the meaning of
Article 11 other than those listed in Annex III.

3.
For  a  period  of  ten  years  after  the  signature  of  this Agreement,  the
CARIFORUM States may continue to apply any such customs duties within the
meaning  of Article  11  other  than  those  listed  in  Annex  III  to  any  imported
product originating in the EC Party, provided that these duties were applicable
to this product on the date of signature of this Agreement, and that the same
duties  are  imposed  on  the  like  product  imported  from  all  other  countries.

4.
The  Signatory  CARIFORUM  States  shall  not  be  required  to  begin  a
phased elimination of the customs duties other than those listed in Annex III
and referred to in paragraph 2 in the seven years subsequent to the signature of
this  Agreement.  This  process  shall  be  accompanied  by  the  support  of  the
necessary fiscal reforms as provided for under Article 22.

With a view to ensuring transparency, such duties shall be notified to
5.
the CARIFORUM-EC Trade and Development Committee within six months of
the date of signature of this Agreement. Their elimination shall also be notified
promptly  to  the  CARIFORUM-EC  Trade  and  Development  Committee.

In  the  event  of  serious  difficulties  in  respect  of  imports  of  a  given

product,  the  schedule  of  customs  duty  reductions  and  eliminations  may  be
reviewed  by  the  CARIFORUM-EC  Trade  and  Development  Committee  by
common  accord  with  a  view  to  possibly  modifying  the  time  schedule  for
reduction  or  elimination.  Any  such  modification  shall  not  lead  to  the  time
periods in the schedule for which the review has been requested being extended
in respect of the product concerned beyond the maximum transitional period for
duty reduction or elimination for that product as provided for in Annex III. If the
CARIFORUM-EC Trade and Development Committee has not taken a decision
within thirty days of an application to review the timetable, the CARIFORUM
States may suspend the timetable provisionally for a period that may not exceed
one year.

Modification of tariff commitments

In the light of the special development needs of Antigua and Barbuda, Belize,
the Commonwealth of Dominica, Grenada, the Republic of Guyana, the Republic
of Haiti, Saint Christopher and Nevis, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the
Grenadines,  the  Parties  may  decide  in  the  CARIFORUM-EC  Trade  and
Development  Committee  to  modify  the  level  of  customs  duties  stipulated  in
Annex III, which may be applied to a product originating in the EC Party upon its
importation into the CARIFORUM States.  The Parties shall ensure that any
such modification does not result in an incompatibility of this Agreement with
the  requirements  of  Article  XXIV  of  the  GATT  1994.  The  Parties
may  also  decide  simultaneously  to  adjust  the  customs  duty  commitments
stipulated  in Annex  III  and  relating  to  other  products  imported  from  the  EC
Party, as appropriate.

ARTICLE 18
Movement of goods

The Parties recognise the goal of having customs duties levied only once on
originating goods imported into the EC Party or into the Signatory CARIFORUM
States. Pending the establishment of the necessary arrangements for achieving
this  goal,  the  Signatory  CARIFORUM  States  shall  exercise  their  best
endeavours in this regard. The EC Party shall provide the technical assistance
necessary for the achievement of this goal.

ARTICLE 19
More favourable treatment resulting from free trade agreements

With  respect  to  matters  covered  by  this  Chapter,  the  EC  Party  shall

a result of the EC Party becoming party to a free trade agreement with third
parties after the signature of this Agreement.

2.
With respect to matters covered by this Chapter, the CARIFORUM States
or any Signatory CARIFORUM State shall accord to the EC Party any more
favourable treatment applicable as a result of the CARIFORUM States or any
Signatory CARIFORUM State becoming party to a free trade agreement with
any major trading economy after the signature of this Agreement.

3.
The provisions of this Chapter shall not be so construed as to oblige the
EC  Party  or  any  Signatory  CARIFORUM  State  to  extend  reciprocally  any
preferential treatment applicable as a result of the EC Party or any Signatory
CARIFORUM State being party to a free trade agreement with third parties on
the date of signature of this Agreement.

respective  trade  and  customs  legislation,  provisions  and  procedures  shall  be
based  upon:
(a)

the  need  to  protect  and  facilitate  trade  through  enforcement  of  and
compliance  with  legislative  requirements  and  the  need  to  provide  for
additional  facilitation  for  traders  with  a  high  level  of  compliance;
the  need  to  ensure  that  requirements  for  economic  operators  are
reasonable, non-discriminatory, safeguard against fraud and do not lead
to the application of excessive penalties for minor breaches of customs
regulations or procedural requirements;
the  need  to  apply  a  single  administrative  document  or  electronic
equivalent  in  the  EC  Party  and  in  the  CARIFORUM,  respectively.
CARIFORUM States shall continue efforts to this end, with a view to
implementation  at  an  early  stage  after  the  entry  into  force  of  this
Agreement. A joint review of the situation shall be carried out 3 years
after the entry into force of the Agreement;
the  need  to  apply  modern  customs  techniques,  including  risk
assessment,  simplified  procedures  at  import  and  export,  post  release
controls  and  objective  procedures  for  authorised  traders.  Procedures
should be transparent, efficient and simplified, in order to reduce costs

the need for non-discrimination in terms of requirements and procedures
applicable to import, export and goods in transit, though it is accepted
that  consignments  might  be  treated  differently  according  to  objective
risk assessment criteria;
the  need  for  transparency.  To  this  end,  the  Parties  and  the  Signatory
CARIFORUM States agree to put in place a system of binding rulings on
customs matters, notably on tariff classification and rules of origin, in
accordance  with  rules  laid  down  in  their  respective  legislation;
the need for the progressive development of systems, including those
based upon Information Technology, to facilitate the electronic exchange
of  data  among  traders,  customs  administrations  and  related  agencies;

SECTION 1
PROVISIONS OF GENERAL APPLICATION

ARTICLE 85
Mutual recognition

1.
Nothing  in  this  Title  shall  prevent  the  EC  Party  and  the  Signatory
CARIFORUM  States  from  requiring  that  natural  persons  must  possess  the
necessary  qualifications  and/or  professional  experience  specified  in  the
territory  where  the  service  is  supplied,  for  the  sector  of  activity  concerned.

2.
The  Parties  shall  encourage  the  relevant  professional  bodies  in  their
respective  territories  to  jointly  develop  and  provide  recommendations  on
mutual recognition to the CARIFORUM-EC Trade and Development Committee,
for the purpose of the fulfilment, in whole or in part, by investors and service
suppliers  of  the  criteria  applied  by  the  EC  Party  and  by  the  Signatory
CARIFORUM States for the authorisation, licensing, operation and certification
of investors and service suppliers and, in particular, in the professional services
sector.

3.
In  particular,  the  Parties  shall  encourage  the  relevant  professional
bodies  in  their  respective  territories  to  start  negotiations  no  later  than  three
years after entry into force of this Agreement in order to jointly develop and
provide  such  recommendations  on  mutual  recognition,  among  others,  in  the
following  disciplines:  accounting,  architecture,  engineering  and  tourism.

On receipt of a recommendation referred to in the preceding paragraph,
4.
the  CARIFORUM-EC  Trade  and  Development  Committee  shall,  within  a
reasonable time, review the recommendation with a view to determining whether
it is consistent with this Agreement.

When,  in  conformity  with  the  procedure  set  out  in  paragraph  2,  a
recommendation  referred  to  in  the  same  paragraph  has  been  found  to  be
consistent with this Agreement and there is a sufficient level of correspondence
between the relevant regulations of the Parties and the Signatory CARIFORUM
States,  the  Parties  shall,  with  a  view  to  implementing  that  recommendation,
negotiate,  through  their  competent  authorities,  an  agreement  on  mutual
recognition  of  requirements,  qualifications,  licences  and  other  regulations.

Understanding on computer services

To the extent that trade in computer services is liberalised in accordance
1.
with Chapters 2, 3 and 4 of this Title, the EC Party and the Signatory CARIFORUM
States  subscribe  to  the  understanding  defined  in  paragraphs  2,  3  and  4.

CPC  84,  the  United  Nations  code  used  for  describing  computer  and
2.
related services, covers the basic functions used to provide all computer and
related services: computer programs defined as the sets of instructions required
to make computers work and communicate (including their development and
implementation),  data  processing  and  storage,  and  related  services,  such  as
consultancy  and  training  services  for  staff  of  clients.    Technological
developments  have  led  to  the  increased  offering  of  these  services  as  a
bundle or package of related services that can include some or all of these basic
functions. For example, services such as web or domain hosting, data mining
services and grid computing each consist of a combination of basic computer
services  functions.

##### (b)

3.
Computer and related services, regardless of whether they are delivered
via  a  network,  including  the  Internet,  include  all  services  that  provide:
consulting,  strategy,  analysis,  planning,  specification,  design,
(a)
development,  installation,  implementation,  integration,  testing,
debugging, updating, support, technical assistance, or management of
or for computers or computer systems; or
computer programs defined as the sets of instructions required to make
computers  work  and  communicate  (in  and  of  themselves),  plus
consulting,  strategy,  analysis,  planning,  specification,  design,
development,  installation,  implementation,  integration,  testing,
debugging,  updating,  adaptation,  maintenance,  support,  technical
assistance,  management  or  use  of  or  for  computer  programs;  or
data  processing,  data  storage,  data  hosting  or  database  services;  or
maintenance  and  repair  services  for  office  machinery  and  equipment,
including computers; or
training  services  for  staff  of  clients,  related  to  computer  programs,
computers  or  computer  systems,  and  not  elsewhere  classified.

Computer  and  related  services  enable  the  provision  of  other  services
(e.g.  banking)  by  both  electronic  and  other  means.  However,  there  is  an
important  distinction  between  the  enabling  service  (e.g.  web-hosting  or
application  hosting)  and  the  content  or  core  service  that  is  being  delivered
electronically (e.g. banking). In such cases, the content or core service is not

timely,  transparent  and  non-discriminatory  manner.  The  current  state  of

ARTICLE 100
Universal service

1.
The EC Party or any Signatory CARIFORUM State has the right to define
the  kind  of  universal  service  obligations  they  wish  to  maintain.

2.
Such  obligations  will  not  be  regarded  as  anti-competitive  per  se,
provided  they  are  administered  in  a  transparent,  objective  and  non-
discriminatory way. The administration of such obligations shall also be neutral
with respect to competition and not more burdensome than necessary for the
kind  of  universal  service  defined  by  the  EC  Party  and  by  the  Signatory
CARIFORUM States.

3.
All  suppliers  should  be  eligible  to  ensure  universal  service.  The
designation  shall  be  made  through  an  efficient,  transparent  and  non-
discriminatory mechanism. Where necessary, the EC Party and the Signatory
CARIFORUM  States  shall  assess  whether  the  provision  of  universal  service
represents an unfair burden on organisations(s) designated to provide univer-
sal  service.  Where  justified  on  the  basis  of  such  calculation,  and  taking
into account the market benefit, if any, which accrues to an organisation that
offers universal service, national regulatory authorities shall determine whether
a mechanism is required to compensate the supplier(s) concerned or to share the
net cost of universal service obligations.

practices  have  the  potential  to  distort  the  proper  functioning  of  markets  and
generally undermine the benefits of trade liberalisation. They therefore agree
that the following practices restricting competition are incompatible with the
proper functioning of this Agreement, insofar as they may affect trade between
the Parties:
(a)

agreements and concerted practices between undertakings, which have the
object or effect of preventing or substantially lessening competition in the
territory of the EC Party or of the CARIFORUM States as a whole or in a
substantial part thereof;
abuse by one or more undertakings of market power in the territory of the EC
Party or of the CARIFORUM States as a whole or in a substantial part
thereof.

##### (b)

ARTICLE 127
Implementation

1.
The  Parties  and  the  Signatory  CARIFORUM  States  shall  ensure  that
within five years of the entry into force of this Agreement they have laws in
force addressing restrictions on competition within their jurisdiction, and have
established the bodies referred to in Article 125(1).

2.
Upon entry into force of the laws and the establishment of the bodies
referred  to  in  paragraph  1,  the  Parties  shall  give  effect  to  the  provisions  of
Article 128. The Parties also agree to review the operation of this Chapter after
a confidence-building period between their Competition Authorities of six years
following the coming into operation of Article 128.

ARTICLE 128
Exchange of information and enforcement cooperation

1.
Each  Competition  Authority  may  inform  the  other  Competition
Authorities of its willingness to cooperate with respect to enforcement activity.
This cooperation shall not prevent the Parties or the Signatory CARIFORUM
States from taking autonomous decisions.

information. All exchange of information shall be subject to the standards of
confidentiality applicable in each Party and the Signatory CARIFORUM States.

3.
Any  Competition  Authority  may  inform  the  other  Competition
Authorities of any information it possesses which indicates that anticompetitive
business practices falling within the scope of this Chapter are taking place in
the other Party’s territory. The Competition Authority of each Party shall decide
upon  the  form  of  the  exchange  of  information  in  accordance  with  its  best
practices. Each Competition Authority may also inform the other Competition
Authorities  of  any  enforcement  proceeding  being  carried  out  by  it  in  the
following instances:

### (i)

######## (ii)

The activity being investigated takes place wholly or substantially
within the jurisdiction of any of the other Competition Authorities;
The remedy likely to be imposed would require the prohibition of
conduct in the territory of the other Party or Signatory CARIFORUM
States;

(iii) The activity being investigated involves conduct believed to have
been  required,  encouraged  or  approved  by  the  other  Party  or
Signatory CARIFORUM States.

Public enterprises and enterprises
entrusted with special or exclusive rights,
including designated monopolies

1.

State from designating or maintaining public or private monopolies according to
their respective laws.

2.
With  regard  to  public  enterprises  and  enterprises  to  which  special  or
exclusive rights have been granted, the Parties and the Signatory CARIFORUM
States  shall  ensure  that,  following  the  date  of  the  entry  into  force  of  this
Agreement, there is neither enacted nor maintained any measure distorting trade
in  goods  or  services  between  the  Parties  to  an  extent  contrary  to  the  Parties
interest, and that such enterprises shall be subject to the rules of competition in
so far as the application of such rules does not obstruct the performance, in law
or in fact, of the particular tasks assigned to them.

89

3.
By  derogation  from  paragraph  2,  the  Parties  agree  that  where  public
enterprises in the Signatory CARIFORUM States are subject to specific sectoral
rules  as  mandated  by  their  respective  regulatory  frameworks,  such  public
enterprises  shall  not  be  bound  or  governed  by  the  provisions  of  this Article.

4.
The Parties and the Signatory CARIFORUM States shall progressively
adjust, without prejudice to their obligations under the WTO Agreement, any
State monopolies of a commercial nature or character, so as to ensure that, by
the end of the fifth year following the entry into force of this Agreement, no
discrimination  regarding  the  conditions  under  which  goods  and  services  are
sold or purchased exists between goods and services originating in the EC Party
and those originating in the CARIFORUM States or between nationals of the
Member States of the European Union and those of the CARIFORUM States,
unless  such  discrimination  is  inherent  in  the  existence  of  the  monopoly  in
question.

5.
The  CARIFORUM-EC  Trade  and  Development  Committee  shall  be
informed about the enactment of sectoral rules provided for in paragraph 3 and
the measures adopted to implement paragraph 4.

the  Signatory  CARIFORUM  States  shall  endeavour  to  apply  the  Joint
Recommendation concerning the protection of marks, and other industrial property
rights in signs, on the Internet, as adopted by WIPO at the Thirty-Sixth Series of

1.
Protection afforded in respect of geographical indications in the EC Party and
the Signatory CARIFORUM States shall be granted in accordance with the legal
system and practice of the EC Party or the relevant Signatory CARIFORUM State as
the case may be, and shall be indefinite.26

2.
Such  protection  shall  ensure  that  the  use  of  geographical  indications  of
goods protected pursuant to paragraph 1 be exclusively reserved in the EC Party and
the Signatory CARIFORUM States to goods originating in the geographical area
concerned  and  that  are  produced  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  product
specifications.

3.
In respect of the protection of geographical indications, the EC Party and the
Signatory CARIFORUM States shall prohibit and prevent, ex officio or at the request
of an interested party:
(a)

regardless of the class of product on which it is used, the use in their territory
of any means in the designation or presentation of a good that indicates or
suggests that the good in question originates in a geographical area other
than the true place or origin in a manner which misleads the public as to the
true geographical origin of the good; or any other use which constitutes an
act of unfair competition within the meaning of Article 10bis of the Paris
Convention;
any use of the protected names for goods in the same class of product as the
geographical indication which do not originate in the geographical area
indicated, even where:
### (i)
######## (ii)
(iii)

the true origin of the good is indicated;
the geographical indication in question is used in translation;
the  name  is  accompanied  by  terms  such  as  "kind",  "type",  "style",
"imitation", "method" or other expressions of the sort.

##### (b)

4.
It shall be possible to cancel the registration of a geographical indication.
The procedure to this effect shall allow for the participation of any natural or legal
person having a legitimate interest.

C. Generic terms, plant varieties, animal breeds

1.
The EC Party and the Signatory CARIFORUM States shall not be required to
apply the protection of geographical indications referred to in section B with respect
to goods for which the relevant indication is identical with the term customary in
common language as the common name for such goods in their respective territories.

_________________________
26 For the purposes of this Article the use of an unlimited number of renewable periods of not less

than  ten  years  shall  be  considered  indefinite.

2.
Nothing  in  this  Section  shall  require  the  EC  Party  and  the  Signatory
CARIFORUM States to apply the protection of geographical indications referred to
in section B with respect to products of the vine, plants or animals for which the
relevant indication is identical with the name of a grape variety, plant variety or
animal breed existing in the territory of the EC Party or the Signatory CARIFORUM
State  concerned  as  of  the  date  of  entry  into  force  of  this  Agreement.

3.
Homonymous geographical indications shall be protected by the EC Party
and Signatory CARIFORUM States provided that there is a sufficient distinction in
practice  between  the  geographical  indication  first  protected  and  the  homonym
subsequently protected, having regard to the need to treat the producers concerned
in an equitable manner and not to mislead consumers. A homonymous name that
misleads the consumer in to believing that products come from another territory shall
not be protected by the EC Party or the Signatory CARIFORUM State concerned.

If a geographical indication of the EC Party or Signatory CARIFORUM State
4.
is homonymous with a geographical indication for a third country, Article 23(3) of the
TRIPS Agreement applies mutatis mutandis.

D.Relationship between geographical indications and trademarks

1.
A  geographical  indication  shall  not  be  registered  in  the  EC  Party  or  the
Signatory CARIFORUM States where, in the light of a trademark’s reputation and
renown and the length of time it has been used, registration is liable to mislead the
consumer as to the true identity of the product.

2.
From the date of entry into force of this Agreement, the registration of a
trademark which is identical with, similar to or containing a geographical indication
protected  respectively  in  the  EC  Party  or  in  the  Signatory  CARIFORUM  States
pursuant  to  section  B  and  relating  to  the  same  class  of  product  shall  be  refused

The  EC  Party  and  the  Signatory  CARIFORUM  States  shall  ensure  that,
subject to the provisions of section D(1), (2) and (3), a trademark, the use of which
corresponds to one of the situations referred to in section B(3), and which has been
applied for, registered or established by use, if that possibility is provided for by the
applicable legislation, in good faith within the territories of the EC Party or of a
Signatory  CARIFORUM  State,  before  the  date  of  application  of  the  WTO
obligations in the EC Party or a Signatory CARIFORUM State, or before the date of
application for protection of the geographical indication in the respective territories,
may  continue  to  be  used  notwithstanding  the  registration  of  the  geographical
indication, provided that no grounds for the invalidity or revocation of the trademark
exist as specified by the legislation of the EC Party or of the concerned Signatory
CARIFORUM State. In such case, the use of the geographical indication shall be
permitted alongside the relevant trademark.

E. Future protection agreement

The EC Party and the Signatory CARIFORUM States shall no later than 1 January
2014  commence  negotiations  aimed  at  an  agreement  on  the  protection  of
geographical  indications  in  their  respective  territories,  without  prejudice  to  any
individual requests for protection that may have been filed directly.

F. Internet use

The EC Party and the Signatory CARIFORUM States accept the need for a clear legal
framework for geographical indications owners who wish to use their geographical
indications  on  the  Internet  and  to  participate  in  the  development  of  electronic
commerce which includes provisions addressing whether the use of a sign on the
Internet  has  contributed  to  the  usurpation,  evocation,  acquisition  in  bad  faith  or
infringement of a geographical indication or whether such use constitutes an act of
unfair  competition,  and  a  determination  of  the  remedies,  including  the  eventual
transfer or cancellation of the domain name. In this respect, the EC Party and the
Signatory CARIFORUM States shall endeavour to apply the Joint Recommendation
concerning the protection of marks, and other industrial property rights in signs, on
the  Internet,  as  adopted  by  WIPO  at  the  Thirty-Sixth  Series  of  Meetings  of  the
Assemblies  of  the  Member  States  of  WIPO,  24  September  to  3  October  2001.

available to the public.

3.
A  design  shall  be  considered  to  have  individual  character  if  the  overall
impression  it  produces  on  the  informed  user  differs  from  the  overall  impression
produced on such a user by any design which has been made available to the public.

4.
This protection shall be provided by registration, and shall confer exclusive
rights  upon  their  holders  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  this  Article.

designs and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the owner of
the  protected  design,  taking  account  of  the  legitimate  interests  of  third  parties.

Design  protection  shall  not  extend  to  designs  dictated  essentially  by

2.
technical or functional considerations.

A design right shall not subsist in a design which is contrary to public policy

3.
or to accepted principles of morality.

D. Rights conferred

1.
The owner of a protected industrial design shall have the right to prevent
third  parties  not  having  the  owner’s  consent  from  making,  offering,  selling,
importing, stocking or using articles bearing, or embodying the protected design
when such acts are undertaken for commercial purposes, or unduly prejudice the
normal  exploitation  of  the  design  or  are  not  compatible  with  fair  trade  practice.

2.
For unregistered designs, the contested use shall not be deemed to result
from copying the protected design if it results from an independent work of creation
from a designer who may be reasonably thought not to be familiar with the design
made available to the public by the holder.

Provisional and precautionary measures

1.
The EC Party and the Signatory CARIFORUM States shall ensure that the
judicial  authorities  may,  at  the  request  of  the  applicant  issue  an  interlocutory
injunction intended to prevent any imminent infringement of an intellectual property
right,  or  to  forbid,  on  a  provisional  basis  and  subject,  where  appropriate,  to  a
recurring penalty payment where provided for by national law, the continuation of
the alleged infringements of that right, or to make such continuation subject to the
lodging of guarantees intended to ensure the compensation of the right holder where
an infringement is determined. An interlocutory injunction may also be issued, under
the same conditions, against an intermediary whose services are being used by a
third party to infringe an intellectual property right.

2.
An  interlocutory  injunction  may  also  be  issued  to  order  the  seizure  or
delivery up of the goods suspected of infringing an intellectual property right so as
to  prevent  their  entry  into  or  movement  within  channels  of  commerce.

In the case of an infringement committed on a commercial scale, the EC Party
and  the  Signatory  CARIFORUM  States  shall  ensure  that,  if  the  applicant
demonstrates circumstances likely to endanger the recovery of damages, the judicial
authorities  may  order  the  precautionary  seizure  of  the  movable  and  immovable

compliance with an injunction shall, where appropriate, be subject to a recurring
penalty  payment,  with  a  view  to  ensuring  compliance.  The  EC  Party  and  the

injured party instead of applying the measures provided for in Part III of the TRIPS
Agreement  or  in  this  Chapter  if  that  person  acted  unintentionally  and  without

they shall take into account all appropriate aspects, such as the negative
economic consequences, including lost profits, which the injured party
has suffered, any unfair profits made by the infringer and, in appropriate
cases, elements other than economic factors; or
as an alternative to (a), they may, in appropriate cases, set the damages
as a lump sum on the basis of elements such as at least the amount of
royalties  or  fees  which  would  have  been  due  if  the  infringer  had
requested  authorisation  to  use  the  intellectual  property  right  in
question.

Where the infringer did not know, or did not have reasonable grounds to
know, that he, she or it was engaging in infringing activity, the EC Party and the

procurement  of  their  procuring  entities  covered  by  this  Chapter  takes  place  in  a
transparent  manner  according  to  the  provisions  of  this  Chapter  and  the Annexes
pertaining thereto, treating any eligible supplier of either the Signatory CARIFORUM
States or the EC Party equally in accordance with the principle of open and effective
competition.

A. Supporting the creation of regional procurement markets

The Parties recognise the economic importance of establishing competitive

1.
regional procurement markets.

2.

(a) With  respect  to  any  measure  regarding  covered  procurement,  each

endeavour  not  to  treat  a  supplier  established  in  any  CARIFORUM
State  less  favourably  than  another  locally  established  supplier.
(b) With respect to any measure regarding covered procurement, the EC
Party  and  the  Signatory  CARIFORUM  States,  including  their
procuring entities:
### (i)

shall  endeavour  not  to  discriminate  against  a  supplier

services offered by that supplier for a particular procurement
are goods or services of either Party;
shall not treat a locally established supplier less favourably
than  another  locally  established  supplier  on  the  basis  of
degree of foreign affiliation to or ownership by operators or
nationals of any Signatory CARIFORUM State or of the EC
Party.

Subject to paragraph A.4, each Party, including its procuring entities, shall
with respect to any measure regarding covered procurement, accord to the goods

or services of any Party, treatment no less favourable than the treatment the Party,
including its procuring entities, accords to domestic goods, services and suppliers.

4.
The  Parties  shall  not  be  required  to  provide  the  treatment  envisaged  in
paragraph A.3 unless a decision by the Joint CARIFORUM-EC Council to this effect
is  taken.  That  decision  may  specify  to  which  procurements  by  each  Party  the
treatment  envisaged  in  paragraph A.3  would  apply,  and  under  which  conditions.

Transparency of government procurement

Subject to Article 180(4), each Party or Signatory CARIFORUM State shall
1.
promptly publish any law, regulation, judicial decision and administrative ruling of
general  application,  and  procedures,  regarding  procurement  covered  by  this
Chapter,  as  well  as  individual  procurement  opportunities,  in  the  appropriate
publications referred to in Annex VII including officially designated electronic media.
Each Party or Signatory CARIFORUM State shall promptly publish in the same

the others of any such modifications.

2.
The Parties and the Signatory CARIFORUM States shall ensure that their
procuring entities provide for effective dissemination of the tendering opportunities
generated by the relevant government processes, providing eligible suppliers with

and maintain an appropriate on-line facility to further the effective dissemination of
tendering  opportunities.
(a)

Tender  documentation  provided  to  suppliers  shall  contain  all
information  necessary  to  permit  them  to  submit  responsive  tenders.

any eligible supplier of the Parties.

3.
For each procurement covered by this Chapter, procuring entities shall, save
as otherwise provided, publish in advance a notice of intended procurement. Each
notice shall be accessible during the entire time period established for tendering for

include  the  subject-matter  of  the  procurement  and  the  planned  date  of  the
publication of the notice of intended procurement.

6.
Procuring entities operating in the utilities may use such a notice regarding
their future procurement plans as a notice of intended procurement provided that it
includes  as  much  of  the  information  set  out  in  paragraph  4  as  available  and  a
statement  that  suppliers  should  express  their  interest  in  the  procurement  to  the

fair manner; and
Indicate the time limit for submitting requests for participation.

Procuring Entities shall recognise as qualified suppliers all suppliers which

particular  supplier  and  no  reasonable  alternative  or  substitute  exists;
for reasons of extreme urgency brought about by events unforeseen by
the procuring entity, the products or services could not be obtained in
time  by  means  of  open  or  selective  tendering  procedures;
for  additional  deliveries  of  goods  or  services  by  the  original  supplier
where  a  change  of  supplier  would  compel  the  procuring  entity  to
procure  equipment  or  services  not  meeting  requirements  of
interchangeability with already existing equipment or services procured
under  the  initial  procurement  and  such  separation  would  cause
significant  inconvenience  or  substantial  duplication  of  costs  to  the
procuring entity;
when a procuring entity procures prototypes or a first product or service
which are developed at its request in the course of, and for, a particular
contract  for  research,  experiment,  study  or  original  development;
when additional services which were not included in the initial contract
but  which  were  within  the  objectives  of  the  original  tender
documentation  have,  through  unforeseen  circumstances,  become
necessary to complete the services described therein. However, the total
value of contracts awarded for the additional services shall not exceed
50 per cent of the amount of the original contract;
for new services consisting of the repetition of similar services which
conform  to  a  basic  project  for  which  an  initial  contract  was  awarded
following an open or selective procurement method, and for which the
procuring entity has indicated in the notice of intended procurement that
a limited procurement method might be used in awarding contracts for
such  new  services;
for products purchased on a commodity market;
in the case of contracts awarded to the winner of a design contest; in the
case  of  several  successful  candidates,  successful  candidates  shall  be
invited to participate in the negotiations as specified in the notice of the
intended procurement or the tender documents; and
for purchases made under exceptionally advantageous conditions which
only arise in the very short term in the case of unusual disposals such as
arising from liquidation, receivership or bankruptcy and not for routine
purchases from regular suppliers.

Rules of origin

The  EC  Party  and  the  Signatory  CARIFORUM  States  for  the  purposes  of  this
Chapter shall not apply rules of origin to goods or services imported from or supplied
by the EC Party and the Signatory CARIFORUM States as the case may be that are
different from the rules of origin applicable at the same time in the normal course of
trade to imports or supplies of the same goods or services from the same Signatory
CARIFORUM State or the EC Party.

ARTICLE 173
Technical specifications

1.
Consistent with the objectives of this Chapter, procuring entities shall ensure
that  technical  specifications  applied  or  intended  for  application  to  procurement
covered by the Chapter are set out in the notices of intended procurement and/or
tender documents.

2.
A procuring entity shall not seek or accept, in a manner that would have the
effect  of  precluding  competition,  advice  that  may  be  used  in  the  preparation  or
adoption of any technical specification for a specific procurement from a person that
may have a commercial interest in the procurement.

In  prescribing  technical  specifications  for  the  goods  or  services  being

3.
procured, a procuring entity shall, where appropriate:
(a)

specify the technical specifications, in terms of performance and functional
requirements,  rather  than  design  or  descriptive  standards;  and
base  the  technical  specifications  on  international  standards,  where  such
exist;  otherwise,  on  national  technical  regulations,  recognised  national
standards or building codes.

##### (b)

4.
Where  design  or  descriptive  characteristics  are  used  in  the  technical
specifications, a procuring entity shall, where appropriate, include words such as "or
equivalent" in the technical specifications and consider tenders that demonstrably
meet the required design or descriptive characteristics and are fit for the purposes
intended.

5.
A procuring entity shall not prescribe technical specifications that require or
###### refer  to  a  particular  trademark  or  trade  name,  patent,  copyright,  design  or  type,
##### specific origin, producer or supplier, unless there is no other sufficiently precise or intelligible way of describing the procurement requirements and provided that, in such cases, words such as "as equivalent" are included in the tender documentation.

ARTICLE 174
Qualification of suppliers

1.
For procurement covered by this Chapter, procuring entities shall ensure that
any conditions and criteria for participating in a public contract award procedure are
made  known  in  advance  in  the  notice  of  intended  procurement  or  the  tender
documents. Any  such  conditions  and  criteria  shall  be  limited  to  those  which  are
essential to ensure that the potential supplier has the ability to execute the contract
in question.

The Signatory CARIFORUM States and the EC Party shall not impose the
2.
condition that, in order for a supplier to participate in a procurement, the supplier has
previously been awarded one or more contracts by an entity of that Party or State or
that the supplier has prior work experience in the relevant territory. This paragraph
does not apply for procurements in respect of social impact surveys and studies.

3.
The procuring entity shall base its assessment of the financial, commercial
and technical abilities of a supplier on the conditions that it has specified in advance
in notices or tender documentation.

4.
Nothing in this Article shall preclude the exclusion of any supplier on grounds
such  as  bankruptcy  or  false  declarations  or  conviction  for  serious  crime.

Procuring entities may maintain a multi-use list provided that a notice inviting

5.
interested suppliers to apply for inclusion on the list is:
(a)
##### (b)

published annually; and
where published by electronic means, made available continuously in one of
the appropriate media listed in Annex VII.

##### (b)

Procuring entities shall ensure that suppliers may apply for qualification at
6.
any time through the publication of a notice inviting suppliers to apply for inclusion
on thelist containing the following information:
(a)

a description of the goods and services, or categories thereof, for which the
list may be used;
the conditions for participation to be satisfied by suppliers and the methods
that the procuring entity will use to verify a supplier’s satisfaction of the
conditions;
the  name  and  address  of  the  procuring  entity  and  other  information
necessary to contact the entity and obtain all relevant documents relating to
the list; and
the period of validity of the list and the means for its renewal or termination,
or where the period of validity is not provided, an indication of the method by
which  notice  will  be  given  of  the  termination  of  use  of  the  list.
Procuring entities shall include in the list all qualified suppliers within a reasonably
short time.

Where a non-qualified supplier submits a request for participation, and all
required documents relating thereto, within the time-limit, a procuring entity, whether
or not it uses a multi-use list, shall examine and accept the supplier’s request for
participation, unless, due to the complexity of the procurement, the entity is not able
to complete the examination of the request. Procuring entities shall also ensure that
a supplier having requested to be included in the list shall be informed of the decision
in this regard in a timely fashion.

8.
Procuring entities operating in the utilities may use a notice inviting suppliers
to apply for inclusion on a multi-use list as a notice of intended procurement and may
exclude requests for participation from suppliers not yet qualified in respect of the
procurement  on  the  grounds  that  the  procuring  entity  has  insufficient  time  to
examine the application.

ARTICLE 175
Negotiations

The Signatory CARIFORUM States and the EC Party may provide for their

1.
procuring entities to conduct negotiations:
(a)

in the context of procurements in which they have indicated such intent in
the notice of intended procurement; or
where it appears from the evaluation that no one tender is obviously the most
advantageous  in  terms  of  the  specific  evaluation  criteria  set  forth  in  the
notice of intended procurement or tender documentation.

A procuring entity shall:
ensure  that  any  elimination  of  suppliers  in  negotiations  is  carried  out  in
accordance  with  the  evaluation  criteria  set  out  in  the  notice  of  intended
procurement or tender documentation; and
when  negotiations  are  concluded,  provide  a  common  deadline  for  the
remaining suppliers to submit any new or revised tenders.

Unless a procuring entity decides that it is not in the public interest to
award  the  contract,  it  shall  award  the  contract  to  the  supplier  who  has  been
determined, on the basis of the information presented, to be fully capable of
undertaking  the  contract  and  whose  tender  is  either  the  lowest  tender  or  the
tender which in terms of the specific evaluation criteria set forth in the notice or
tender documentation is determined to be the most advantageous. Awards shall
be made in accordance with the criteria and essential requirements specified in
the  notice  of  intended  procurement  or  in  the  tender  documentation.

Information on contract award

The  Parties  and  the  CARIFORUM  Signatory  States  shall  ensure  that
their  procuring  entities  provide  for  effective  dissemination  of  the  results  of
government procurement processes.

2.
Procuring  entities  shall  promptly  inform  suppliers  of  decisions
regarding the award of the contract and, on request, in writing. Upon request,
procuring  entities  shall  inform  any  eliminated  supplier  of  the  reasons  for  the
rejection of its tender and of the relative advantages of the successful supplier’s
tender.

3.
Procuring entities may decide to withhold certain information on the contract
award where release of such information would interfere with law enforcement or be
otherwise contrary to the public interest, would prejudice the legitimate commercial
interests  of  suppliers,  or  might  prejudice  fair  competition  between  them.

4.
Subject to Article 180(4), no later than seventy two (72) days after the award
of each contract covered by this Chapter, a procuring entity shall publish a notice in
the  appropriate  paper  or  electronic  media  listed  in Annex  VII.  Where  only  an
electronic  medium  is  used,  the  information  shall  remain  readily  accessible  for  a
reasonable period of time. The notice shall include at least the following information:

procedure was used, a description of the circumstances justifying the use of
such  procedure.

take into account such factors as the complexity of the intended procurement
and the normal time for transmitting tenders.

2.
The  Parties  and  the  Signatory  CARIFORUM  States  shall  ensure  that

Bid challenges

1.
The  Parties  and  the  Signatory  CARIFORUM  States  shall  provide
transparent,  timely,  impartial  and  effective  procedures  enabling  suppliers  to
challenge  domestic  measures  implementing  this  Chapter  in  the  context  of
procurements in which they have, or have had, a legitimate commercial interest.
To  this  effect,  each  Party  or  Signatory  CARIFORUM  State  shall  establish,
identify or designate at least one impartial administrative or judicial authority
that is independent of its procuring entities to receive and review a challenge by
a supplier arising in the context of covered procurement.

2.
Each supplier shall be allowed a sufficient period of time to prepare and
submit a challenge as from the time when the basis of the challenge become
known  or  reasonably  should  have  become  known  to  the  supplier.  This
paragraph  does  not  preclude  Parties  or  Signatory  CARIFORUM  States  from
requiring complainants to lodge their complaints within a reasonable period of
time  provided  that  duration  of  that  period  is  made  known  in  advance.

3.
Procuring entities shall ensure their ability to respond to requests for a
review by maintaining a reasonable record of each procurement covered under

Should  a  review  by  the  CARIFORUM-EC  Trade  and  Development
Committee at the end of the implementation period reveal that one or several
Signatory CARIFORUM States need one more year to bring their measures into
conformity with the obligations of this Chapter, the CARIFORUM-EC Trade and
Development Committee may extend the implementation period referred to in

ENVIRONMENT

ARTICLE 183
Objectives and sustainable development context

1.
The Parties reaffirm that the principles of sustainable management of
natural resources and the environment are to be applied and integrated at every
level of their partnership, as part of their overriding commitment to sustainable
development  as  set  out  in  Articles  1  and  2  of  the  Cotonou  Agreement.

2.
The  Parties  recall  that Article  32  of  the  Cotonou Agreement  includes
environment  and  natural  resources  as  thematic  and  cross-cutting  issues,  and
that  the  fundamental  principles  of  ownership,  participation,  dialogue  and
differentiation  set  out  in  Article  2  of  the  Cotonou Agreement  are  therefore
particularly relevant.

3.
The  Parties  and  the  Signatory  CARIFORUM  States  are  resolved  to
conserve, protect and improve the environment, including through multilateral
and  regional  environmental  agreements  to  which  they  are  parties.

due regard to their respective level of development.

The Parties and the Signatory CARIFORUM States are resolved to make
5.
efforts to facilitate trade in goods and services which the Parties consider to be
beneficial  to  the  environment.  Such  products  may  include  environmental
technologies,  renewable-  and  energy-efficient  goods  and  services  and

Recognising  the  right  of  the  Parties  and  the  Signatory  CARIFORUM
1.
States to regulate in order to achieve their own level of domestic environmental
and public health protection and their own sustainable development priorities,
and to adopt or modify accordingly their environmental laws and policies, each
Party  and  Signatory  CARIFORUM  State  shall  seek  to  ensure  that  its  own
environmental and public health laws and policies provide for and encourage
high levels of environmental and public health protection and shall strive to
continue to improve those laws and policies.

The Parties agree that the special needs and requirements of CARIFORUM
2.
States shall be taken into account in the design and implementation of measures
aimed at protecting environment and public health that affect trade between the
Parties.

Provided  that  such  measures  are  not  applied  in  a  manner  that  would
3.
constitute  a  means  of  arbitrary  or  unjustifiable  discrimination  between  the
Parties  or  a  disguised  restriction  on  trade  between  them,  nothing  in  this
Agreement  shall  be  construed  to  prevent  any  Party  and  the  Signatory
CARIFORUM  States  from  adopting  or  maintaining  measures  necessary  to
protect  human,  animal  or  plant  life  or  health,  related  to  the  conservation  of
natural resources or protection of the environment.

Principles and general rules

The  Parties  agree  that  the  legal  and  regulatory  regimes  and  administrative
capacity to be established shall, at a minimum, include the following content
principles and enforcement mechanisms:
(a)

Content principles
### (i)

the  purpose  limitation  principle  –  data  should  be  processed  for  a
specific purpose and subsequently used or further communicated only
insofar as this is not incompatible with the purpose of the transfer. The
only exemptions to this rule would be those provided by legislation
and necessary in a democratic society for important public interests;
the data quality and proportionality principle – data should be accurate
and, where necessary, kept up to date. The data should be adequate,
relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they
are transferred or further processed;
the  transparency  principle  –  individuals  should  be  provided  with
information as to the purpose of the processing and the identity of the
data controller in the third country, and other information insofar as
this is necessary to ensure fairness. The only exemptions permitted
should be those provided by legislation and necessary in a democratic
society for important public interests;
the security principle – technical and organisational security measures
should be taken by the data controller that are appropriate to the risks
presented by the processing. Any person acting under the authority of
the data controller, including a processor, must not process data except
on instructions from the controller;
the  rights  of  access,  rectification  and  opposition  –  the  data  subject
should have a right to obtain a copy of all data relating to him/her that
are processed, and a right to rectification of those data where they are
shown  to  be  inaccurate.  In  certain  situations  he/she  should  also  be
able to object to the processing of the data relating to him/her. The only
exemptions to these rights should be those provided by legislation and
necessary  in  a  democratic  society  for  important  public  interests;
restrictions  on  onward  transfers  –  as  a  matter  of  principle,  further
transfers  of  the  personal  data  by  the  recipient  of  the  original  data
transfer should be permitted only where the second recipient (i.e. the
recipient of the onward transfer) is also subject to rules affording an
adequate level of protection;

revealing  racial  or  ethnic  origin,  political  opinions,  religious  or
philosophical beliefs or tradeunion membership, data concerning health
or  sex  life,  and  data  relating  to  offences,  criminal  convictions  or
security  measures,  data  may  not  be  processed  unless  domestic  law
provides additional safeguards.

Enforcement mechanisms
Appropriate  mechanisms  shall  be  in  place  to  ensure  that  the  following
objectives are achieved:

among data subjects of their rights and the means of exercising them;
the  existence  of  effective  and  dissuasive  sanctions;  and  systems  of
direct  verification  by  authorities,  auditors,  or  independent  data
protection officials;
to provide support and help to individual data subjects in the exercise
of their rights, who must be able to enforce their rights rapidly and
effectively,  and  without  prohibitive  cost,  including  through
appropriate  institutional  mechanisms  allowing  independent
investigation of complaints;

compatible  with  that  Party’s  obligations  under  the  provisions  of  this
Agreement,  the  Party  complained  against  shall,  if  so  requested  by  the
complaining Party, present an offer for compensation. Nothing in the Agreement

2.
If no agreement on compensation is reached within thirty (30) days of the
end of the reasonable period of time or of the arbitration panel’s ruling under
Article 212 that a measure taken to comply is not compatible with the provisions
of this Agreement, the complaining Party shall be entitled, upon notification to
the other Party, to adopt appropriate measures. In adopting such measures the
complaining  Party  shall  endeavour  to  select  measures  that  least  affect  the
attainment of the objectives of this Agreement and shall take into consideration
their  impact  on  the  economy  of  the  Party  complained  against  and  on  the
individual CARIFORUM States. In addition, where the EC Party has obtained
the right to adopt such measures, it shall select measures which are specifically
aimed  at  bringing  into  compliance  the  CARIFORUM  State  or  States  whose
measures were found to be in breach of this Agreement. The other CARIFORUM
States shall facilitate the adoption of measures to comply with the arbitration
panel ruling by the CARIFORUM State or States found to be in breach. In cases
involving a dispute under Chapter 4 and 5 of Title IV, appropriate measures shall
not  include  the  suspension  of  trade  concessions  under  this  Agreement.  The
complaining Party may adopt the appropriate measures ten (10) days after the
date of the notification.

The EC Party shall exercise due restraint in asking for compensation or

to comply with the ruling of the arbitration panel and of its request for an end to
application of appropriate measures by the complaining Party.

2.
If  the  Parties  do  not  reach  an  agreement  on  the  compatibility  of  the
notified measure with the provisions of this Agreement within thirty (30) days of
the  date  of  the  submission  of  the  notification,  the  complaining  Party  shall
request in writing the arbitration panel to rule on the matter. Such request shall
be  notified  to  the  other  Party  and  to  the  CARIFORUM-EC  Trade  and
Development Committee. The arbitration panel ruling shall be notified to the
Parties and to the CARIFORUM-EC Trade and Development Committee within
forty five (45) days of the date of the submission of the request. If the arbitration
panel  rules  that  any  measure  taken  to  comply  is  not  in  conformity  with  the
provisions  of  this  Agreement,  the  arbitration  panel  will  determine
whether the complaining Party can continue to apply appropriate measures. If
the arbitration panel rules that any measure taken to comply is in conformity
with  the  provisions  of  this  Agreement,  the  appropriate  measures  shall  be
terminated.

In the event of the original arbitration panel, or some of its members,

ARTICLE 7

Sufficiently worked or processed products

1.  For  the  purposes  of  Article  2,  products  which  are  not  wholly  obtained  are  considered  to  be
sufficiently worked or processed when the conditions set out in the List in Annex II are fulfilled.

2.  The  conditions  referred  to  in  paragraph  1  above  indicate,  for  all  products  covered  by  this
Agreement, the working or processing which must be carried out on non-originating materials used
in  manufacturing  and  apply  only  in  relation  to  such  materials.  Accordingly,  it  follows  that  if  a
product, which has acquired originating status by fulfilling the conditions set out in the List is used
in  the  manufacture  of  another  product,  the  conditions  applicable  to  the  product  in  which  it  is
incorporated do not apply to it, and no account shall be taken of the non-originating materials which
may have been used in its manufacture.

3. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, non-originating materials which, according to the conditions set out
in  Annex  II  should  not  be  used  in  the  manufacture  of  a  given  product  may  nevertheless  be  used,
provided that:

(a) their total value does not exceed 15 per cent of the ex-works price of the product;

(b) any of the percentages given in the List for the maximum value of non-originating materials are
not exceeded through the application of this paragraph.

5. Paragraphs 1 to 4 shall apply except as provided in Article 8.

ARTICLE 8

Insufficient working or processing

operations  to  ensure  the  preservation  of  products  in  good  condition  during  transport  and

1.  Without  prejudice to paragraph 2, the following operations shall be considered as insufficient
working or processing to confer the status of originating products, whether or not the requirements
of Article 7 are satisfied:
(a)
storage;
####### (b) (c)
(d)
(e)
(f)

breaking-up and assembly of packages;
washing, cleaning; removal of dust, oxide, oil, paint or other coverings;
ironing or pressing of textiles;
painting and polishing operations;
husking, partial or total bleaching, polishing, and glazing of cereals and rice;

182

operations to colour sugar or form sugar lumps; partial or total milling of crystal sugar;1
peeling, stoning and shelling, of fruits, nuts and vegetables;
sharpening, simple grinding or simple cutting;
sifting, screening, sorting, classifying, grading, matching (including the making-up of sets of

simple placing in bottles, cans, flasks, bags, cases, boxes, fixing on cards or boards and all

affixing  or  printing  marks,  labels,  logos  and other  like  distinguishing  signs  on products  or

simple mixing of products, whether or not of different kinds; mixing of sugar with any other

simple  assembly  of  parts  of  articles  to  constitute  a  complete  article  or  disassembly  of

(g)
(h)
### (i)
### (j)
articles);
(k)
other simple packaging operations;
(l)
their packaging;
(m)
material;
(n)
products into parts;
(o)
(p)

a combination of two or more operations specified in (a) to (n);
slaughter of animals.

All operations carried out either in the EC Party or in the CARIFORUM States on a given
2.
product  shall  be  considered  together  when  determining  whether  the  working  or  processing
undergone by that product is to be regarded as insufficient within the meaning of paragraph 1.

ARTICLE 9

Unit of qualification

1.  The  unit  of  qualification  for  the  application  of  the  provisions  of  this  Protocol  shall  be  the
particular  product  which  is  considered  as  the  basic  unit  when  determining  classification  using  the
nomenclature of the Harmonized System.

Accordingly, it follows that:

(a) when a product composed of a group or assembly of articles is classified under the terms of the
Harmonized System in a single heading, the whole constitutes the unit of qualification;

(b)  when  a  consignment  consists  of  a  number  of  identical  products  classified  under  the  same
heading  of  the  Harmonized  System,  each  product  must  be  taken  individually  when  applying  the
provisions of this Protocol.

2. Where, under General Rule 5 of the Harmonized System, packaging is included with the product
for classification purposes, it shall be included for the purposes of determining origin.

ARTICLE 10

Accessories, spare parts and tools

Accessories,  spare  parts  and  tools  dispatched  with  a  piece  of  equipment,  machine,  apparatus  or
vehicle, which are part of the normal equipment and included in the price thereof or which are not
separately  invoiced,  shall  be  regarded  as  one  with  the  piece  of  equipment,  machine,  apparatus  or
vehicle in question.

1 This is understood to mean the reduction of the size of the sugar particles as a result of grinding or milling.

183

ARTICLE 11

Sets

Sets, as defined in General Rule 3 of the Harmonized System, shall be regarded as originating when
all  component  products  are  originating.  Nevertheless,  when  a  set  is  composed  of  originating  and
non-originating products, the set as a whole shall be regarded as originating, provided that the value
of the non-originating products does not exceed 15 per cent of the ex-works price of the set.

ARTICLE 12

Neutral elements

In  order  to  determine  whether  a  product  is  originating,  it  shall  not  be  necessary  to  determine  the
origin of the following which might be used in its manufacture:

(a) energy and fuel;

(b) plant and equipment;

(c) machines and tools;

(d) goods which do not enter and which are not intended to enter into the final composition of the
product.

constituting  one  single  consignment  may  be  transported  through  other  territories  with,  should  the
occasion  arise,  trans-shipment  or  temporary  warehousing  in  such  territories,  provided  that  they
remain under the surveillance of the customs authorities in the country of transit or warehousing and
do  not  undergo  operations  other  than  unloading,  reloading  or  any  operation  designed  to  preserve
them in good condition.

Originating  products  may  be  transported  by  pipeline  across  territory  other  than  that  of  a
CARIFORUM State, of the EC Party or of an OCT.

2.  Evidence  that the  conditions  set  out  in  paragraph  1  have  been  fulfilled shall  be  supplied  to  the
customs authorities of the importing country by the production of:

(iii) certifying the conditions under which the products remained in the transit country; or

(c) failing these, any substantiating documents.

ARTICLE 15

country or territory other than those referred to in Articles 3, 4 and 5 and sold after the exhibition for
importation  into  the  EC  Party  or  a  CARIFORUM  State  shall  benefit  on  importation  from  the
provisions of the Agreement provided it is shown to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that:

public  show  or  display which  is  not  organized  for  private  purposes  in  shops  or business premises
with  a  view  to  the  sale  of  foreign  products,  and during  which  the  products  remain  under  customs
control.

TITLE IV

2. Proof of origin which are submitted to the customs authorities of the importing country after the
final  date  for  presentation  specified  in  paragraph  1  may  be  accepted  for  the  purpose  of  applying
preferential  treatment,  where  the  failure  to  submit  these  documents  by  the  final  date  set  is  due  to
exceptional circumstances.

3.  In  other  cases  of  belated  presentation,  the  customs  authorities  of  the  importing  country  may
accept the proofs of origin where the products have been submitted before the said final date.

ARTICLE 24

Submission of proof of origin

Proof of origin shall be submitted to the customs authorities of the importing country in accordance
with  the  procedures  applicable  in  that  country.  The  said  authorities  may  require  a  translation of  a
proof of origin and may also require the import declaration to be accompanied by a statement from
the importer to the effect that the products meet the conditions required for the implementation of
the Agreement.

ARTICLE 25

Importation by instalments

Where, at the request of the importer and on the conditions laid down by the customs authorities of
the importing country, dismantled or non-assembled products within the meaning of General Rule
2(a) of the Harmonized System falling within Sections XVI and XVII or heading 7308 and 9406 of
the Harmonized System are imported by instalments, a single proof of origin for such products shall
be submitted to the customs authorities upon importation of the first instalment.

ARTICLE 26

Exemptions from proof of origin

1.  Products  sent  as  small  packages  from  private  persons  to  private  persons  or  forming  part  of
travellers’  personal  luggage  shall  be  admitted  as  originating  products  without  requiring  the
submission of a proof of origin, provided that such products are not imported by way of trade and
have been declared as meeting the requirements of this Protocol and where there is no doubt as to
the veracity of such a declaration. In the case of products sent by post, this declaration can be made
on customs declaration CN22/CN23 or on a sheet of paper annexed to that document.

2. Imports which are occasional and consist solely of products for the personal use of the recipients
or travellers or their families shall not be considered as imports by way of trade if it is evident from
the nature and quantity of the products that no commercial purpose is in view.

3.  Furthermore,  the  total  value  of  these  products  shall  not  exceed  EUR  500  in  the  case  of  small
packages or EUR 1 200 in the case of products forming part of travellers’ personal luggage.

ARTICLE 27

Information procedure for cumulation purposes

1.  When  Articles  2(3),  3(1)  and  4(1)  are  applied,  the  evidence  of  originating  status  within  the
meaning of this Protocol of the materials coming from a CARIFORUM State, from the EC Party,
from another ACP State or from an OCT shall be given by a movement certificate EUR 1 or by the
supplier’s  declaration,  a  specimen  of  which appears  in  Annex  IX  A  to this Protocol, given by the
exporter in the State or in the EC Party from which the materials came.

2. When Articles 2(3), 3(2) and 4(2) are applied, the evidence of the working or processing carried
out in a CARIFORUM State, in the EC Party, in another ACP State or in an OCT shall be given by
the  supplier’s  declaration,  a  specimen  of  which  appears  in  Annex  V  A  and  Annex  V  B  to  this
Protocol, given by the exporter in the State or in the EC Party from which the materials came.

3.  A  separate  supplier’s  declaration  shall  be  made  up  by  the  supplier  for  each  consignment  of
material on the commercial invoice related to that shipment or in an annex to that invoice, or on a
delivery note or other commercial document related to that shipment which describes the materials
concerned in sufficient detail to enable them to be identified.

4. The supplier’s declaration may be made out on a pre-printed form.

5.  The  suppliers’  declarations  shall  bear  the  original  signature  of  the  supplier  in  manuscript.
However,  where  the  invoice  and  the  supplier’s  declaration  are  established  using  electronic  data-
processing  methods,  the  supplier’s  declaration  need  not  be  signed  in  manuscript  provided  the
responsible  official  in  the  supplying  company  is  identified  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  customs
authorities  in  the  State  where  the  suppliers’  declarations  are  established.  The  said  customs
authorities may lay down conditions for the implementation of this paragraph.

6. The supplier’s declarations shall be submitted to the customs authorities in the exporting country
requested to issue the movement certificate EUR 1.

7. The supplier making out a declaration must be prepared to submit at any time, at the request of
the customs authorities of the country where the declaration is made out, all appropriate documents
proving that the information given on this declaration is correct.

8. Suppliers’ declarations made and information certificates issued before the date of application of
this  Protocol  in  accordance  with  Article  26  of  Protocol 1  to  the  Cotonou  Agreement  shall  remain
valid.

Articles  3, 4 and 5 where these documents are used in accordance with domestic law;

(c)  documents  proving  the  working  or  processing  of  materials  in  the  CARIFORUM  States,  in  the
EC Party or in one of the other countries or territories referred to in Articles 3 and 4 issued or made
out in a CARIFORUM State, in the EC Party or in one of the other countries or territories referred
to in Articles 3 and 4 where these documents are used in accordance with domestic law;

(d) movement certificates EUR.1 or invoice declarations proving the originating status of materials
used,  issued  or  made  out  in  the  CARIFORUM  States,  in  the  EC  Party  or  in  one  of  the  other

certificates EUR.1 and the invoice declarations submitted to them.

ARTICLE 30

Discrepancies and formal errors

1.  The  discovery  of  slight  discrepancies  between  the  statements  made  in  the  proof  of  origin  and
those  made  in  the  documents  submitted  to  the  customs  office  for  the  purpose  of  carrying  out  the
formalities for importing the products shall not ipso facto render the proof of origin null and void if
it is duly established that this document does correspond to the products submitted.

2. Obvious formal errors such as typing errors on a proof of origin should not cause this document
to  be  rejected  if  these  errors  are  not  such  as  to  create  doubts  concerning  the  correctness  of  the
statements made in this document.

ARRANGEMENTS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COOPERATION

ARTICLE 31

Administrative conditions for products to benefit from the Agreement

Products originating within the meaning of this Protocol in the CARIFORUM States or in the EC
Party  shall  benefit  from  the  preferences  resulting  from  the  Agreement  only  on  condition  that  the
necessary arrangements, structures and systems required for the implementation and enforcement of
the rules and procedures laid down in this Protocol are in place.

ARTICLE 32

Notification of information related to customs authorities

1.  The  CARIFORUM  States  and  the  Member  States  of  the  EC  Party  shall  provide  each  other,
through  the  Commission  of  the  European  Communities,  with  the  addresses  of  the  customs
authorities  responsible  for  issuing  and  verifying  of  movement  certificates  EUR.1  and  invoice
declarations  or  supplier's  declarations,  and  with  specimen  impressions  of  the  stamps  used in  their
customs offices for the issue of these certificates.

Movement  certificates  EUR.1  and invoice declarations or supplier's declarations shall be accepted
for the purpose of applying preferential treatment from the date the information is received by the
Commission of the European Communities.

2. The CARIFORUM States and the Member States of the European Union shall inform each other
through  the  Commission  of  the  European  Communities  immediately  whenever  there  are  any
changes to the information referred to in paragraph 1.

ARTICLE 33

Mutual assistance

In  order  to  ensure  the  proper  application  of  this  Protocol,  the  EC  Party,  the  CARIFORUM  States
and  the  other  countries  referred  to  in  Articles  3,  4  and  5  shall  assist  each  other,  through  the
competent  customs  administrations,  in  checking  the  authenticity  of  the  movement  certificates
EUR.1, the invoice declarations or the supplier’s declarations and the correctness of the information
given in these documents.

The  authorities  consulted  shall  furnish  the  relevant  information  concerning  the  conditions  under
which the product has been made, indicating especially the conditions in which the rules of origin
have been respected in the various CARIFORUM States, Member States of the European Union and
other countries referred to in Articles 3, 4 and 5 concerned.

ARTICLE 34

Verification of proof of origin

1.  Subsequent  verifications  of  proof  of  origin  shall  be  carried  out  at  random  or  based  on  risk
analysis or whenever the customs authorities of the importing country have reasonable doubts as to

193

the authenticity of such documents, the originating status of the products concerned or the fulfilment
of the other requirements of this Protocol.

2.  For  the  purposes  of  implementing  the  provisions of paragraph 1, the customs authorities of the
importing  country  shall  return  the  movement  certificate  EUR.1  and  the  invoice,  if  it  has  been
submitted, the invoice declaration, or a copy of these documents, to the customs authorities of the
exporting  country  giving,  where  appropriate,  the  reasons  for  the  request  for  verification.  Any
documents and information obtained suggesting that the information given on the proof of origin is
incorrect shall be forwarded in support of the request for verification.

3. The verification shall be carried out by the customs authorities of the exporting country. For this
purpose,  they  shall  have  the  right  to  call  for  any  evidence  and  to  carry  out  any  inspection  of  the
exporter’s accounts or any other check considered appropriate.

4. If the customs authorities of the importing country decide to suspend the granting of preferential
treatment  to  the  products  concerned  while  awaiting  the  results  of  the  verification,  release  of  the
products shall be offered to the importer subject to any precautionary measures judged necessary.

5.  The  customs  authorities  requesting  the  verification  shall  be  informed  of  the  results  of  this
verification  as  soon  as  possible.  These  results  must  indicate  clearly  whether  the  documents  are
authentic  and  whether  the  products  concerned  can  be  considered  as  products  originating  in  a
CARIFORUM State, in the EC Party or in one of the other countries referred to in Article 3, 4 and 5
and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol.

6. If in cases of reasonable doubt there is no reply within ten months of the date of the verification
request  or  if  the  reply  does  not  contain  sufficient  information  to  determine  the  authenticity  of  the
document  in  question  or  the  real  origin  of  the  products,  the  requesting  customs  authorities  shall,
except in exceptional circumstances, refuse entitlement to the preferences.

7. Where the verification procedure or any other available information appears to indicate that the
provisions of this Protocol are being contravened, the exporting country on its own initiative or at
the  request  of  the  importing  country  shall  carry  out  appropriate  enquires  or  arrange  for  such
enquiries to be carried out with due urgency to identify and prevent such contraventions and for this
purpose  the  exporting  country  concerned  may  invite  the  participation  of  the  importing  country  in
these enquiries.

ARTICLE 35

Verification of suppliers’ declarations

1. Verification of suppliers’ declarations shall be carried out at random or based on risk analysis or
whenever the customs authorities of the importing State have reasonable doubt as to the authenticity
of the document or the accuracy or completeness of the information concerning the true origin of the
materials in question.

2. The customs authorities to which a supplier’s declaration is submitted may request the customs
authorities  of  the  State  where  the  declaration  was  made  to  issue  an  information  certificate,  a
specimen of which appears in Annex VI to this Protocol. Alternatively, the customs authorities to
which  a  supplier’s  declaration  is  submitted  may  request  the  exporter  to  produce  an  information
certificate issued by the customs authorities of the State where the declaration was made.

194

A copy of the information certificate shall be preserved by the office which has issued it for at least
three years.

3.  The  customs  authorities  requesting  the  verification  shall  be  informed  of  the  results  thereof  as
soon  as  possible.  The results  must  indicate clearly whether the information given in the supplier's
declaration is correct and make it possible for the customs authorities to determine whether and to
what extent this supplier's declaration could be taken into account for issuing a movement certificate
EUR.1 or for making out an invoice declaration.

4. The verification shall be carried out by the customs authorities of the country where the supplier's
declaration was made out. For this purpose, they shall have the right to call for any evidence or to
carry out any inspection of the supplier's account or any other check which they consider appropriate
in order to verify the correctness of any supplier’s declaration.

5.  Any  movement  certificate  EUR.1  or  invoice  declaration  issued  or  made  out  on  the  basis  of  an
incorrect supplier’s declaration shall be considered null and void.

ARTICLE 36

Dispute settlement

Where disputes arise in relation to the verification procedures of Articles 34 and 35 which cannot be
settled  between  the  customs  authorities  requesting  a  verification  and  the  customs  authorities
responsible for carrying out this verification or where they raise a question as to the interpretation of
this Protocol, they shall be submitted to the Special Committee on Customs Cooperation and Trade
Facilitation.

In  all  cases  the  settlement  of  disputes  between  the  importer  and  the  customs  authorities  of  the
importing country shall take place under the legislation of that country.

ARTICLE 37

Penalties

Penalties  shall  be  imposed  on  any  person  who  draws  up,  or  causes  to  be  drawn  up,  a  document
which  contains  incorrect  information  for  the  purpose  of  obtaining  a  preferential  treatment  for
products.

ARTICLE 38

Free zones

1. The CARIFORUM States and the EC Party shall take all necessary steps to ensure that products
traded  under  cover  of  a  proof  of  origin  or  a  supplier’s  declaration  and  which  in  the  course  of
transport  use  a  free  zone  situated  in  their  territory,  are  not  substituted  by  other  goods  and  do  not
undergo handling other than normal operations designed to prevent their deterioration.

2. By means of an exemption to the provisions contained in paragraph 1, when originating products
are imported into a free zone under cover of a proof of origin and undergo treatment or processing,
the authorities concerned shall issue a new movement certificate EUR.1 at the exporter’s request, if
the treatment or processing undergone complies with the provisions of this Protocol.

195

ARTICLE 39

Derogations

1.  Derogations  from  this  Protocol  may  be  adopted  by  the  Special  Committee  on  Customs
Cooperation  and  Trade  Facilitation,  hereafter  in  this  Article  referred  to  as  "the  Committee",  in
favour of products exported from the CARIFORUM States.

2. Derogations from this Protocol may be adopted where the development of existing industries or
the creation of new industries in the CARIFORUM States justifies the adoption of such derogations.

3.  The  CARIFORUM  State  or  States  concerned  shall,  either  before  or  when  the  request  for
derogation  is  submitted  to  the  Committee,  notify  the  EC  Party  of  its  request  for  a  derogation
together with the reasons for the request in accordance with paragraph 5.

4.  The  EC  Party  shall  respond  positively  to  all  the  CARIFORUM  States'  requests  which  are  duly
justified in conformity with this Article and which cannot cause serious injury to an established EC
Party industry.

5.  In  order  to  facilitate  the  examination  by  the  Committee  of  requests  for  derogation,  the
CARIFORUM State or States making the request shall, by means of the form given in Annex VII to
this  Protocol,  furnish  in  support  of  their  request  the  fullest  possible  information  covering  in
particular the following:

– description of the finished product,

– nature and quantity of materials originating in third countries,

– nature and quantity of materials originating in CARIFORUM States or the countries or territories
referred  to  in  Articles  3  and  4,  or  the  materials  which  have  been  processed  in  these  countries  or
territories,

– manufacturing processes,

– added value achieved,

– number of employees in the enterprise concerned,

– anticipated volume of exports to the EC Party,

– other possible sources of supply for raw materials,

– reasons for the duration requested in the light of efforts made to find new sources of supply,

– other observations.

The Committee may modify the form.

6. The examination of requests for derogation shall in particular take into account:

196

(a)  the  level  of  development  or  the  geographical  situation  of  the  CARIFORUM  State  or  States
concerned;

(b) cases where the application of the existing rules of origin would significantly affect the ability of
an  existing  industry  in  a  CARIFORUM  State  or  States  to  continue  their  exports  to  the  EC  Party,
with particular reference to cases where this could lead to cessation of its activities;

(c)  specific  cases  where  it  can  be  clearly  demonstrated  that  significant  investment  in  an  industry
could  be  deterred  by  the  rules  of  origin  and  where  a  derogation  favouring  the  realization  of  the
investment programme would enable these rules to be satisfied by stages.

7. In every case an examination shall be made to ascertain whether the rules relating to cumulation
of origin do not provide a solution to the problem.

8. The Committee shall take steps necessary to ensure that a decision on a request for derogation is
reached  as  soon  as  possible  and,  in  any  case,  not  later  than  seventy-five  working  days  after  the
request is received by the EC Party. If the EC Party does not inform the CARIFORUM State of its
position on the request within this period, the request shall be deemed to have been accepted.

(a) The derogation shall be valid for a period, generally of five years, to be determined by the

9.
Committee.

(b)  The  derogation  decision  may  provide  for  renewals  without  a  new  decision  of  the
Committee  being  necessary,  provided  that  the  CARIFORUM  State  or  States  concerned  submit,
three months before the end of each period, proof that they are still unable to meet the conditions of
this Protocol which have been derogated from.

If any objection is made to the extension, the Committee shall examine it as soon as possible and
decide  whether  to  prolong  the  derogation.  The  Committee  shall  proceed  as  provided  for  in
paragraph 8. All necessary measures shall be taken to avoid interruptions in the application of the
derogation.

(c)  In  the  periods  referred  to  in  subparagraphs  (a)  and  (b),  the  Committee  may  review  the
terms for implementing the derogation should a significant change be found to have taken place in
the substantive factors governing the decision to grant the derogation. On conclusion of its review
the Committee may decide to amend the terms of its decision as regards the scope of derogation or
any other condition previously laid down.

CARIFORUM State.

4.  Working  or  processing  carried  out  in  Ceuta,  Melilla  or  in  the  EC  Party  shall  be  considered  as

Annexes

199

ANNEX I TO PROTOCOL I

## Introductory notes to the list in Annex II1

Note 1:

The list sets out the conditions required for all products to be considered as sufficiently worked or
processed within the meaning of Article 7 of the Protocol.

Note 2:

1.

The  first  two  columns  in  the  list  describe  the  product  obtained.    The  first  column  gives  the
heading  number  or  chapter  number  used  in  the  Harmonized  System  and  the  second  column
gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter.  For each entry
in the first two columns a rule is specified in columns 3 or 4.  Where, in some cases, the entry
in the first column is preceded by an "ex", this signifies that the rules in columns 3 or 4 apply
only to the part of that heading as described in column 2.

2.  Where  several  heading  numbers  are  grouped  together  in  column  1  or  a  chapter  number  is
given  and  the  description  of  products  in  column 2  is  therefore  given  in  general  terms,  the
adjacent rules in columns 3 or 4 apply to all products which, under the Harmonized System,
are  classified  in  headings  of  the  chapter  or  in  any  of  the  headings  grouped  together  in
column 1.

3.  Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each
indent  contains  the  description  of  that  part  of  the  heading  covered  by  the  adjacent  rules  in
columns 3 or 4.

4.  Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3 and 4, the
exporter may opt, as an alternative, to apply either the rule set out in column 3 or that set out
in  column 4.    If  no  origin  rule  is  given  in  column 4,  the  rule  set  out  in  column 3  has  to  be
applied.

Note 3:

1.

The  provisions  of  Article  7  of  the  Protocol  concerning products having acquired originating
status  which  are  used  in  the  manufacture  of  other  products  apply  regardless  of  whether  this
status has been acquired inside the factory where these products are used or in another factory
in the EC Party or in the CARIFORUM States.

Example:

An engine of heading No 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating
materials  which  may  be  incorporated  may  not  exceed  40 per  cent  of  the  ex-works  price,  is
made from "other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging" of heading No ex 7224.

If  this  forging  has  been  forged  in  the  EC  Party  from  a  non-originating  ingot,  it  has  already
acquired  originating  status  by  virtue  of  the  rule  for  heading  No  ex  7224  in  the  list.    The

1 All examples are given for the purpose of explanation only. They are not legally binding.

200

forging  can  then  count  as  originating  in  the  value  calculation  for  the  engine  regardless  of
whether it was produced in the same factory or in another factory in the EC Party.  The value
of  the  non-originating  ingot  is  thus  not  taken  into  account  when  adding  up  the  value  of  the
non-originating materials used.

2.

The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required and the
carrying  out  of  more  working  or  processing  also  confers  originating  status;  conversely,  the
carrying out of less working or processing cannot confer originating status. Therefore, if a rule
provides that non-originating material at a certain level of manufacture may be used, the use
of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed and the use of such material at a
later stage is not.

3.  Without prejudice to Note 3.2 where a rule states that "materials of any heading" may be used,
materials  of  the  same  heading  as  the  product  may  also  be  used,  subject,  however,  to  any
specific  limitations  which  may  also  be  contained  in  the  rule.  However,  the  expression
"manufacture  from  materials  of  any  heading,  including  other  materials  of  heading  No  ..."
means  that  only  materials  classified  in  the  same  heading  as  the  product  of  a  different
description than that of the product as given in column 2 of the list may be used.

4.  When  a  rule  in  the  list  specifies  that  a  product  may  be  manufactured  from  more  than  one
material, this means that any one or more materials may be used.  It does not require that all
be used.

Example:

The rule for fabrics of heading Nos 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may be used and
that  chemical  materials,  among  other  materials,  may  also  be  used.   This  does  not  mean  that
both have to be used; it is possible to use one or the other or both.

5.  Where  a  rule  in  the  list  specifies  that  a  product  must  be  manufactured  from  a  particular
material, the condition obviously does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of
their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule.  (See also Note 6.3 below in relation to textiles).

Example:

The rule for prepared foods of heading No 1904 which specifically excludes the use of cereals
and their derivatives does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives
which are not products from cereals.

However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured from
the  particular  materials  specified  in  the  list,  can  be  produced  from  a  material  of  the  same
nature at an earlier stage of manufacture.

Example:

In  the  case  of  an  article  of  apparel  of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven materials, if the
use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible to start
from  non-woven  cloth  – even  if  non-woven  cloth  cannot  normally  be  made  from  yarn.    In
such cases, the starting material would normally be at the stage before yarn – that is the fibre
stage.

6.  Where,  in  a  rule  in  the  list,  two  percentages  are  given  for  the  maximum  value  of
non-originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be added together.
In  other  words,  the  maximum  value  of  all  the  non-originating  materials  used  may  never
exceed the highest of the percentages given.  Furthermore, the individual percentages must not
be exceeded in relation to the particular materials they apply to.

The term "natural fibres" is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic
fibres.  It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless
otherwise specified, includes fibres that have been carded, combed or otherwise processed but
not spun.

The  term  "natural  fibres"  includes horsehair of heading No 0503, silk of heading Nos  5002
and 5003 as well as the wool fibres, fine or coarse animal hair of heading Nos  5101 to 5105,
the cotton fibres of heading Nos 5201 to 5203 and the other vegetable fibres of heading Nos
5301 to 5305.

The  terms  "textile  pulp", "chemical  materials"  and  "paper-making materials" are used in the
list  to  describe  the  materials  not  classified  in  Chapters  50  to  63,  which  can  be  used  to
manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.

The term "man-made staple fibres" is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament
tow, staple fibres or waste, of heading Nos  5501 to 5507.

Note 5:

1.  Where for a given product in the list a reference is made to this note, the conditions set out in
column  3  shall  not  be  applied  to any basic textile materials, used in the manufacture of this
product, which, taken together, represent 10 per cent or less of the total weight of all the basic
textile materials used.  (See also Notes 5.3 and 5.4 below).

2.  However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may only be applied to mixed products which

have been made from two or more basic textile materials.

The following are the basic textile materials:
I.             silk,
wool,
II.
coarse animal hair,
III.
fine animal hair,
IV.
horsehair,
V.
cotton,
VI.

XXVII.  yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether whether or

artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,

not gimped,

XXVIII. yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester whether or

not gimped,

XXIX.  products  of  heading  No  5605  (metallized  yarn)  incorporating  strip  consisting  of  a
core  of  aluminium  foil  or  of  a  core  of  plastic  film  whether  or  not  coated  with
aluminium  powder,  of  a  width  not  exceeding  5  mm,  sandwiched  by  means  of  a
transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film,

XXX.  other products of heading No 5605.

Example:

A yarn of heading No 5205 made from cotton fibres of heading No 5203 and synthetic staple
fibres of heading No 5506 is a mixed yarn.  Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres
that do not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or
textile pulp) may be used up to a weight of 10 per cent of the yarn.

Example:

A  woollen  fabric  of  heading  No  5112  made  from  woollen  yarn  of  heading  No  5107  and
synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading No 5509 is a mixed fabric.  Therefore synthetic yarn
which does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or
textile pulp) or woollen yarn that does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture
from  natural  fibres,  not  carded  or  combed  or  otherwise  prepared  for  spinning)  or  a
combination of the two may be used provided their total weight does not exceed 10 per cent of
the weight of the fabric.

Example:

Tufted  textile  fabric  of  heading  No  5802  made  from  cotton  yarn  of  heading  No 5205  and
cotton fabric of heading No 5210 is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed
fabric being made from yarns classified in two separate headings or if the cotton yarns used
are themselves mixtures.

Example:

If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading No 5205 and
synthetic  fabric  of  heading  No  5407,  then,  obviously,  the  yarns  used  are  two  separate  basic
textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is accordingly a mixed product.

203

3.

4.

In  the  case  of  products  incorporating  "yarn  made  of  polyurethane  segmented  with  flexible
segments of polyether whether or not gimped" this tolerance is 20 per cent in respect of this
yarn.

In the case of products incorporating "strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core
of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm,
sandwiched by means of an adhesive between two layers of plastic film", this tolerance is 30
per cent in respect of this strip.

Note 6:

1.

In the case of those textile products, which are marked in the list by a footnote referring to this
Introductory  Note, textile  trimmings  and  accessories  which  do  not  satisfy  the  rule  set  out in
the  list  in  column  3  for  the  made  up  products  concerned  may  be  used  provided  that  their
weight does not exceed 10% of the total weight of all the textile materials incorporated.

Textile  trimmings  and  accessories  are  those  classified  in  Chapters  50  to  63.  Linings  and
interlinings are not be regarded as trimmings or accessories.

2.  Any  non-textile trimmings and accessories or other materials used which contain textiles do
not have to satisfy the conditions set out in column 3 even though they fall outside the scope
of Note 3.5.

3.

In  accordance  with  Note  3.5,  any  non-originating  non-textile  trimmings  and  accessories  or
other  product,  which  do  not  contain  any  textiles,  may,  anyway,  be  used  freely  where  they
cannot be made from the materials listed in column 3.

XXXI.  For  example,  if  a  rule  in  the  list  says  that  for  a  particular  textile  item,  such  as  a
blouse, yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons,
because they cannot be made from textile materials.

4.  Where  a  percentage  rule  applies,  the  value  of  trimmings  and  accessories  must  be  taken  into

account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.

Note 7:

1.

For the purposes of heading Nos ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403, the
"specific processes" are the following:

(a)

in respect of heavy oils falling within heading No ex 2710 only, desulphurization with
hydrogen  resulting  in  a  reduction  of  at  least  85  per  cent  of  the  sulphur  content  of  the
products processed (ASTM D 1266-59 T method);

(k)

in respect of products falling within heading No 2710 only, deparaffining by a process
other than filtering;

(l)

in  respect  of  heavy  oils  falling  within  heading  No  ex  2710  only,  treatment  with
hydrogen at a pressure of more than 20 bar and a temperature of more than 250° C with
the  use  of  a  catalyst,  other  than  to  effect  desulphurization,  when  the  hydrogen
constitutes  an  active  element  in  a  chemical  reaction.    The  further  treatment  with
hydrogen  of
lubricating  oils  of  heading  No  ex 2710  (e.g. hydrofinishing  or
decolorization)  in  order,  more  especially,  to  improve  colour  or  stability  shall  not,
however, be deemed to be a specific process;

205

(m)

in respect of fuel oils falling within heading No ex 2710 only, atmospheric distillation,
on  condition  that  less  than  30  per  cent  of  these  products  distils,  by  volume,  including
losses, at 300°C by the ASTM D 86 method;

(n)

in  respect  of  heavy  oils  other  than  gas  oils  and  fuel  oils  falling  within  heading
No ex 2710 only, treatment by means of a high-frequency electrical brush-discharge.

3.  For  the  purposes  of  heading  Nos  ex  2707,  2713  to  2715,  ex  2901,  ex  2902  and  ex 3403,
simple  operations  such  as  cleaning,  decanting,  desalting,  water  separation,  filtering,
colouring, marking, obtaining a sulphur content as a result of mixing products with different
sulphur  contents,  any  combination  of  these  operations  or  like  operations  do  not  confer
origin.

JOINT DECLARATION RELATING TO PROTOCOL I ON THE ORIGIN OF
FISHERY PRODUCTS

The  EC  Party  acknowledges  the  right  of  the  coastal  CARIFORUM  States  to  the
development and rational exploitation  of the fishery resources in all waters within their
jurisdiction.

The  Parties  agree  that  the  existing  rules  of  origin  have  to  be  examined  in  order  to
determine what possible changes may have to be made in the light of the first paragraph.

Conscious of their respective concerns and interests, the CARIFORUM States and the EC
Party  agree  to  continue  examining  the  problem  posed  by  the  entry,  onto  EC  Party
markets,  of  the  fishery  products  from  catches  made  in  zones  within  the  national
jurisdiction of the CARIFORUM states, with a view to arriving at a solution satisfactory
to  both  sides.  This  examination  shall  take  place  in  the  Special  Committee  on  Customs
Cooperation and Trade Facilitation.

DECLARATION OF THE CARIFORUM STATES RELATING
TO PROTOCOL I ON THE ORIGIN OF FISHERY PRODUCTS FROM THE
EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC ZONE

The  CARIFORUM    States  reaffirm  the  point  of  view  they  expressed  throughout  the
negotiations  on rules of origin in respect of fishery products and consequently maintain
that following the exercise of their sovereign rights over fishery resources in the waters
within their national jurisdiction, including the Exclusive Economic Zone, as defined in
the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, all catches effected in those waters
obligatorily landed in the  ports of the CARIFORUM states for processing should enjoy
originating status.

JOINT DECLARATION RELATING
# TO PROTOCOL I CONCERNING THE PRINCIPALITY OF ANDORRA AND
THE REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO

1.  Products originating in the Principality of Andorra falling within Chapters 25 to 97 of
the Harmonised System and products originating in the Republic of San Marino shall be
accepted by the CARIFORUM States as originating in the European Community within
the meaning of this Agreement.

2.  Protocol  1  shall  apply  mutatis  mutandis  for  the  purpose  of  defining  the  originating
status of the above-mentioned products.

1.
proceed,  within  the  limits  of  its  competence  and  available  resources,  as  though  it were
acting  on  its  own  account  or  at  the  request  of  other  authorities  of  that  same  Party  or
Signatory  CARIFORUM  State,  by  supplying  information  already  in  its  possession,  by
carrying  out  appropriate  enquiries  or  by  arranging  for  them  to  be  carried  out.  This
provision shall also apply to any other authority to which the request has been addressed
by the requested authority when the latter cannot act on its own.

Requests  for  assistance  shall  be  executed  in  accordance  with  the  legal  or

2.
regulatory provisions of the requested Party or Signatory CARIFORUM State.

latter, be present to obtain in the offices of the requested authority or any other concerned
authority  in  accordance  with  paragraph  1,  information  relating  to  activities  that  are  or

Article 9

Exceptions to the obligation to provide assistance

Assistance  may  be  refused  or  may  be  subject  to  the  satisfaction  of  certain
conditions  or  requirements,  in  cases  where  a  Signatory  CARIFORUM  State  or  the  EC
Party is of the opinion that assistance under this Protocol would:

(a) be likely to prejudice the sovereignty of a Signatory CARIFORUM State or that of a
Member  State  of  the  European  Community  which  has  been  requested  to  provide
assistance under this Protocol; or

(b) be likely to prejudice public policy, security or other essential interests, in particular

CARIFORUM State which may receive them undertakes to protect such data in at least
an  equivalent  way  to  the  one  applicable  to  that  particular  case  in  the  Party  or  the
Signatory  CARIFORUM  State  that  may  supply  them.  To  that  end,  parties  shall
communicate  to  each  other  information  on  their  applicable  rules,  including,  where

The  competent  authority  which  supplied  that  information  or  gave  access  to  those
documents shall be notified of such use.

Information obtained shall be used solely for the purposes of this Protocol. Where
4.
one  of the Parties or  Signatory CARIFORUM State wishes to use such information for
other purposes, it  shall obtain the prior written consent of the authority which provided
the  information.  Such  use  shall  then  be  subject  to  any  restrictions  laid  down  by  that
authority.

qualification the official will be questioned.

reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant to this Protocol, except, as appropriate, for
expenses  to experts and witnesses, and those to interpreters and translators who are not
public service employees.

Implementation

The  implementation  of  this  Protocol  shall  be  entrusted  on  the  one  hand  to  the

341

competent  services  of  the  Commission  of  the  European  Communities  and  the  customs
authorities of the Member States of the European Union as appropriate. They shall decide
on  all  practical  measures  and  arrangements  necessary  for  its  application,  taking  into
consideration  the  rules  in  force  in  particular  in  the  field  of  data  protection.  They  may
recommend to the competent bodies amendments which they consider should be made to
this Protocol.

2.
The Parties and the Signatory CARIFORUM States shall consult each other and
subsequently keep each other informed of the detailed rules of implementation which are
adopted in accordance with the provisions of this Protocol.

Article 14

Other agreements

Taking into account the respective competences of the European Community and

1.
the Member States of the European Union, the provisions of this Protocol shall:

not  affect  the  obligations  of  the  Parties  and  the  Signatory  CARIFORUM  States

under any other international Agreement or Convention,

##### (b)
be deemed complementary to Agreements on mutual assistance which have been
or may be concluded between individual Member States of the European Community and

governing the communication between the competent services of the Commission of the
European  Communities  and  the  customs  authorities  of  the  Member  States  of  the
European Community of any information obtained under this Protocol which could be of
interest to the European Community.

3.
Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  paragraph  1,  the  provisions  of  this  Protocol
shall take precedence over the provisions of any bilateral Agreement on mutual assistance
which has been or may be concluded between individual Member States of the European
Community  and  any  Signatory  CARIFORUM  State  in  so  far  as  the  provisions  of  the
latter are incompatible with those of this Protocol.

4.
In  respect  of  questions  relating  to  the  applicability  of  this  Protocol,  the  Parties
shall consult each other to resolve the matter in the framework of the Special Committee
on  Customs  Cooperation  and  Trade  Facilitation  set  up  under  Article  36  of  the
CARIFORUM-EC Economic Partnership Agreement.

348

JOINT DECLARATION ON DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION

The Parties recognize the important adjustment challenges that the implementation of this
Agreement will pose, in particular to smaller economies among the CARIFORUM States.
The  Parties  agree  that  an  important  number  of  commitments  undertaken  in  this
Agreement  will  require  the  rapid  start  of  reforms.  The  Parties  also  recognize  regional
infrastructure  as  an  important  tool  to  enable  the  CARIFORUM  States  to  take  full
advantage of the opportunities offered by this Agreement.

The  Parties  reaffirm  the  importance  of  ensuring  the  most  efficient  use  of  development
finance  resources,  in  order  to  meet  the  objectives  of  this  Agreement,  to  maximize  its
potential  and  support  its  proper  implementation,  as  well  as  to  support  the  CARICOM
Development Vision.

## The  Parties  note  the  availability  of  €165  Million  for financing  the  10th  EDF Caribbean
#### Regional  Indicative  Programme  (CRIP)  and  recall  that  under  the  Revised  Cotonou Agreement,  a  successor  to  the  current  Financial  Protocol  will  be  agreed  for  the  period 2014  –  2020.  The  Parties  further  recognize  that  the  funds  allocated  to  the  Caribbean
## Regional Indicative Programme (CRIP) in the 10th EDF are to be complemented by Aid
for Trade contributions by Member States of the European Union (EU).

Pursuant to both the EU Aid for Trade Strategy adopted in October 2007 and the funding
instruments enumerated in Article 7 of Part I of this Agreement, the Member States of the
European  Union  confirm  their  intention  to  ensure  that  an  equitable  share  of  Member
States’ Aid for Trade commitments will benefit the Caribbean ACP States, including for
funding programmes related to the implementation of this Agreement.

The  Parties  agree  on  the  benefits  of  regional  development  mechanisms,  including  a
regional  development  fund,  accessible  to  all  CARIFORUM  States,  to  mobilize  and
channel  Economic  Partnership  Agreement  related  development  resources  from  the
European  Union  and  other  potential  donors.  In  this  respect,  the  European  Commission
and the Member States of the European Union will consider the necessary arrangements
with  the  CARICOM  Development  Fund,  once  established,  with  a  view  to  providing  to
the Fund resources to support the execution of programmes related to the implementation
of  this  Agreement,  as  well  as  to  support  related  adjustment  measures  and  economic
reforms.  The  EU  contribution  would  complement  the  contribution  that  will  have  been
made by the Caribbean States and other donors.

The  Parties  agree  that  addressing  CARIFORUM’s  most  immediate  development
cooperation  priorities,  related  to  the  implementation  of  this  Agreement,  would  be
accorded  high  priority  in  the  programming  of  resources,  notably,  those  made  available
## under the 10th EDF

JOINT DECLARATION ON BANANAS

The  Parties  recognize  the  importance  of  bananas  to  the  economic  development  of  a
number of CARIFORUM countries in terms of employment, foreign exchange and social
and political stability.

349

They similarly recognize that CARIFORUM banana exports to the EU have been helped
in the past by a substantial tariff preference and that the maintenance of such preference
for as long as possible would increase the benefits resulting from this Agreement.

The CARIFORUM States also consider that the possible reduction of the MFN tariff and
the  implementation  of  Free  Trade  Agreements  between  the  EC  Party  and  certain  third
countries  would  pose  significant  competitive  challenges  for  the  banana  industry  in
several CARIFORUM countries.

Within  the  framework  of  European  Community  funding  instruments,  both  Parties  will
decide on the programming of funds, in complementarity  to the actions already funded,
and with respect to the still available funds under the Special Framework of Assistance
(SFA), to help the CARIFORUM banana industry to further adjust to the new challenges,
including activities aimed at increasing the productivity and competitiveness in areas of
viable  production,  the  development  of  alternatives  both  within  and  outside  the  banana
industry,  addressing  social  impact  arising  from  changes  in  the  sector  and  for  disaster
mitigation.

JOINT DECLARATION ON USED GOODS

With regard to the controls on the importation of motor vehicles and motorcycles older
than five years, and vehicles greater or equal to five tons older than 15 years, pursuant to
Dominican Republic Law No. 147 of 27 December 2000 the EC Party undertakes not to
challenge this law irrespective of the question of its compatibility with the Agreement.

JOINT DECLARATION ON RICE

The  Parties  commit  to  ensuring  that  the  licensing  and  other  arrangements  for  the
administration of the tariff rate quota for rice, referred to in paragraph 2 of Annex 1, are
kept under detailed review with a view to ensuring that the CARIFORUM rice exporting
States obtain the maximum benefits of this Agreement.

JOINT DECLARATION ON REALLOCATION OF UNDELIVERED
QUANTITIES UNDER THE SUGAR PROTOCOL

The  EC  Party and  the Signatory CARIFORUM States party to the Sugar Protocol shall
seek  to reallocate until  30 September 2009 any undelivered quantities from such States
amongst  other  CARIFORUM States party to the Sugar Protocol to the extent permitted
by Article 7 of the Protocol.

THIRD SCHEDULE

(Section  4)

APPENDIX 1

ANNEX III OF THE AGREEMENT

INTERPRETATING THE SCHEDULE OF TARIFF LIBERALIZATION OF THE
CARIFORUM STATES

Introductory Note.

Note I

1) In international trade, the tariff charged for the importation of a good depends on
the type of good and how it is classified.  To prevent disputes arising from confusion
about the classification of goods and the tariff applied, a transparent and predictable
harmonized system of classification is used.  This system, known as the Harmonized
Commodity Description and Coding System (HS) was developed by members of the
World Customs Organisation.  The classification of the goods used in the schedule
of tariff liberalization of the CARIFORUM states is based on the HS System.

The EPA CARIFORUM SCHEDULE

2) The  CARIFORUM  Schedule  of  tariffs  for  the  liberization  of  trade  in  goods
contains three elements characterising the schedule which should be considered.
These elements are as follows:

1) A  product-by-product  treatment  for  imports  from  the  EU,  that  is,  the
reduction of tariffs overtime is formulated for each individual product.  Some
products  may  be  excluded  from  liberalization  (denoted  as  "Excl"  in  the
schedule), which allows a country to continue to apply the current tariffs
indefinitely.  On the other hand, the tariffs of other products will be reduced
in phases, whereby the current tariff of each of those products will eventually
be reduced to zero over a given number of years (either immediate-duty-free
or elimination in phases of 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 years).

2) For products which will be liberalized, the EPA provides for:

a)

A moratorium on reductions where in no tariff reductions will take place
- three years from the year of provisional application (2008) for all
goods, apart from motor vehicles and their parts and gasoline which
will enjoy a ten-year moratorium.

######### THE LAWS OF BARBADOS Printed by the Government Printer, Bay Street, St. Michael by the authority of the Government of Barbados

352

b)

A 'harmonized" rate applicable across the region, which is reduced
over a certain period of time.  The harmonized rate is formulated on the
basis of each CARIFORUM Member State's Applied rather than Bound
Tariffs for each product.  Bound Tariffs, particularly in the World Trade
Organization (WTO) context, are those which a country has committed
not to increase beyond a specific level.  Once a tariff has been bound,
it can only be raised if all affected parties are suitably compensated.  On
the other hand, applied rates are those that are actually applied by the
country concerned which may be equal to the bound rate but may not
exceed the bound rate.  Countries with applied rates lower than the
harmonized rate do not need to provide for this higher rate, rather they
can begin liberalization when at the 'harmonised" rate is equal to their
national rate.  The EPA schedule does not reflect the national applied
rates.

3) Country  Specific  Exceptions  (whereby  certain  Member  States  can  either
immediately reduce tariffs to zero or maintain tariff rates exceeding the harmonized
rate, although these must also be phased out over a certain period of time.  Barbados
is  included  among  a  group  of  signatory  CARIFORUM  States  falling  within  this
category.

Note II

1) The first two columns list goods which are duty free and identified by "0", (zero
rate of duty) on goods imported into CARIFORUM States from the EC or subject to:

a)

b)

phased reduction of the most favoured nation (MFN) rate of duty for
the period 2009 through 2033, within the meaning of Article 16.1, 16.2
and 16.3, respectively of the Agreement;

the list of goods excluded from the phased reduction time table, which
would be subject to the application of the MFN Rate of Duty; and

c)

the list of other goods subject to the MFN Rate of Duty.

2) Also included in the column number 1 (CET HS2007) is the list of country Specific
Exemptions, whereby certain member states can either immediately reduce tariff to
zero or maintain tariff rates exceeding the harmonized rate, although these must be
phased out over a certain period of time.  Example Tariff-sub-heading 0207.13.00 Ex.
 The "Ex" identifies such products.

3) The first column list the sub-heading number used in the Harmonized System (HS)
up to the eight digit levels.  The second column specifies the product description for
each sub-heading while the third specifies the treatment to be applied to imports over
a period of 25 years.

353

4) The third, fourth and fifth columns specifies, respectively, (i) the EPA Treatment
to be applied to imports under any specific Tariff heading over a maximum of twenty-
five years, (2) the Common External Tariff (CET) Rate of duty applicable to each tariff
heading on imports from the EC starting from the base year of 2007; and (3) the
applied CET rate of duty for each tariff heading from the base period of 2004 to 2008.

5) The columns numbered 6 through 22 represent the liberalized time frames from 1st
January, 2009 through 1st January, 2033 up to 25 years.  The tariff treatment in these
columns is reflected by the rates of duty expressed as percentages to be applied
against the good overtime (2009 through 2033).  The values in the row correspond to
particular timeframes expressed in the columns at the top of the page.  These timeframes
are expressed in ascending order in two year intervals starting from the year 2009 and
ending with the year 2033.

6) The  value  in  the  row  must  be  checked  against  the  corresponding  timeframe.
Therefore, the very first value in the row reflects the duty that will be applied to the
good from 1st January, 2009.  The second value reflects the duty to be applied from the
1st January, 2011 etc.  The duties to be applied will gradually decline to zero overtime.
Values  expressed  as  zero  (0)  mean  that  the  item  is  duty  free  upon  entering
CARIFORUM.  The bolded term "Excl" in the column EPA Treatment is used to
express  that  CARIFORUM  States  have  excluded  this  item  from  liberalization
indefinitely.

7) It should also be noted that some CARIFORUM States are allowed to reduce
tariffs to zero immediately or may choose to maintain higher-than-the-maximum
tariffs on specific goods.  Such allowances are referred to as "Exceptions", and are
noted  in  the  HS  CET  column  by  abbreviation  "Ex"  following  the  particular  HS
sub-heading number.  Example HS sub-heading number 0207.13.00 Ex Offal fresh or
chilled.
