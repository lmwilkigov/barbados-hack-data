ENACTED by the Parliament of Barbados in accordance with section 49 of

the Constitution as follows:

4

Short title

1.
2020.

This Act may be cited as the Severance Payments (Amendment) Act,

Application of Act

The  amendments  herein  made  to  the  Severance  Payments  Act,
2.
Cap. 355A, are in consequence of the public health emergency declared by the
Proclamation made by the Governor General on 28th day of March, 2020.

Amendment of the Severance Payments Act, Cap. 355A

The Severance Payments Act, Cap. 355A, in this Act referred to as
3.
the  principal  Act,  is  amended  by  inserting  immediately  after  section  6  the
following new sections:

“Temporary right to severance payment for lay-off or short-
time

6A.(1)

Where an employee has been laid off or kept on short-time

(a)

commencing at any time between the 1st day of March, 2020
and  the  30th  day  of  April,  2020  that  employee  will  not  be
entitled to claim severance payment, unless he had been laid
off or kept on short-time for 22 consecutive weeks; or

(b)

for a series of 18 or more weeks within a period of 24 weeks,

then,  if  the  employee,  within  4  weeks  after  the  relevant  date,  gives
notice in writing to his employer indicating (in whatsoever terms) his
intention to claim a severance payment in respect of the lay-off or short-
time (in this section and section 7 referred to as "a notice of intention
to claim") the employee is, subject to this section, entitled to a severance
payment for being laid off or kept on short-time.

5

Where an employee had been laid off or kept on short-time before

(2)
the 1st day of June, 2020 as a result of

(a)

(b)

the restrictions on international travel due to the declaration
of a public health emergency; and

the  consequent  restriction  in  the  operation  of  business
imposed  by  the  making  of  the  Emergency  Management
(Covid-19) Curfew (Nos. 1-5) Directives, 2020

that employee shall not be entitled to claim severance, unless he had
been laid off or kept on short-time for 22 consecutive weeks or for a
series of 18 or more weeks within a period of 24 weeks.

For the purposes of this section“the relevant date” in relation to
(3)
a notice of intention to claim the right to a severance payment pursuant
to such notice means the date on which the last of the 22 consecutive
weeks or the series of 18 or more weeks referred in subsection (2), as
the case may be, came to an end.

(4)

Where an employee has given notice of intention to claim

(a)

(b)

he is not entitled to a severance payment in pursuance of that
notice unless he terminated his contract of employment by a
week's notice which (whether given before or after or at the
same time as the notice of intention to claim) is given before
the  end  of  the  period  allowed  for  the  purposes  of  this
paragraph (as specified in subsection (5) of section 7); and

he is not entitled to a severance payment in pursuance of the
notice of intention to claim if he is dismissed by his employer
(but without prejudice to any right to a severance payment
because of the dismissal).

If an employee is required by his contract of employment to give
(5)
more than a week's notice to terminate the contract, the reference in
paragraph (a) of subsection (4) to a week's notice shall be construed as
a reference to the minimum notice which is so required to give.

6

(6)
Subject  to  subsection  (7),  an  employee  is  not  entitled  to  a
severance payment in pursuance of a notice of intention to claim if, on
the date of service of that notice, it was reasonably to be expected that
the employee (if he continued to be employed by the same employer)
would, not later than 4 weeks after that date, enter upon a period of
employment of not less than 24 weeks during which he would not be
laid off or kept on short-time for any week.

Subsection  (6)  shall  not  apply  unless,  within  7  days  after  the
(7)
service of the notice of intention to claim, the employer gives to the
employee  notice  in  writing  (in  section  7  referred  to  as  a  "counter-
notice")  that  he  will  contest  any  liability  to  pay  to  him  a  severance
payment in pursuance of the notice of intention to claim.

For the purposes of this section and section 7, "week" in relation
(8)
to an employee whose remuneration is calculated weekly by a week
ending on a day other than Saturday, means a week ending on that other
day, and, in relation to any other employee, means a week ending with
Saturday.

The  Minister  may  by  order  prescribe  the  procedure  for

Amendment of Cap. 355A

4.
7 the following new section:

The principal Act is amended by inserting immediately after section

“Temporary supplementary provisions as to severance
payments in respect of lay-off or short-time

7A.(1)
Where, in a case where an employee gives notice of intention
to  claim  and  the  employer  gives  a  counter-notice,  the  employee

7

continues or has continued, during the next 4 weeks after the date of
service of the notice of intention to claim, to be employed by the same
employer, and he is or has been laid off or kept on short-time for each
of those weeks, it shall be conclusively presumed that the condition
specified in subsection (6) of section 6A was not fulfilled.

For  the  purposes  of  section  6A(1)  and  subsection  (1),  it  is
(2)
immaterial whether the 22 consecutive weeks referred to in paragraph
(a) of section 6A(1) or the series of 18 or more weeks referred to in
paragraph  (b)  of  that  section  consist  wholly  of  weeks  for  which  the
employee is laid off or wholly of weeks for which he is kept on short-
time or partly of one and partly of the other.

For the purposes mentioned in subsection (2), no account shall
(3)
be taken of any week for which an employee is laid off or kept on short-
time where the lay-off or short-time is wholly or mainly attributable to
a strike or a lock-out, whether the strike or lock-out is in the trade or
industry in which the employee is employed or not and whether it is in
Barbados or elsewhere.

Where the employer gives a counter-notice within 7 days after
(4)
the service of a notice of intention to claim and does not withdraw the
counter-notice by a subsequent notice in writing, the employee shall
not be entitled to a severance payment in pursuance of the notice of
intention to claim except in accordance with a decision of a tribunal.

The  period  allowed  for  the  purposes  of  paragraph  (a)  of

(5)
subsection (4) of section 6A is as follows, that is to say

(a)

(b)

if the employer does not give a counter-notice within 7 days
after the service of the notice of intention to claim, that period
is 3 weeks after the end of those 7 days;

if the employer gives a counter-notice within those 7 days,
but withdraws it by a subsequent notice in writing, that period
is 3 weeks after the service of the notice of withdrawal;

8

(c)

if the employer gives a counter-notice within those 7 days
and does not so withdraw it and a question as to the right of
the  employee  to  a  severance  payment  in  pursuance  of  the
notice of intention to claim is referred to a tribunal, that period
is 3 weeks after the tribunal has notified to the employee its
decision on that reference.

For the purposes of paragraph (c) of subsection (5), no account
(6)
shall be taken of any appeal against the decision of the tribunal or of
any proceedings or decision in consequence of such an appeal.”.

Amendment of Fifth Schedule to Cap. 355A

5.
immediately after paragraph 7 the following new paragraph:

The  Fifth  Schedule  to  the  principal  Act  is  amended  by  inserting

“7A.
Where the employee has before the death of the deceased
employer been laid off or kept on short-time for one or more weeks,
but has not given to the deceased employer notice of intention to claim,
then if after the death of the deceased employer

(a)

(b)

his contract of employment is renewed, or he is re-engaged
under a new contract, as mentioned in sub-paragraphs (a) and
(b) of paragraph 3; and

after the renewal or re-engagement, he is laid off or kept on
short-time  for  one  or  more  weeks  by  the  personal
representative of the deceased employer,

sections 6A and 7A shall apply as if the week in which the deceased
employer died and the first week of the employee’s employment by the
personal representative were consecutive weeks, and any reference in
those sections, except in subsection (6) of section 6A, to 22 weeks or
24 weeks shall be construed accordingly.”.
