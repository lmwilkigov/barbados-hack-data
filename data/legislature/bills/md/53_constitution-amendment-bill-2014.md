CONSTITUTION (AMENDMENT) BILL, 2014

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

In light of the decision of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in Case

12645: Tyrone Dacosta Cadagon v. Barbados, the Cabinet1 determined that

(a)

(b)

the mandatory imposition of death penalty in respect of the offence of
murder should be abolished; and

section 2 of the Offences Against the Person Act, Cap. 141 be amended
specifically  to  abolish  the  mandatory  imposition  of  the  sentence  of
death for offence of murder.

It is important to note that the Cabinet did not express any intention to abolish

the death penalty.

The  Constitution  (Amendment)  Bill,  2014  would  alter  the  Constitution  of

Barbados to

(a)

(b)

(c)

delete the provision authorising a mandatory imposition of death for
the offence of murder in section 15; and

amend section 26 to redefine the effect of existing law in relation to
the fundamental rights provisions;

refine  the  exercise  by  the  Governor-General  of  the  Prerogative  of
Mercy.

Clause 1:

Clause 2:

Clause 1 states that this Act may be cited as the Constitution
(Amendment) Act, 2014.

Clause  2  repealed  and  replaced  section  15  to  remove  the
provision authorising a mandatory imposition of death for the
offence of murder.

Clause 3:

Clause 4:

Constitution (Amendment) Bill, 2014

Clause 3 redefine the effect of existing law in relation to the
fundamental rights provisions.

Clause  4  repealed  and  replaced  section  78  to  remove  the
Governor-General’s  capacity  to  direct  that  there  should  be
time limits within which person may appeal to, or consult, any
person or body of persons (other than Her Majesty in Council)
outside Barbados in relation to an offence. This alteration was
necessary since it is the policy of the Government to allow
persons to appeal or consult with entities outside of Barbados
in  relation  to  offences  particularly  that  of  murder.  The
imposition of a time limit on this right to appeal or consult
would operate as an unfair restriction of that right.
