The Director of Public Prosecutions may apply to a judge in
8.(1)

entity, as the case may be, where

(a)

the  person  is  included  in  a  list  of  individuals  and  entities
designated  as  terrorists  or  terrorist  entities  by  the  United
Nations Security Council; or

5

(b)

to believe that the person has committed or participated in the
commission of an offence referred to in section 3, 3A or 4.

(2)

An application for a terrorist designation order shall be

(a)

(b)

made ex parte; and

supported  by  affidavit  deposing  to  the  matters  set  out  in
subsection (1)(a) or (b), as the case may be.

The  judge  shall  make  a  terrorist  designation  order  against  a
(3)
person where he is satisfied of the circumstances set out in subsection
(1)(a) or (b) in relation to the person.

A person against whom a terrorist designation order is made may,
(4)
within 60 days of the making of the order, appeal to the Court of Appeal
against the decision of the judge to make the order and shall give the
Director  of  Public  Prosecutions  at  least  14  days’  notice  of  the
application.

The Director of Public Prosecutions may, within 30 days of the
(5)

of the Director of Public Prosecutions, hear all or part of that
evidence  or  information  in  the  absence  of  the  person

security or endanger the safety of any person;

6

(b)

(c)

(d)

provide the person concerned with a statement summarizing
the evidence or information available to the court in order to
reasonably inform the person of the reasons for the making
of  the  terrorist  designation  order,  without  disclosing  any
evidence or information the disclosure of which would, in the
opinion  of  the  court,  be  prejudicial  to  national  security  or
endanger the safety of any person;

provide the person concerned with a reasonable opportunity
to be heard; and

direct  the  judge  to  make,  confirm,  vary  or  set  aside  the
terrorist designation order, as the court considers appropriate.

on appeal under this section.

under  section  8  in  order  to  determine  whether  the
circumstances referred to in section 8(l)(a) or (b) continue to
exist in respect of the person against whom the order was
made; and

where he determines that such circumstances no longer exist
in relation to a person, apply to a judge in Chambers for the
variation  or  revocation  of  the  terrorist  designation  order
relating to that person.

Upon  an  application  under  subsection  (1)(b),  the  judge  shall,
(2)
where he is satisfied that the circumstances leading to the designation

7

of a person as a terrorist or terrorist entity no longer exist, vary or revoke
the terrorist designation order relating to the person.

Publication of terrorism designation orders

10.(1)
The Director of Public Prosecutions shall, within 7 days of
the decision of a judge in Chambers, whether at first instance or on the
order  of  the  Court  of  Appeal,  to  make,  confirm,  vary  or  set  aside  a
terrorism designation order, cause notice of the decision to be published
in the Official Gazette and at least 2 daily newspapers in circulation in
Barbados, and may publish such notice electronically.

A  notice  referred  to  in  subsection  (1)  shall  contain  sufficient
(2)
particulars to enable anyone who may be affected by the decision to be
reliably and adequately informed of the decision.”.
