14,

is guilty of an offence and is liable, on summary conviction, to a fine of $50 000
or to imprisonment for one year or to both.

disclosure, by a specified person in public life, of property, which should have
been disclosed in a declaration, the magistrate shall order the specified person in
public life to make full disclosure of the property within a specified period.

Where a specified person in public life fails to comply with an order made

Where the Commission finds that

28

(a)

a gift was given to a specified person in public life personally and

was not trivial but was not intended to be a motive or reward for
doing or forbearing to do anything in the course of the discharge

forbear from doing anything,

the Commission shall allow the specified person in public life to retain the
gift; or

(b)

public life shall comply with the direction within the time so specified.

Nothing in this Part shall be taken to alter any law, rule or decision which
(8)
prohibits a particular specified person in public life or class of specified persons
in public life from receiving gifts in the course of discharging official functions.

(9)
who is required to make a report to him under subsection (2) and any report so

PART VIII

INVESTIGATIONS

Powers of Investigative Officers

Power of arrest

An investigative officer has, in carrying out his functions, the powers

that assigns responsibility for investigations to the Commission.

An investigative officer shall, after making an arrest, deliver the person
(2)
arrested to the custody of a member of the Police Force who shall immediately
bring the person before a magistrate.

39

Disclosure orders

42.(1)
Where on an application made by an investigative officer, a judge in
Chambers is satisfied that each of the requirements set out in subsection (3) is
fulfilled, the judge may make an order authorising the officer to give to any person
the  officer  considers  has  relevant  information,  notice  in  writing  requiring  the
person, with respect to any matter relevant to the investigation for the purposes
of which the order is sought, to

(a)

(b)

(c)

answer any question, either at a time specified in the notice or at once,
at a place so specified;

provide  any  information  specified  in  the  notice,  by  a  time  and  in  a
manner so specified;

produce any document, or any documents of a description, specified
in the notice, either at or by a time so specified or at once, and in a
manner so specified.

An application for a disclosure order shall be made without notice and shall
(2)
state that a person specified in the application is subject to an investigation under
this Act or any other enactment that assigns responsibility for investigations to
the Commission.

The requirements referred to in subsection (1) are that there are reasonable

(3)
grounds for

(a)

suspecting that the person specified in the application has committed
an  offence  under  this  Act  or  any  other  enactment  that  assigns
responsibility for the investigation of offences to the Commission; and

(b)

believing that

(i)

information which may be provided in compliance with the order
is likely to be of substantial value, whether or not by itself, to the
investigation for the purposes of which the order is sought; and

40

(ii)

it is in the public interest for the information to be provided, having
regard  to  the  benefit  likely  to  accrue  to  the  investigation  if  the
information is obtained.

(4)
A person is not bound to comply with a requirement imposed by a notice
given under a disclosure order unless evidence of authority to give the notice is
produced to him.

(5)

A person who

(b)

without reasonable excuse, fails to comply with a requirement imposed

(7)
requirement imposed by a disclosure order may not be used in evidence against
the person in criminal proceedings.

(8)

Subsection (7) does not apply in the case of

(a)

(b)

proceedings for contempt of court;

a prosecution for an offence under subsection (6);

41

(c)

(d)

subsection (7).

A statement may not be used by virtue of subsection (8)(d) against a person

(9)
unless

(a)

(b)

evidence relating to it is adduced; or

a question relating to it is asked,

by or on behalf of the person in the proceedings arising out of the prosecution.

A  disclosure  order  has  effect  notwithstanding  any  obligation  as  to
(10)
confidentiality  or  any  other  restriction  upon  the  disclosure  of  information
imposed by any enactment, rule of law or otherwise.

For the purposes of subsection (1), “relevant information” is information,
(11)
whether or not contained in a document, which the investigative officer considers
to be relevant to the investigation.

Sections 145 and 148 of the Proceeds and Instrumentalities of Crime Act,
(12)
2019 (Act 2019-17) apply in respect of a disclosure order made under this section
as those sections apply to a disclosure order made under that Act and for the

shall be construed to include an investigative officer.

Search and seizure warrants

(2)

An application for a search and seizure warrant shall

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

specify the person subject to investigation;

state that the warrant is sought for the purposes of the investigation;

specify the premises in respect of which the warrant is sought; and

the premises that

(i)

relates to the person specified in the application or the question
whether that person has committed an offence under this Act or
any  other  enactment
the
investigation of offences to the Commission; and

that  assigns  responsibility  for

investigation for the purposes of which the warrant is sought.

(3)

The circumstances referred to in subsection (1) are that

(a)

(b)

a disclosure order in relation to material has not been complied with
and there are reasonable grounds for believing that the material is on

Act or any other enactment that assigns responsibility for investigations
to the Commission and

the conditions specified in subsection (4) are fulfilled; or

(ii)

the conditions specified in subsection (5) are fulfilled.

43

(4)

The conditions referred to in subsection (3)(b)(i) are that

(a)

there are reasonable grounds for believing that

(i)

any material on the premises specified in the application for the
warrant is likely to be of substantial value, whether or not by itself,
to the investigation for the purposes of which the warrant is sought;
and

(ii)

it is in the public interest for the material to be obtained, having
regard  to  the  benefit  likely  to  accrue  to  the  investigation  if  the
material is obtained; and

(b)

it would not be appropriate to make a disclosure order because

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

it  is  not  practicable  to  communicate  with  any  person  against
whom the disclosure order could be made;

it is not practicable to communicate with any person who would
be required to comply with an order to grant entry to the premises;
or

the  investigation  might  be  seriously  prejudiced  unless  an
investigative  officer  is  able  to  secure  immediate  access  to  the
material.

(5)

The conditions referred to in subsection (3)(b)(ii) are that

(a)

there are reasonable grounds for believing where the material cannot
be identified at the time of the application, that there is material on the
premises specified in the application for the warrant that

(i)

relates to the person specified in the application or the question
whether he has committed an offence under this Act or any other
enactment  that  assigns  responsibility  for  investigations  to  the
Commission; and

(ii)

is likely to be of substantial value, whether or not by itself, to the
investigation for the purposes of which the warrant is sought; and

44

(b)

there are reasonable grounds for believing that it is in the public interest

(ii)

(iii)

it  is  not  practicable  to  communicate  with  any  person  against
whom a disclosure order could be made;

entry  to  the  premises  will  not  be  granted  unless  a  warrant  is
produced; or

the  investigation  might  be  seriously  prejudiced  unless  an
investigative  officer  arriving  at  the  premises  is  able  to  secure
immediate entry to them.

A search and seizure warrant does not confer the right to seize privileged

(6)
material.

Obstruction of investigative officer

A  person  who  resists  or  obstructs  an  investigative  officer  in  the
44.
execution of his duty is guilty of an offence and is liable, on summary conviction,
