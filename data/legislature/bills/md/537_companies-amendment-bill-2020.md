Amendment of section 175 of Cap. 308

2.
Section 175 of the Companies Act, Cap. 308, in this Act referred to
as the principal Act, is amended by inserting immediately after subsection (4),
the following new subsections:

“(5)

The Registrar may require a company to produce

(a)

(b)

any books, records or other documents required to be kept by
the company under any provision of this Act; and

such other information as the Registrar may require for the
proper administration and enforcement of this Act.

Notwithstanding subsection (4), the Registrar may examine, or
(6)
by instrument in writing, appoint, at the expense of a company, a person
to examine, any books, records and other documents required to be kept
by the company under any provision of this Act

(a)

(b)

(c)

in order to ascertain whether the company is in compliance
with this Act;

where the Registrar has reasonable grounds to suspect that
the company may be in contravention of this Act; or

where the examination is otherwise necessary for the proper
administration and enforcement of this Act.

For the purposes of subsection (6), the Registrar or the person
(7)
appointed by the Registrar may, in connection with an examination,
require an auditor, director, officer or affiliate of a company or a person
who, whether alone or in association with others, owns or controls the
company to

(a)

furnish  such  information  as  the  Registrar  or  the  person
appointed by him may consider necessary for the purpose of
the examination; and

5

(b)

produce  for  examination  any  books,  records  or  other
documents relating to the business of the company that are in
his  possession  and  contain,  or  are  likely  to  contain,  such
information.

The Registrar may require a company to pay the expenses of any
(8)
examination  carried  out  by  or  on  behalf  of  the  Registrar  under  this
section.

A person who is required to make a disclosure to the Registrar
(9)
or to a person appointed by the Registrar under subsection (6) shall not,
by reason of making the disclosure, be regarded as being in breach of
a duty to the company.

The Registrar may give directions to a company for the purpose

(10)
of compliance with this section.

Where  a  company  fails  to  pay  the  expenses  referred  to  in
(11)
subsection  (8),  the  expenses  may  be  recovered  as  a  debt  due  to  the
Crown before a magistrate for District ‘A’.

A  person  who,  without  reasonable  cause,  is  in  default  in
(12)
complying  with  a  requirement  under  subsection  (5),  (6)  or  (7)  or  a
direction given under subsection (10)

(a)

(b)

is liable to a penalty of $5,000 payable to the Registrar; and

if  the  penalty  is  not  paid  on  the  due  date,  is  liable  to  an
additional  penalty  of  $500  for  everyday  during  which  the
default continues not exceeding $15 000.

A  person  who,  without  reasonable  cause,  continues  to  be  in
(13)
default in complying with a requirement or a direction referred to in
subsection (12) after the maximum additional penalty referred to in that
subsection  becomes  payable,  is  guilty  of  an  offence  and  liable,  on
summary conviction, to a fine of $100,000 or to imprisonment for a
term of 5 years or to both.

6

(14)
When an offence under subsection (13) is committed by a body
corporate and a director or officer of that body corporate knowingly
authorised, permitted or acquiesced in the commission of the offence,
the director or officer is also guilty of the offence and liable on summary
conviction, to a fine of $100,000 or to imprisonment for a term of 5
years or to both.”.

(e.1) of section 448, issue guidelines on the application or interpretation
of the term “beneficial ownership” and the identification of beneficial
owners whether by reference to thresholds in respect of ownership or
control or otherwise.

(2)
Any person who fails to comply with a guideline issued under
subsection  (1)  is  guilty  of  an  offence  and  is  liable  on  summary
conviction to a fine of $100,000 or to imprisonment of a term of 5 years
or to both.”.
