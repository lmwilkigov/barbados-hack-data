which\napply in whole or in part to the same area and there is any conflict or discrepancy\nbetween them, then\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe plan drawn to the larger scale has precedence;\n\nthe later plan is deemed to have modified the earlier plan, regardless\nof  the  relative  scales  of  the  two  plans,  unless  there  is  an  express\nprovision to the contrary.\n\nAn  approved  physical  development  plan  remains  in  effect  until  it  is\n(3)\nrescinded by affirmative resolution of both Houses of Parliament and a notice to\nthat effect is published in the Official Gazette.\n\nPlanning Policy Documents\n\nAt  any  time  after  the  national  physical  development  plan  has  been\n19.(1)\napproved,  the  Chief  Town  Planner  may  prepare  or  cause  to  be  prepared\nsupplementary

permission is not required for the\nresumption of the use of the land for the purpose for which it is normally used.\n\nWhere  land  is  normally  used  for  one  purpose  and  was  also  used

of this Part or in contravention of previous planning control.\n\nWhere  planning  permission  is  granted  subject  to  limitations  by  a\n(9)\ndevelopment order, planning permission is not required for the use of that land\nwhich (apart from its use for the permitted development) is the normal use of that\nland, unless the last-mentioned use was begun in contravention of this Part or

permission having been submitted, on payment of the\nprescribed fee, and every such application shall be determined by the Chief Town\nPlanner within 14 days of the date of submission.\n\nFor  the  avoidance  of  doubt,  it  is  hereby  declared  that  the  question  of\n(3)\nwhether an application for planning permission is required is inherent in every\napplication for planning permission

development in any particular area or in\nrelation to any particular development.\n\nIn a development order made under this section, the Minister shall not grant\n(5)\nplanning permission for any type of development in a coastal zone management\narea established under the Coastal Zone Management Act, Cap. 394 which is\nprohibited by a coastal zone management plan approved in accordance with that\nAct.\n\nTo  enable  development  to  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  planning\n(6)\npermission granted under this Part, or otherwise to promote proper development\nin accordance with the development plan, a development order may direct that\nany Act, statutory instrument or other enactment which was in force before the\ndate of commencement of this Act, or any statutory instruments made (whether\nbefore or after that day) under such Act or other enactment shall not apply to any\n\n\f39\n\ndevelopment  specified  in  the  order,  or  shall  apply  thereto  subject  to  such\nmodifications as may be specified.\n\nConsultation before applying for planning permission\n\n24.(1)\nThe  Minister  may  by  a  development  order  require  a  person  who\nproposes  to  make  an  application  for  planning  permission  for  a  proposed\ndevelopment,  of  a  class  specified  in  the  order,  carry  out  consultations  on  the\nproposed  application  in  accordance  with  this  section  before  making  the\napplication.\n\nA person required to carry out consultations with respect to a proposed\n(2)\ndevelopment  shall  consult  the  Chief  Town  Planner  and  such  other  regulatory\nagencies or persons as the Chief Town Planner may specify.\n\nA person subject to the duty imposed by this section shall have regard to\n(3)\nthe advice given by the Chief Town Planner and other persons duly consulted\nwith respect to the plans, studies and other information that will be required by\nthe Department and other regulatory agencies in order to determine the proposed\napplication expeditiously.\n\nWhen an application is made following consultations carried out pursuant\n(4)\nto this section, the fees payable with respect to consultations before applying for\nplanning permission shall be offset against the application fee payable by the\napplicant.\n\nApproval in principle\n\n25.(1)\nAny person who intends to apply for a planning permission may make\napplication to the Board for approval in principle of the proposed development\nat the conceptual stage, before preparing detailed plans.\n\nAn  application  for  approval  in  principle  shall  be  made  on  the  form\n(2)\nprescribed by the Chief Town Planner accompanied by such conceptual plans\nand other information as the Chief Town Planner requires for its evaluation.\n\n\f40\n\n(3)\nThe information which the Chief Town Planner may require pursuant to\nsubsection  (2)  includes  an  initial  environmental  evaluation  of  the  proposed\ndevelopment.\n\n(4)\nThe Board may grant approval in principle, with or without conditions,\nsubject to the subsequent approval of any matter reserved until detailed plans and\nfurther  information,  including  but  not  limited  to  an  environmental  impact\nassessment, have been submitted, or may refuse to grant approval in principle.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, approval in principle granted under subsection\n(5)\n(4) is not permission to commence development and the applicant shall comply\nwith the provisions of section 26 before planning permission is granted.\n\nWhere  the  Board  is  of  the  opinion  that  an  application  for  approval  in\n(6)\nprinciple  ought  not  to  be  considered  without  the  submission  of  the  detailed\ninformation required for an application for planning permission under section 26,\nthe  Chief  Town  Planner  shall  notify  the  applicant  forthwith  that  the  Board  is\nunable to determine the application for approval in principle.\n\nWhere after the grant of approval in principle, further information becomes\n(7)\navailable to the Board, or a situation subsequently arises, whereby in the opinion\nof the Board the proposed development would be detrimental to the environment,\nthe  cultural  or  natural  heritage,  public  health,  safety  or  welfare,  or  would\nconstitute a potential danger to national security, approval in principle granted\nunder this section may be revoked or modified by the Board, by notice in writing\nwhich  specifies  the  reasons  for  the  modification  or  revocation,  without  any\ncompensation.\n\nApplications for planning permission\n\n26.(1)\nTown Planner and shall be\n\nAn application for planning permission shall be submitted to the Chief\n\n(a)\n\nmade in such form and include such drawings and other particulars as\nmay be prescribed by regulations; and\n\n\f41\n\n(b)\n\naccompanied by proof of payment of the appropriate application fee\nprescribed by regulations.\n\n(2)\nThe Chief Town Planner may cancel an application made under this Part\nand return it to the applicant with a notice to that effect, within 28 days of the\nreceipt of the application, where the Chief Town Planner is of the opinion that\nthe application is premature, having regard to\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nthe means of access to the land to which the application relates and the\nneed  to  make  provision  or  better  provision  for  access  before\ndevelopment can be permitted;\n\nany existing deficiency in the provision of water or electricity supplies\nto the land to which the application relates and the period within which\nany such deficiency may reasonably be expected to be made good; or\n\nthe prejudicial effect that determination of the application would have\non the formulation of a physical development plan for the area in which\nthe land to which the application relates is situated.\n\nWhen an application is withdrawn by the applicant, or is cancelled pursuant\n(3)\nto subsection (2), the applicant is not entitled to a refund of any application fee\npaid with respect to that application or to any form of compensation.\n\nRequirements for further information\n\n27.(1)\napplicant for planning permission to\n\nThe  Chief  Town  Planner  may,  by  notice  in  writing,  require  an\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nsubmit,  within  such  time  as  may  be  prescribed  in  the  notice,  such\nfurther information as may be specified in the notice as the Chief Town\nPlanner considers necessary to enable the Board or the Minister, as the\ncase may be, to determine the application; or\n\nwithout  prejudice  to  the  generality  of  paragraph  (a),  cause  an\nenvironmental impact assessment of the proposed development to be\ncarried  out  pursuant  to  section  30  and  an  environmental  impact\nstatement to be submitted to the Chief Town Planner.\n\n\f42\n\n(2)\nThe power of the Chief Town Planner to require further information under\nsubsection (1)(a) is exercisable once with respect to each application and shall\nbe exercised within 28 days of submission of the application.\n\n(3)\nWhere  further  information  is  required  under  paragraphs  (a)  or  (b)  of\nsubsection (1), the application is treated as having been made on the date when\nthe  further  information  was  submitted,  so  that  the  period  provided  for  the\ndetermination of the application specified in section 34(1) does not commence\nuntil the date of receipt of the further information.\n\nWhere  an  applicant  does  not  furnish  the  Chief  Town  Planner  with  the\n(4)\nfurther information required under paragraphs (a) or (b) of subsection (1) within\nthe period specified in the notice, or such longer period as may be agreed upon\nbetween the applicant and the Chief Town Planner, the Chief Town Planner may\ncancel the application and may return it to the applicant with a notice to that\neffect,  or  the  Board  or  the  Minister,  as  the  case  may  be,  may  refuse  to  grant\nplanning permission, as they think fit.\n\nWhen an application is cancelled pursuant to subsection (4), the applicant\n(5)\nis  not  entitled  to  a  refund  of  any  application  fee  paid  with  respect  to  that\napplication or to any form of compensation.\n\nCoordination with referral agencies\n\nAny referral agency which receives a request in writing from the Chief\n28.(1)\nTown  Planner  for  their  technical  advice  on  an  application  shall  reply  to  that\nrequest within the period, being not more than 21 days, specified in the request\nmade by the Chief Town Planner.\n\nIn specifying the period within which a referral agency shall reply to a\n(2)\nrequest for technical advice, the Chief Town Planner shall have regard to the\nperiod  within  which  the  application  shall  be  determined  specified  in  section\n34(1).\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that if a referral agency,\n(3)\nomits to submit their comments on an application to the Chief Town Planner\nwithin the period specified in the request for comments, the comments of that\n\n\f43\n\nagency may be disregarded by the Board or the Minister, as the case may be, in\ndetermining the application.\n\nPublicity for applications\n\n29.(1)\nA development order may make provision requiring notice to be given\nof  any  application  of  a  specified  class  and  provide  for  publicising  such\napplications and for the form, contents and service of such notices.\n\nWithout prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), such publicity shall\n\n(2)\nbe required with respect to\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nany  application  for  which  an  environmental  impact  assessment  is\nrequired pursuant to section 30;\n\nany application of strategic economic or environmental significance\nwhich is to be referred to the Minister pursuant to section 33; and\n\nany application for development that is inconsistent in some material\nrespect with an approved physical development plan for the area in\nwhich the proposed development is located.\n\nIn determining an application to which this section relates, the Board or\n(3)\nthe  Minister,  as  the  case  may  be,  shall  take  into  account  any  objection,\nrepresentation  or  comment  submitted  or  made  with  respect  to  the  application\nunder this section.\n\nWhere the applicant fails to comply with the requirements of a notice given\n(4)\nunder subsection (1) the Chief Town Planner shall determine that the application\nhas been withdrawn by the applicant and may cancel and return the application\nto the applicant.\n\nWhen an application is cancelled pursuant to subsection (4), the applicant\n(5)\nis  not  entitled  to  a  refund  of  any  application  fee  paid  with  respect  to  that\napplication or to any form of compensation\n\n\f44\n\nEnvironmental Impact Assessment\n\n30.(1)\nThe  Chief  Town  Planner  may  require  an  environmental  impact\nassessment to be carried out by the applicant in respect of any application for\npermission to develop land, if the proposed development, by reason of its nature,\nscale or location, could significantly affect the environment.\n\nUnless the Minister directs otherwise, the Chief Town Planner shall require\n(2)\nan  environmental  impact  assessment  in  respect  of  an  application  for  a\ndevelopment of any kind mentioned in the Third Schedule.\n\nThe Board or the Minister, as the case may be, may not grant permission\n(3)\nfor  the  development  of  land  pursuant  to  an  application  to  which  this  section\napplies  unless  an  environmental  impact  statement  has  first  been  taken  into\naccount.\n\nThe  Minister  shall  make  environmental  impact  assessment  regulations\n\n(4)\nproviding for\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nthe criteria and procedures for determining whether an activity is likely\nto significantly affect the environment so that an environmental impact\nassessment  may  be  required  in  addition  to  the  information  that  the\napplicant is ordinarily required to submit;\n\nthe procedures for settling the scope of works of the environmental\nimpact assessment to be carried out by the applicant in respect of any\ndevelopment;\n\nthe  minimum  contents  of  an  environmental  impact  statement  to  be\nsubmitted to the Chief Town Planner in respect of the environmental\nimpact assessment carried out by the applicant;\n\nthe  qualifications,  skills,  knowledge  or  experience  which  shall  be\npossessed  by  persons  conducting  environmental  impact  assessment\nstudies for the purposes of this Act;\n\n\f45\n\n(e)\n\n(f)\n\n(g)\n\nthe  procedures  for  public  participation  in  the  environmental  impact\nassessment process and public scrutiny of the environmental impact\nstatement submitted to the Chief Town Planner;\n\nthe  procedure  and  criteria  for  review  of  the  environmental  impact\nstatement; and\n\nthe consideration by the Board of an application with respect to which\nan environmental impact assessment has been required.\n\nWhen the Chief Town Planner notifies an applicant that an environmental\n(5)\nimpact  assessment  is  required,  the  Department  and  any  other,  including  any\nstatutory undertaker, if requested by the applicant, shall enter into consultation\nwith  the  applicant  to  determine  whether  that  department  or  agency  of\nGovernment has in its possession any information which the applicant considers\nrelevant to the environmental impact assessment and, if it does, the department\nor  agency  of  Government  shall  make  any  such  information  available  to  the\napplicant and allow the applicant to take copies on payment of the cost of making\nthe  copies,  but  is  not  required  to  disclose  any  confidential  information  to  the\napplicant  or  to  do  anything  that  contravenes  the  provisions  of  the  Copyright\nAct, Cap. 300.\n\nWhen a notice requiring an applicant to carry out an environmental impact\n(6)\nassessment  is  issued,  the  Chief  Town  Planner  shall  notify  any  department  or\nagency of the Government of Barbados having responsibility for the issue of any\nlicence,  permit,  approval,  consent  or  other  document  of  authorisation  in\nconnection with any matter affecting the development.\n\nA department or agency of the Government of Barbados that has been given\n(7)\nnotice  in  accordance  with  subsection  (6),  may  not  grant  its  licence,  permit,\napproval, consent or other document of authorisation, unless it has been notified\nby  the  Chief  Town  Planner  that  the  notice  has  been  complied  with  and  that\nplanning permission has been granted for the proposed development.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that in addition to the\n(8)\napplication fee prescribed with respect to an application for planning permission\n\n\f46\n\nfor which an environmental impact assessment is required, if any, the applicant\nmay be liable to an additional fee for the review of the environmental impact\nstatement, payable upon submission of the environmental impact statement for\nreview.\n\nPermission to regularise unauthorised development\n\nThe power of the Board to grant planning permissions under this Part\n31.(1)\nincludes power to grant permission for the retention on land of any buildings or\nworks constructed or carried out before the date of the application, or for the\ncontinuation of any use of land instituted before that date, and references in this\nPart to planning permission and to applications for planning permission are to be\nconstrued accordingly.\n\nAny planning permission granted in accordance with subsection (1) may\n(2)\ntake effect from the date on which the buildings or works were constructed or\ncarried out, or the use was instituted.\n\nIn  the  case  of  buildings  or  works  constructed  or  a  use  instituted  in\n(3)\naccordance with planning permission granted for a limited period, any planning\npermission granted in accordance with subsection (1) may be granted so as to\ntake effect from the end of that period.\n\nThe application fee payable with respect to an application for the retention\n(4)\nof  unauthorised  development  to  which  this  section  applies,  as  prescribed  by\nregulations made under section 104, shall exceed the application fee ordinarily\npayable with respect to applications for prior permission for the same class of\ndevelopment.\n\nDetermination of applications by the Board\n\nWhen  an  application  for  permission  to  develop  land,  other  than  an\n32.(1)\napplication to which section 33 relates, is duly made, the application shall be\ndealt with by the Department and submitted, together with a statement containing\nthe observations and recommendations of the Chief Town Planner, to the Board\nfor determination.\n\n\f47\n\n(2)\nThe Board shall have regard to the provisions of the physical development\nplan for the area within which the land is situated, if any, and to any other material\nconsiderations, and, subject to subsection (3), may grant planning permission,\neither unconditionally or subject to conditions, or refuse permission.\n\nWhere  the  Board  grants  planning  permission  subject  to  conditions  or\n(3)\nrefuses permission, the Board shall give reasons in writing for its decision in the\nnotice of planning permission or refusal, as the case may be.\n\nIn determining an application for planning permission, the Board, shall be\n(4)\nguided by a presumption in favour of granting planning permission and, where\nit appears that a proposed development which would otherwise be refused can\nbe permitted subject to conditions if the application is modified, the Board shall\nissue  to  the  applicant  a  notice  of  provisional  refusal  which  specifies  the\nmodifications to the development proposal that are required before permission\nmay be granted.\n\nWhere  an  applicant  to  whom  a  notice  of  provisional  refusal  is  issued\n(5)\nconsents  to  modify  the  development  proposal  as  specified,  and  makes  the\nmodifications within such time as may be prescribed in the notice, the Board shall\ncancel  the  provisional  refusal  and  grant  planning  permission  subject  to  such\nconditions as it sees fit.\n\nWhere  an  applicant  to  whom  a  notice  of  provisional  refusal  is  issued\n(6)\nconsents  to  modify  the  development  proposal  but  requests  an  opportunity  to\nnegotiate with respect to the required modifications, the Board shall enter into\nsuch  negotiations  with  the  applicant  for  up  to  28  days,  and  shall  cancel  the\nprovisional refusal and grant planning permission, subject to such conditions as\nare agreed, if the issues in contention are resolved in the negotiations, or otherwise\nshall confirm the refusal of planning permission.\n\nWhere an applicant to whom a notice of provisional refusal is issued does\n(7)\nnot consent to modify the development as specified in the notice and does not\nopt  to  enter  into  negotiations  with  respect  to  the  required  modifications  or\nproposed conditions within 28 days of the date of issue of the notice, the Board\nshall confirm the refusal of planning permissions.\n\n\f48\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, it is declared that the considerations which the\n\n(8)\nBoard shall take into account in determining an application include\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\n(e)\n\n(f)\n\nthe advice of the Chief Town Planner;\n\nany other further information submitted by the applicant in support of\nthe application pursuant to section 27;\n\nthe comments made by any referral agency or other statutory body or\nperson  consulted  by  the  Chief  Town  Planner  with  respect  to  the\napplication pursuant to section 28;\n\nthe objections, representations or comments made by any person with\nrespect to an application which has been publicised pursuant to section\n29;\n\nthe  proposed\nthe  environmental\ndevelopment submitted to the Chief Town Planner pursuant to section\n30, if any; and\n\nimpact  statement  concerning\n\nwhere the land is located in a coastal zone management area established\nunder the Coastal Zone Management Act, Cap. 394, the provisions of\nthe coastal zone management plan approved in accordance with that\nAct, if any.\n\nWithout  restricting  the  generality  of  subsection  (2),  conditions  may  be\n\n(9)\nimposed on the grant of planning permission to develop land\n\n(a)\n\nregulating the development or use of any land under the ownership of\nthe  applicant,  whether  or  not  it  is  land  in  respect  of  which  the\napplication  was  made,  including  the  discontinuance  of  any  existing\nuses of the land or requiring the carrying out of works on such land, so\nfar  as  appears  to  the  Board  expedient  for  the  purposes  of  or  in\nconnection with the development authorised by the permission;\n\n(b)\n\nrequiring  the  removal  of  any  buildings  or  works  authorised  by  the\npermission, or the discontinuance of any use of land so authorised, at\n\n\f49\n\nthe end of a specified period, and the carrying out of any works required\nfor re-instatement of the land at the expiration of that period;\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nrequiring the commencement or completion of any development before\na  specified  date  or  on  or  before  the  completion  of  any  other\ndevelopment to be carried out by the same applicant;\n\nrequiring  the  provision  of  proper  services  including  gas,  water,\nelectricity,  telecommunications  and  roads,  before  the  sale,  lease  or\nother disposition of any land for which permission for subdivision for\nresidential, commercial or industrial purposes is given.\n\nAny  planning  permission  granted  subject  to  any  such  condition  as  is\n(10)\nmentioned in subsection (9)(b) is referred to in this Act as “planning permission\nfor a limited period”.\n\n(11)\n\nWhere\n\n(a)\n\nplanning  permission  is  granted  for  development  consisting  of  or\nincluding the carrying out of building or other operations subject to a\ncondition that shall be commenced or completed before a date specified\nin the condition; and\n\n(b)\n\nany building or other operations are commenced or completed after the\ndate so specified,\n\nthen\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\nthe commencement and carrying out of those operations in the case\nof a condition requiring the commencement of those operations\nbefore a date specified in the condition; or\n\nthe carrying out of any operations after the date specified in the\nconditions, in the case of a condition requiring those operations to\nbe completed before such date,\n\ndo not constitute development for which that permission was granted.\n\n\f50\n\n(12)\nFor the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that, where the Board has\ndelegated  the  power  to  determine  applications  to  the  Chief  Town  Planner\npursuant to section 10, the provisions of this section apply mutatis mutandis to\nthe determination of applications by the Chief Town Planner as they apply to the\ndetermination of applications by the Board.\n\nReferral of applications to the Minister\n\n33.(1)\nThe Minister may give directions to the Chief Town Planner requiring\nthat any application or class of applications for planning permission specified in\nthe  direction,  being  development  which  would  involve  either  a  significant\ndeparture  from  the  approved  physical  development  plan  or  is  of  strategic\neconomic  or  environmental  significance,  shall  be  referred  to  the  Minister  for\ndetermination.\n\nWhere an application which is to be referred to the Minister under this\n(2)\nsection is duly made, the application shall be dealt with by the Department and\nsubmitted,  together  with  a  statement  containing  the  observations  and\nrecommendations of the Chief Town Planner, to the Minister for determination.\n\nWhere an application for planning permission is referred to the Minister\n(3)\nunder this section the Chief Town Planner shall give notice to the applicant and\nany  other  person  who  has  duly  made  an  objection  to  the  grant  of  planning\npermission  when  the  application  was  publicised  pursuant  to  section  29\n(hereinafter referred to as “the objector”), of the referral of the application to the\nMinister.\n\nBefore determining an application under this section, the Minister shall, if\n(4)\nthe  Chief  Town  Planner,  the  applicant  or  the  objector  so  desires,  give  the\naforementioned parties an opportunity to present their case in writing or appear\nbefore and be heard by a person, being a member of the Tribunal, appointed by\nthe President for that purpose.\n\nA hearing referred to in subsection (4) shall be conducted within 42 days\n(5)\nof the date on which the completed application is submitted in accordance with\n\n\f51\n\nthe  procedures  with  respect  to  the  conduct  of  such  hearings  prescribed  by\nregulations.\n\nA person appointed to conduct a hearing under subsection (5) shall, within\n(6)\n21 days of the completion of the hearing, submit a report on the findings and\nconclusions of the hearing to the Minister and copies of every such report shall\nbe  provided  to  the  Chief  Town  Planner  and  the  applicant,  and  shall  be  made\navailable for perusal by any member of the public in documentary form at the\noffice of the Department and in electronic form on the internet.\n\nThe provisions of section 32 apply, with any necessary modifications, to\n(7)\nthe  determination  of  an  application  by  the  Minister  as  they  apply  to  the\ndetermination of an application by the Board.\n\nWhere an application is referred to the Minister for determination under\n(8)\nthis  section,  the  Minister  shall  give  notice  of  the  decision  on  that  application\nwithin 21 days of receipt of the report of the person appointed to conduct the\nhearing, pursuant to subsection (6).\n\nThe  decision  of  the  Minister  made  on  any  application  referred  to  the\n\n(9)\nMinister under this section is final.\n\nLimitation Periods\n\n34.(1)\nWhere an application for planning permission to be determined by the\nBoard is duly made, the Chief Town Planner shall issue a notice of the Board’s\ndecision\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nin  the  case  of  an  application  for  which  an  environmental  impact\nassessment  has  been  submitted,  within  12  weeks  from  the  date  of\nsubmission of the environmental impact statement;\n\nin  the  case  of  an  application  classified  in  the  First  Schedule  as  a\ncomplex  application,  other  than  an  application  for  which  an\nenvironmental impact assessment has been submitted, within a period\nof 10 weeks, from the date of submission of the application;\n\n\f52\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nin the case of any other application, within a period of 6 weeks from\nthe date of submission of the application; or\n\nin  any  case,  such  extended  period  as  may  be  agreed  to  in  writing\nbetween the Chief Town Planner and the applicant.\n\nUnless notice of the Board’s decision is issued within the period prescribed\n(2)\nby subsection (1), the provisions of section 35 apply in relation to the application\nas if it had been refused.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt it is declared that planning permission issued\n(3)\nafter the expiry of the applicable period prescribed in subsection (1) is valid, and\nan  applicant  may  choose  to  accept  the  benefit  of  such  permission  instead  of\nappealing against the decision pursuant to section 35.\n\nRight of Appeal\n\nIf a planning permission is refused by the Board, or is granted by the\n35.(1)\nBoard subject to conditions, an applicant, or any other person having an interest\nin  the  land  (except  a  mortgagee  not  in  possession),  who  is  aggrieved  by  the\ndecision of the Board may, within 28 days from the date of the decision, appeal\nin writing against that decision to the Tribunal in accordance with Part XI, setting\nout the grounds upon which the appeal is made.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that the right to appeal\n(2)\nagainst decisions of the Board under this section includes a right to appeal against\nany such decision made by the Chief Town Planner or any other officer of the\nDepartment under powers delegated by the Board pursuant to section 10.\n\nPlanning obligations\n\n36.(1)\nWhere a person applies for planning permission under this Act, the\nCrown may, on the advice of the Board and with the consent of the Minister,\nenter into an agreement with

fit.\n\n\f53\n\nWithout  restricting  the  generality  of  subsection  (1),  the  obligations\n\n(2)\nincluded in the agreement may\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\ncover matters in respect of which conditions may not be imposed on a\nplanning permission;\n\nimpose  an  obligation  indefinitely  or  for  such  period  as  may  be\nspecified, unconditionally or subject to conditions;\n\nprovide for the making of a contribution (whether of works, money or\nland)  by  the  applicant  towards  the  provision  of  services,  facilities\n(including their future maintenance) and amenities in the area in which\nthe proposed development is to be carried out; or\n\n(d)\n\nprovide for a performance bond or other financial security for ensuring\ndue compliance with the agreement by the applicant.\n\nAn agreement made under this section shall be entered into by way of an\n\n(3)\ninstrument executed as a deed that\n\n(a)\n\nstates  that  the  obligation  imposed  by  the  agreement  are  planning\nobligations for the purposes of this section;\n\n(b)\n\nidentifies the land in respect of which the obligation is being made;\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nidentifies the person entering into the obligation; and\n\nstates the interest that the person entering into the obligation has in the\nland.\n\nAn agreement made under this section shall be a charge on the land that is\n(4)\nthe subject of the planning permission and shall be recorded in the Land Registry\nin accordance with the provisions of the Land Registration Act, Cap. 229.\n\nAny such agreement is binding on the person entering into the agreement\n(5)\nand any person deriving title from that person, until it is discharged in accordance\nwith the provisions of the Land Registration Act, Cap. 229.\n\nNotwithstanding subsection (5), such an agreement may provide that the\n(6)\nperson  entering  into  the  agreement  is  not  bound  by  the  agreement  when  that\n\n\f54\n\nperson no longer has any interest in the land to which the planning permission\nrelates.\n\nWhere there is a breach of a requirement in an agreement entered into under\n(7)\nthis section, to carry out any operations in, on, over or under any land to which\nthe obligation relates, the Minister\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nmay cause any person to enter the land and carry out the operations;\nand\n\nrecover as a civil debt any expenses reasonably incurred in doing so\nfrom the person against whom the obligation is enforceable, in a court\nof competent jurisdiction.\n\nBefore taking any action pursuant to subsection (7), the Minister shall give\n(8)\nnot less than 21 days notice to any person against whom the planning obligation\nis enforceable.\n\nModification and discharge of planning obligations\n\nA planning obligation may be modified by an instrument executed as\n37.(1)\na deed between the parties to the agreement entered into pursuant to section 36\nor in accordance with subsection (3).\n\n(2)\n\nA planning obligation may be discharged in accordance with this section.\n\nA person against whom a planning obligation is enforceable may at any\n(3)\ntime after the expiry of the period prescribed in the agreement or, where no such\nperiod is prescribed, 5 years from the date on which the obligation is entered into,\napply to the Minister for the obligation\n\n(a)\n\nto  have  effect  subject  to  such  modifications  as  are  specified  in  the\napplication; or\n\n(b)\n\nto be discharged.\n\n\f55\n\nWhere  an  application  is  made  under  subsection  (3),  the  Minister  may\n\n(4)\ndetermine\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nthat the obligation shall continue to have effect without modification;\n\nwhere the obligation no longer serves a useful purpose, that it shall be\ndischarged; or\n\nwhere the obligation continues to serve a useful purpose, but would\nserve  that  purpose  equally  well  if  it  had  effect  subject  to  the\nmodifications specified in the application, or any of them, that it shall\nhave effect subject to such modifications.\n\nThe Minister shall give notice of the determination made under subsection\n\n(5)\n(4) to the applicant not later than 3 months after the application is made.\n\nWhere the Minister determines that a planning obligation shall have effect\n(6)\nsubject to any modification, the modified obligation shall be enforceable as if it\nhad been entered into on the date on which the notice of the determination of the\napplication for modification was given to the applicant.\n\nWhere the Minister fails to give notice of a determination in accordance\n(7)\nwith subsection (5) or determines that a planning obligation shall continue to\nhave effect without modification, the applicant may appeal to the Tribunal in\nwriting against that decision in accordance with Part XI, setting out the grounds\nupon which the appeal is made.\n\nWhere the Minister fails to give notice of a determination in accordance\n(8)\nwith subsection (5), it shall be assumed for the purposes of an appeal that the\nMinister  has  determined  that  the  planning  obligations  shall  continue  to  have\neffect without modification.\n\nEffect of planning permission\n\n38.(1)\nWithout  prejudice  to  the  provisions  of  this  Part  as  to  the  lapse,\nmodification  or  revocation  of  planning  permission,  the  permission  granted\nthereby enures for the benefit of the land and of all persons for the time being\n\n\f56\n\nhaving an interest in the land, unless the notice of planning permission expressly\nprovides otherwise.\n\nPlanning permission granted under this Act does not exempt any proposed\n(2)\ndevelopment from any regulatory requirements imposed upon such development\nby or under any other enactment.\n\nDuration of planning permission\n\n39.(1)\nWhere no planning permission covering the same development has\nbeen applied for within 2 years of the grant of approval in principle or such longer\nperiod as may be specified in the notice of approval, that approval in principle\nlapses and ceases to have any force or effect.\n\nPlanning permission is subject to a condition that it lapses and ceases to\n(2)\nhave  effect  if  the  development  to  which  it  relates  has  not  been  substantially\ncommenced within 5 years of the grant of the planning permission, or such longer\nperiod as may be authorised by the Board in any particular case.\n\nWhere planning permission provides for different parts of the development\n(3)\nto  commence  at  different  times,  the  provisions  of  this  section  apply  to  those\nseparate parts of the development as if planning permission was granted for each\nseparate part or stage of the development.\n\nThe  Board  may  serve  written  notice  on  a  person  who  has  commenced\n(4)\ndevelopment  pursuant  to  planning  permission  within  the  prescribed  time,\nrequiring that person to complete the development within the time specified in\nsuch  notice,  and  stating  that  if  the  development  is  not  completed  within  that\nperiod the planning permission will cease to have effect after the expiration of a\nfurther period specified in the notice.\n\nUpon expiration of the further period specified in a notice served under\n(5)\nsubsection (4) the planning permission ceases to be valid or to have any effect\nand any further development or work carried out with respect to the development\nauthorised by that planning permission is a breach of planning control.\n\n\f57\n\n(6)\nFor  the  purposes  of  this  section,  development  by  way  of  building,\nengineering, mining or other operations or the subdivision of land is taken to be\nsubstantially commenced on the earliest date on which either\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nall the operations below the surface level of the site have been carried\nout; or\n\na registered architect or engineer certifies that 20 per cent or more of\nthe  building  or  engineering  operations  authorised  by  the  planning\npermission have been carried out.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that no compensation is\n(7)\npayable with respect to any loss arising from the lapse of planning permission\nunder this section.\n\nAny person upon whom a notice is served under subsection (4) may at any\n(8)\ntime within the period specified therein for the completion of the development\nappeal in writing to the Tribunal against the notice on the grounds that the time\nallowed for compliance falls short of what should reasonably be allowed.\n\nNon-material changes to planning permission\n\n40.(1)\nWhenever plans have been submitted to the Chief Town Planner in\napplication for planning permission and such permission has been granted, the\ndevelopment shall be carried out in accordance with the approved plans and any\nconditions imposed by the Board or the Minister, as the case may be.\n\nThe  Chief  Town  Planner  may  approve  any  minor  variation  to  plans\n(2)\napproved by the Board, provided that the variations do not materially alter or\naffect the terms and conditions subject to which planning permission was granted,\nand inform the Board of the action which has been taken in that particular case.\n\nWhere  the  Chief  Town  Planner  is  requested  to  approve  a  variation  to\n(3)\napproved  plans  under  subsection  (2),  but  is  of  the  opinion  that  the  proposed\nvariation will materially alter or affect the terms and conditions subject to which\nplanning  permission  was  granted,  the  Chief  Town  Planner  shall  inform  the\napplicant in writing that a fresh application is required.\n\n\f58\n\nCompletion of development\n\n41.(1)\nThis  section  has  effect  where  planning  permission  is  subject  to  a\ncondition that the development to which the permission relates shall be carried\nout  by  or  before  a  specified  date  and  the  development  is  begun  but  is  not\ncompleted before the specified date.\n\nWhere, in the opinion of the Chief Town Planner, the development will\n(2)\nnot be completed within a reasonable period after the specified date, the Board\nmay give notice (in this section referred to as a “completion notice”) that the\nplanning  permission  shall  cease  to  have  effect  at  the  expiration  of  a  period\nspecified in the notice, being not less than one year after the notice takes effect.\n\n(3)\n\nA completion notice\n\n(a)\n\nshall be served on the owner and occupier of the land and on any other\nperson who, in the opinion of the Chief Town Planner, will be affected\nby the notice; and\n\n(b)\n\ntakes effect within 28 days from the date of service on the owner of the\nland, if and when it is confirmed by the Minister.\n\nIn  confirming  a  completion  notice,  the  Minister  may  substitute,  for  the\n(4)\nperiod specified in the notice, some longer period as the period at the expiration\nof which the planning permission will cease to have effect.\n\nWhere  a  completion  notice  takes  effect,  at  the  expiration  of  the  period\n(5)\nspecified  in  the  completion  notice  or  such  longer  period  substituted  by  the\nMinister,  as  the  case  may  be,  the  planning  permission  referred  to  therein  is\ninvalid, except in so far as it authorises any development carried out under the\nplanning permission before the expiration of that period.\n\nAny person upon whom a completion notice is served under this section\n(6)\nmay appeal in writing against that decision to the Tribunal in accordance with\nPart XI, setting out the grounds upon which the appeal is made.\n\n\f59\n\nModification or revocation of planning permission\n\n42.(1)\nSubject to the provisions of this section, where it appears to the Board,\nafter consideration of such advice as may be given by the Chief Town Planner,\nthat it is desirable that any planning permission ought to be modified or revoked,\nthe Board may, with the consent of the Minister, by written notice to the person\nentitled  to  the  benefit  of  the  permission,  revoke  or  modify  the  planning\npermission to such extent as it considers desirable.\n\n(2)\n\nThe power conferred on the Board by this section may be exercised\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nwhere the planning permission relates to the carrying out of building\nor  other  operations,  at  any  time  before  those  operations  have  been\ncompleted;\n\nwhere the planning permission relates only to the making of a material\nchange  in  the  use  of  building  or  other  land,  at  any  time  before  the\nchange has taken place; and\n\nwhere the planning permission relates to the subdivision of land, at any\ntime  before  the  subdivision  plan  has  been  recorded  in  the  Land\nRegistry.\n\nThe modification or revocation of a planning permission for the carrying\n(3)\nout of building or other operations does not affect so much of the operations as\nhas been previously carried out.\n\nA notice of the modification or revocation of a planning permission under\n\n(4)\nthis section shall include\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\na statement of the reasons for the modification or revocation;\n\nsuch directions as the Board considers necessary for the bringing to an\nend any development to which the notice relates;\n\ninformation  as  to  any  claim  for  compensation  that  may  arise  in\nconsequence of the modification or revocation, and the procedure for\nmaking any claim for compensation;\n\n\f60\n\n(d)\n\ninformation as to the right of appeal to the Tribunal under Part XI of\nthis Act; and\n\n(e)\n\nsuch other matters as may be prescribed.\n\n(5)\nUpon the service of a notice under subsection (1), the planning permission\nconcerned  ceases  to  be  valid  or  to  have  effect  to  the  extent  to  which  the\nmodification  or  revocation  so  requires,  and  any  further  development  or  work\ncarried out contrary to such notice is a breach of planning control.\n\nNotwithstanding  subsection  (5),  the  Board,  after  considering  any\n(6)\nrepresentations  made  in  respect  of  such  a  notice,  may  at  any  time  cancel  or\nwithdraw that notice.\n\nAn appeal lies to the Tribunal under Part XI against the issue of a notice\n(7)\nby the Board under subsection (1), or against the refusal of the Board to cancel\nor withdraw such notice under subsection (6).\n\nPending the determination of any such appeal referred to in subsection (7)\n(8)\nthe notice concerned is deemed to be suspended in its operation, save that any\nfurther development or work carried out is a breach of planning control.\n\nCertificate of lawful use or development\n\n43.(1)\nA person who wishes to ascertain whether any operations which have\nbeen carried out in, on, over or under any land, or any existing use of buildings\nor other land or any other matter related to the development of land, is lawful,\nmay apply to the Chief Town Planner for that purpose, specifying the location of\nthe land and describing the operations or use or other matter in question.\n\nFor the purposes of this Act, any operations or material change in the use\n\n(2)\nof land are lawful at any time if\n\n(a)\n\nsuch  operations  or  uses  do  not  constitute  development  within  the\nmeaning of this Act;\n\n\f61\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nthe development is authorised by a grant of planning permission and\ncomplies with any conditions subject to which such permission was\ngranted;\n\nthe development is permitted under a development order and complies\nwith any conditions and limitations subject to which such permission\nwas granted;\n\nno enforcement action may be taken with respect to the carrying out of\nthe development, or any breach of the conditions or limitations subject\nto  which  such  development  was  permitted,  because  the  time  for\nenforcement action in respect of any such breach of planning control\nhas expired; or\n\n(e)\n\nthe  operations  or  use  do  not  contravene  the  requirements  of  an\nenforcement notice in force.\n\nWhere  on  an  application  under  this  section,  the  Chief  Town  Planner  is\n(3)\nsatisfied that the operations or use of the land described in the application are\nlawful, the Chief Town Planner shall issue a certificate to that effect, and in any\nother case refuse the application.\n\n(4)\n\nA certificate under this section shall\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nspecify the land to which it relates;\n\ndescribe the operations or use or any other matter in question;\n\ngive reasons for determining that the operations or use or other matter\nis lawful; and\n\n(d)\n\nspecify the date of the application and the certificate.\n\nThe lawfulness of any operations, use or other matter for which a certificate\n(5)\nis in force under this section shall be conclusively presumed in any proceedings\nwhatsoever.\n\n\f62\n\n(6)\nAn appeal lies to the Tribunal under Part XI against the refusal of the Chief\nTown  Planner  to  issue  a  certificate  of  lawful  use  or  development  under  this\nsection.\n\nPART V\n\nBUILDING, ENGINEERING AND SUBDIVISON PLANS\n\nBuilding plans\n\n44.(1)\nAn application for planning permission for building operations may\nbe  submitted  by  the  applicant,  or  an  agent  for  the  applicant,  but,  subject  to\nsubsection (3), building plans included in an application for planning permission\nshall  be  signed  and  stamped  by  a  registered  professional  architect  or  civil\nengineer.\n\nA  registered  professional  architect  or  engineer  who  signs  and  stamps\n(2)\nbuilding plans included in an application for planning permission is liable for\nensuring  that  such  plans  comply  with  the  Building  Code  and  Building\nRegulations in force, if any.\n\nA person who is not a registered professional architect or engineer may\n(3)\nprepare  and  sign  building  plans  submitted  in  an  application  for  planning\npermission for\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\ndwelling houses and duplex dwellings;\n\nbuildings of not more than 2 storeys containing more than 2 dwelling\nunits but less than 10 dwelling units; or\n\ncommercial buildings of no more than 465 square metres in gross floor\narea and no more than two stories in height.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that the grant of planning\n(4)\npermission under this Act for the carrying out of building operations does not\n\n\f63\n\naffect any requirement for regulatory approval to be obtained in relation to such\nbuildings under any other enactment.\n\nThe Crown is exempt from any liability for negligence arising from the\n(5)\ngrant of planning permission for building operations under this Act, whether the\nbuilding plans submitted in application for planning permission were prepared\nby a registered professional architect or engineer or any other person.\n\nEmergency engineering operations\n\nNothing  in  this  Act  shall  render  unlawful  the  carrying  out  of  any\n45.(1)\nengineering operations which are urgently necessary for coastal conservation or\nsea defence, or in the interest of public safety or the preservation of property,\nprovided  that  an  application  for  planning  permission  to  regularise  the\nunauthorised development is made to the Board, pursuant to section 31, as soon\nas may be practicable after the necessity for the emergency works arises.\n\nWhere such an application is for the retrospective approval of emergency\n(2)\nworks  undertaken  on  the  seabed  or  shoreline  for  the  purposes  of  coastal\nconservation or sea defence, the application shall be accompanied by a certificate\nissued by the Director of the Coastal Zone Management Unit verifying that the\nengineering  operations  carried  out  without  prior  planning  permission  were\nurgently necessary.\n\nSubdivision plans\n\n46.(1)\nAn  application  for  planning  permission  to  sub-divide  land  shall  be\nmade in the manner prescribed by section 26, accompanied by a layout plan of\nthe proposed subdivision drawn to scale and showing\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe boundaries of the land proposed to be subdivided;\n\nthe  locations  and  widths  of  the  proposed  roads  within  the  proposed\nsubdivision and the locations, widths and names of existing roads on\nto which the proposed subdivision abuts;\n\n(c)\n\nthe purpose for which the proposed parcels are to be used;\n\n\f64\n\n(d)\n\nthe existing uses of all adjoining lands;\n\n(e)\n\nthe approximate dimensions and layout of the proposed parcels;\n\n(f)\n\n(g)\n\n(h)\n\n(i)\n\n(j)\n\n(k)\n\nnatural and artificial features such as buildings or other structures or\ninstallations, roads, watercourses, drainage ditches, wetlands, caves,\nsinkholes and wooded areas within or adjacent to the land proposed to\nbe subdivided;\n\nthe nature and porosity of the soil;\n\nexisting contours or elevations as may be required to determine the\ngrade  of  the  highways  and  the  drainage  of  the  land  proposed  to  be\nsubdivided;\n\nthe public services, including water and electricity supply, available or\nto be available to the land proposed to be subdivided;\n\nthe nature and extent of any restrictions affecting the land proposed to\nbe subdivided, including rights of way and other easements; and\n\na copy of the title deed or certificate of title in respect of the parcel of\nland.\n\nWhen the layout plan of the proposed subdivision is being considered by\n\n(2)\nthe Board, regard shall be had, among other material considerations, to\n\n(a)\n\nwhether the plan conforms to the physical development plan for the\narea;\n\n(b)\n\napproved plans for the subdivision of adjacent lands, if any;\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nthe  suitability  of  the  land  for  the  purposes  for  which  it  is  to  be\nsubdivided;\n\nthe  number,  width,  location  and  proposed  grades  and  elevations  of\nroads, and the adequacy thereof, and the roads linking the roads in the\nproposed subdivision with the established road system in the vicinity\nand the adequacy thereof;\n\n\f65\n\n(e)\n\nthe dimensions and shapes of the proposed lots;\n\n(f)\n\n(g)\n\n(h)\n\nthe adequacy of public utilities and services;\n\nconservation of natural resources and flood control;\n\nthe area of land, if any, within the proposed subdivision that, exclusive\nof  roads,  is  to  be  conveyed  or  dedicated  for  public  or  community\npurposes; and\n\n(i)\n\nwhether the proposed subdivision is premature or in the public interest.\n\nThe Board may impose such conditions with respect to the approval of a\n(3)\nplan  of  subdivision  as  are  reasonable,  having  regard  to  the  nature  of  the\ndevelopment  proposed  for  the  subdivision,  including  but  not  limited  to\nrequirements that\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nan area of the land be dedicated for open space purposes in accordance\nwith the provisions of section 47; and\n\nsuch roads within the subdivision be dedicated to the public as the Chief\nTechnical Officer of the Ministry responsible for highways considers\nnecessary.\n\nWithout prejudice to the generality of subsection (3), when the proposed\n(4)\nsubdivision abuts upon an existing highway the Board may, in particular, impose\na condition that sufficient land, other than land occupied by buildings or other\nstructures, be dedicated to provide for the widening of that existing highway to\nsuch  width  as  the  Board,  on  the  advice  of  the  Chief  Technical  Officer  of  the\nMinistry responsible for highways, considers necessary.\n\nReservation of open space\n\n47.(1)\nThe Board may, as a condition subject to which a planning permission\nis granted for the subdivision of land to be laid out in residential building lots,\nrequire the developer to reserve part of the land as an open space.\n\nIf  the  Board  requires  open  space  to  be  reserved  in  accordance  with\n(2)\nsubsection (1), the developer shall carry out any operations required to make it\n\n\f66\n\nfit for the use for which it was reserved, in compliance with any conditions subject\nto which permission was granted.\n\nTransfer of open spaces\n\n48.(1)\nWhen land that has been reserved as an open space has been rendered\nfit  for  the  use  for  which  it  was  reserved  in  accordance  with  section  47,  the\ndeveloper shall transfer the open space to\n\n(a)\n\na body corporate that is representative of the owners of the building\nlots in the subdivision; or\n\n(b)\n\nthe Crown.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that no compensation or\n(2)\npurchase price is payable to the person who was at the date of transfer of title the\nowner of the land with respect to an open space transferred to the Crown or any\nother person pursuant to subsection (1), and no tax is payable with respect to any\nsuch transfer.\n\nA developer who opts to transfer the open space to the Crown, pursuant to\n(3)\nsubsection (1), may be required to enter into a planning obligation agreement\npursuant to section 36 providing for the making of a financial contribution, either\nperiodically or on a specified date, to cover or contribute to the cost of future\nmaintenance of the open space by the Crown, and providing for financial security\nfor ensuring compliance with that obligation.\n\nA completion certificate shall not be issued in respect of any development\n(4)\nto  which  this  section  applies  pursuant  to  section  50  until  the  developer  has\nsubstantially complied with the requirements of subsection (1).\n\nIn order to ensure the preservation and use of the open space for the purpose\n(5)\nfor which it was reserved, the Cabinet may place any land vested in the Crown\npursuant  to  this  section  under  the  management  of  the  National  Conservation\nCommission  established  by  the  National  Conservation  Commission  Act,\nCap. 393 or such other body as it sees fit.\n\n\f67\n\nProvision of services in subdivisions\n\n49.(1)\nWhere any engineering or other operations are necessary or expedient\nfor  the  purpose  of  laying  the  land  out  in  the  manner  in  which  it  is  being\nsubdivided,  the  developer  of  the  land  to  be  subdivided  shall  carry  out  any\noperations on the land that the Board requires for providing infrastructure and\nutilities to service the lots created by the subdivision of the land.\n\nThe operations that the Board may require the developer of the land to\n(2)\ncarry  out  pursuant  to  subsection  (1)  include  the  provision  of  roads,  drains,  a\nsewage  collection,  treatment  and  disposal  works,  water  mains,  fire  hydrants,\nelectricity supply, street lighting and telecommunications services.\n\nAny engineering or other operations required to be carried out under this\n(3)\nsection shall be carried out in the manner and to the standards specified by the\nstatutory bodies, authorities or statutory undertakers having functions and powers\nunder any other enactment with respect to the provision of roads, drains, sewage\ncollection, treatment and disposal works, water mains, fire hydrants, electricity\nsupply, street lighting and telecommunication services (in this Part referred to as\nthe “relevant authorities”) and approved by the relevant authorities prior to the\nissue of a completion certificate issued pursuant to section 50.\n\nCommencement and completion of works\n\n50.(1)\nWhere  planning  permission  has  been  granted  for  building  or\nengineering operations, including but not limited to engineering operations for\nthe provision of infrastructure in subdivisions, no such operations may be carried\nout  until  the  developer  has  given  7  days  notice  in  writing  to  the  Chief  Town\nPlanner of the intention to commence works.\n\nWhere  the  Chief  Town  Planner  has  been  notified  in  writing  by  the\n(2)\ndeveloper that building or engineering operations have been completed to the\nsatisfaction of and approved by the relevant authorities, the Chief Town Planner\nshall  issue  a  completion  certificate  where  the  works  have  been  carried  out  in\n\n\f68\n\naccordance with the approved plans and the terms and conditions of the planning\npermission.\n\nIn  the  case  of  the  subdivision  of  land,  no  transfer  of  parcels  in  the\n\n(3)\nsubdivision may be registered in the Land Registry until\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\na  completion  certificate  for  any  engineering  operations  required  to\nservice parcels in the subdivision has been issued by the Chief Town\nPlanner pursuant to subsection (2);\n\na detailed survey of the subdivision has been carried out by a licensed\nland surveyor and all the boundaries within the subdivision have been\nmarked  out  on  the  ground  in  accordance  with  the Land  Boundaries\n(Land Survey) Regulations, 1993 (S.I. 1993 No. 55); and\n\nthe  survey  plan  of  the  subdivision  iscertified  by  the  licensed  land\nsurveyor has been submitted to the Board for approval and lodged in\nthe Land Registry.\n\nSeverance of a parcel of land\n\n51.(1)\nFor the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that the foregoing\nprovisions of this Part related to the subdivision of land do not apply where an\napplication for planning permission is made\n\n(a)\n\nto subdivide a parcel of land which abuts on to an existing right of way\naccess road or higher class of road, provided that each of the parcels\nto be created\n\n(i)\n\nabuts on to the existing road or right of way;\n\n(ii)\n\nexceeds the minimum parcel size for residential lots;\n\n(iii)\n\nis adequately drained; and\n\n(iv)\n\nhas independent access to a public water supply and electricity\ndistribution lines; or\n\n\f69\n\n(b)\n\nto  make  adjustments  to  the  boundaries  of  parcels  of  land  or  create\nrights of way or other easements over land.\n\nIn  subsection  (1),  “access  road”  has  the  meaning  assigned  to  it  by  the\n\n(2)\nDevelopment Order.\n\nIn every case to which this section applies, after planning permission has\n(3)\nbeen granted, a survey plan of the approved subdivision, stamped and signed by\nthe licensed land surveyor shall be submitted to the Board for approval before\nbeing lodged in the Land Registry.\n\nPART VI\n\nPROTECTION OF THE CULTURAL AND NATURAL HERITAGE\n\nInterpretation of this Part\n\n52.\nserved under this Part, unless the context otherwise requires:\n\nIn  this  Part  and  any  regulations,  orders,  or  notices  made,  given  or\n\n“cultural heritage” includes\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nmonuments namely buildings and other architectural works, works of\nmonumental  sculpture  and  painting,  elements  or  structures  of  an\narcheological nature, inscriptions, cave dwellings and combinations of\nfeatures,  which  are  of  outstanding  value  from  the  point  of  view  of\nhistory, art or science;\n\ngroups of buildings namely groups of separate or connected buildings\nwhich, because of their architecture, their homogeneity or their place\nin the landscape, are of outstanding value from the point of view of\nhistory, art or science; and\n\n(c)\n\nsites namely works of man or the combined works of nature and of\nman, and areas including archeological sites which are of outstanding\n\n\f70\n\nvalue  from  the  historical,  aesthetic,  ethnological  or  anthropological\npoints of view; and\n\n“natural heritage” includes terrestrial and marine\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nnatural  features  consisting  of  physical  and  biological  formations  or\ngroups of such formations, which are of outstanding value from the\naesthetic or scientific point of view;\n\ngeological and physiological formations and precisely delineated areas\nwhich constitute the habitat of threatened species of animals and plants\nof outstanding value from the point of view of science or conservation;\n\n(c)\n\nnatural sites or precisely delineated natural areas of outstanding value\nfrom the point of view of science, conservation or natural beauty.\n\nListing of cultural heritage buildings, monuments and sites\n\nThe Minister shall cause to be compiled lists of buildings, monuments\n53.(1)\nand sites of prehistoric, historic or architectural merit or interest, or may adopt,\nwith or without modifications, any such lists compiled by the Barbados National\nTrust or other bodies or persons, and may amend any lists so compiled from time\nto time.\n\nBefore the Minister compiles, adopts or amends any list under this section,\n\n(2)\nthe Board shall cause reasonable steps to be taken to ensure that\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nadequate  publicity  is  given  to  the  proposed  listing  of  any  building,\nmonument or site; and\n\nthe owner and occupier of the building or land and any other person\nwho wishes to make any objections or representations with respect to\nthe proposed listing of any building, monument or site, is invited and\ngiven an adequate opportunity to do so.\n\nAny objections or representations made with respect to the proposal shall\n(3)\nbe taken into account by the Minister in deciding whether the building, monument\nor site should be listed.\n\n\f71\n\n(4)\nAs soon as may be practicable after the inclusion of any building or other\nmonument or site on any list compiled or adopted under subsection (1), or any\namendments to a list have been made, the Board shall serve notice on every owner\nand occupier of the building or other monument or land stating that the building\nor other monument or site has been included in or removed from the list, as the\ncase may be, and the Minister shall cause an order (in this Act referred to as a\n“Cultural  Heritage  Preservation  Order”)  listing  the  affected  buildings,\nmonuments or sites to be published in the Official Gazette and a daily newspaper\nin general circulation in Barbados.\n\nThe Chief Town Planner shall make an up to date copy of the list of cultural\n(5)\nheritage  buildings,  monuments  and  sites  published  in  the  Official  Gazette\navailable by inspection by members of the public, free of charge during normal\nbusiness hours, at the office of the Department, and shall publish an electronic\ncopy of the list on the internet.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that no compensation shall\n(6)\nbe  payable  to  the  owner  of  any  property  included  in  a  Cultural  Heritage\nPreservation  Order  which  depreciates  in  open  market  value  as  a  result  of  the\nrestrictions placed thereby on its use or development.\n\nEffect of listing\n\nSubject  to  this  section,  no  person  shall  execute  any  works  for  the\n54.(1)\ndemolition  or  alteration  of  a  listed  building,  monument  or  site,  except  minor\nworks which would not materially affect its character, whether or not such works\nwould ordinarily constitute development or permitted development under this\nAct, without applying for and receiving planning permission.\n\nWhen the Board receives an application for planning permission for any\n(2)\nproposed works under subsection (1), the Board shall consult with the Barbados\nNational  Trust  andsuch  other  bodies  or  persons  having  special  knowledge  of\nbuildings, monuments and sites of prehistoric, historic or architectural merit or\ninterest, as may be specified by direction of the Minister, before granting planning\npermission for the execution of the proposed works.\n\n\f72\n\n(3)\nSubject to subsection (4), a person who executes or causes to be executed\nany work for the demolition or alteration of a listed building, monument or the\ndisturbance of a listed site for which the Board has not granted prior planning\npermission or in breach of any condition subject to which the Board granted such\npermission, is guilty of an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine\nof $500 000 or 10 years imprisonment or both.\n\nNothing in this section shall render unlawful the execution of any works\n(4)\nwhich  are  urgently  necessary  in  the  interests  of  safety  or  health  or  for  the\npreservation of a listed building, monument or site, or of neighbouring property,\nprovided  that  an  application  for  planning  permission  to  regularise  the\nunauthorised development is made to the Board, pursuant to section 31, as soon\nas may be practicable after the necessity for the work arises.\n\nAn application for the retrospective approval of works to a listed building\n(5)\nor other monument or site, made pursuant to subsection (4), shall be accompanied\nby a certificate issued by a registered professional architect or engineer verifying\nthat the building or engineering operations carried out without prior planning\npermission were urgently necessary.\n\nInterim protection\n\n55.(1)\nWhere  it  appears  to  the  Minister  to  be  expedient  to  make  urgent\nprovision for the preservation of any unlisted building, monument or site, the\nMinister may by order (in this Act referred to as an “Interim Listing Order”)\npublished in the Official Gazette and a daily newspaper in Barbados, restrict the\ndemolition, alteration or extension of that building, monument or disturbance of\nthat site.\n\n(2)\n\nAn Interim Listing Order shall\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nspecify the building or other monument or site to which it applies;\n\nstate the effect of the order and the date on which it comes into force;\nand\n\n\f73\n\n(c)\n\ninvite  the  owners  and  occupiers  of  the  building  or  land  to  which  it\napplies to make any objections or representations with respect to the\norder within 28 days after it comes into force.\n\n(3)\n\nA copy of the Interim Listing Order shall\n\n(a)\n\nbe posted or affixed in a prominent place on the building or land to\nwhich it applies; and\n\n(b)\n\nserved on every owner and occupier of the property to which it applies.\n\nAn Interim Listing Order remains in force for a period of 6 months and\n(4)\nceases to have any effect at the end of that period unless the building, monument\nor site to which it applies is listed by the Minister before the end of that period.\n\nWhen an Interim Listing Order is in force with respect to any building,\n(5)\nmonument or site, the provisions of this Act have effect in relation to it as if that\nbuilding, monument or site were a listed building, monument or site.\n\nWhere  any  works  have  been  carried  out  in  contravention  of  an  Interim\n(6)\nListing Order, the Minister may require the restoration of the affected building\nor other monument or site to its former state.\n\nWhere, after an Interim Listing Order has been issued, the Minister decides\n(7)\nnot to list the building, monument or site to which the order relates, the Minister\nshall not serve a fresh Interim Listing Order with respect to the same building,\nmonument or site within a period of 12 months from the date when the previous\nnotice ceased to have effect.\n\nConservation and rehabilitation of listed buildings, monuments and\nsites\n\n56.(1)\nEvery owner and occupier of a listed building, monument or site is\nresponsible for the conservation and rehabilitation of that building, monument\nor site.\n\nThe Board shall, as far as practicable, assist the owners and occupiers of\n(2)\nlisted  buildings,  monuments  and  sites  in  procuring  financial  and  technical\n\n\f74\n\nassistance  for  the  purposes  of  the  conservation  and  rehabilitation  of  such\nbuildings, monuments or sites.\n\nWhere any works have been carried out on a listed building, monument or\n(3)\nsite in contravention of a Cultural Heritage Preservation Order or Interim Listing\nOrder, the Board may serve on the owner or occupier a notice requiring that such\nsteps as may be specified in the notice for restoring the building, monument or\nsite to its former state be taken within such period as may be so specified.\n\nWhere the owner or occupier of a listed building, monument or site neglects\n(4)\nor refuses to comply, within the specified time, with the requirements of a notice\nserved pursuant to subsection (3)\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe Board may, enter upon the premises and take the steps required to\nconserve  or  rehabilitate  the  listed  building,  monument  or  site  and\nrecover as a simple contract debt in any court any expenses reasonably\nincurred for these purposes from the owner of the land; or\n\nthe Crown may compulsorily acquire the building, monument or site\nin  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Land  Acquisition  Act,\nCap. 228.\n\nHeritage Conservation Areas\n\n57.(1)\nThe Minister may by order (in this Act referred to as a “designation\norder”) published in the Official Gazette, designate any area containing a group\nof separate or connected buildings which, because of their history, architecture,\nhomogeneity or place in the landscape, are of outstanding cultural heritage value,\nincluding such other land in the vicinity of that group of buildings as is necessary\nto provide a peripheral protection belt or buffer zone, as an Heritage Conservation\nArea.\n\nBefore making a designation order pursuant to subsection (1), the Minister\n\n(2)\nshall cause to be taken reasonable steps to ensure that\n\n(a)\n\nadequate  publicity  is  given  to  the  proposed  designation  of  the  area,\nincluding where appropriate the holding of a public meeting; and\n\n\f75\n\n(b)\n\nthe owners and occupiers of buildings and land in the area, and any\nother person who wishes to make objections or representations with\nrespect to the proposed designation of the area, are invited and given\nan adequate opportunity to do so.\n\nThe Minister shall take any objections or representations made with respect\n(3)\nto the proposal are taken into account in deciding whether the area should be\ndesignated.\n\nThe Minister shall, in a designation order, specify restrictions or conditions\n(4)\nfor the protection of buildings and other land within a Heritage Conservation\nArea.\n\nAny person who, being the owner or occupier of a building or other land\n(5)\nwithin a Heritage Conservation Area, contravenes the restrictions or conditions\nfor  the  protection  of  buildings  or  other  land  within  that  area  specified  in  the\ndesignation order, is guilty of an offence and is liable on summary conviction to\na fine of $250 000 or 5 years imprisonment or both.\n\nNothing in this section shall render unlawful the execution of any works\n(6)\nwhich  are  urgently  necessary  in  the  interests  of  safety  or  health  or  for  the\npreservation of a building or other land within a Heritage Conservation Area,\nprovided  that  an  application  for  planning  permissions  to  regularise  the\nunauthorised development is made to the Board, pursuant to section 31 as soon\nas may be practicable after the necessity for the work arises.\n\nAn application for the retrospective approval of works to a building or other\n(7)\nland, made pursuant to subsection (6) shall be accompanied by a certificate issued\nby a registered professional architect or engineer verifying that the building or\nengineering  operations  carried  out  without  prior  planning  permission  were\nurgently necessary.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that no compensation is\n(8)\npayable  to  the  owner  of  any  property  within  an  area  declared  as  a  Heritage\nConservation Area which depreciates in open market value as a result of any\nrestriction placed on its use or development by the designation order.\n\n\f76\n\nProtection of Natural Heritage\n\n58.(1)\nThe  Minister  may  cause  to  be  compiled,  and  from  time  to  time\namended, lists of places of natural beauty or natural interest, including submarine\nand subterranean areas, and their flora and fauna.\n\nWhere  the  Minister  is  of  the  view  that  it  is  desirable  to  afford  special\n(2)\nprotection to any area on a list compiled under subsection (1), the Minister may\nby order (in this Act referred to as a “protected area declaration”) published in\nthe Official Gazette declare that area to be a protected area.\n\nBefore making an order pursuant to subsection (2), the Minister shall take\n\n(3)\nreasonable steps to ensure that\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nadequate publicity is given to the proposed declaration within the area\nwhich it proposes to protect, including if appropriate the holding of a\npublic meeting;\n\npersons  who  may  wish  to  make  representations  with  respect  to  the\nproposed declaration are invited and given an adequate opportunity to\nmake representations on the proposal; and\n\n(c)\n\nany  representations  made  on  the  proposal  are  taken  into  account  in\ndeciding whether the order should be made.\n\n(4)\n\nAn order made under subsection (2) may\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nauthorise the carrying out within the protected area of such works as\nmay be expedient for the protection or rehabilitation of the environment\nin the area;\n\nrequire  that  an  environmental  impact  assessment  be  carried  out  in\nrespect of every application for development within the area;\n\nrestrict or prohibit development, or development of any class, within\nthe area;\n\n\f77\n\n(d)\n\n(e)\n\nprovide  for  the  control  over  the  use  of  land  within  the  area  for  the\npurposes of agriculture, forestry or fisheries; or\n\nrestrict or prohibit the entry of persons into the area or the movement\nof persons or the carrying out of activities by persons within the area.\n\nAny person who, being the owner or occupier of land in relation to which\n(5)\na protected area declaration is in force, contravenes any restrictions, prohibitions\nor controls on the use of such land specified in the order or any other person who\nenters  upon  such  land  and  carries  out  any  restricted  or  prohibited  activity  in\ncontravention  of  the  order  is  guilty  of  an  offence  and  is  liable  on  summary\nconviction to a fine of $100 000 or 2 years imprisonment or both.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that no compensation shall\n(6)\nbe payable to the owner of any land within an area declared as a protected area\nwhich depreciates in open market value as a result of any restriction placed on\nits use or development by the protected area declaration.\n\nTree preservation orders\n\n59.(1)\nWhere it appears to the Minister that it is expedient in the interests of\namenity, soil conservation or the recovery or rehabilitation of areas degraded by\nthe clearance of vegetation, fire or any natural hazard event, to make provision\nfor the preservation of trees, groups of trees or woodlands in any part of Barbados,\nthen subject to this section, the Minister may for that purpose make an order (in\nthis  Act  referred  to  as  a  “tree  preservation  order”)  with  respect  to  such  trees,\ngroups of trees or woodlands as may be specified in the order.\n\n(2)\n\nProvision may be made in any tree preservation order for\n\n(a)\n\nfor prohibiting (subject to any exemption specified in the order) the\nfelling, topping, lopping, or wilful damage to or destructions of trees,\nexcept with the consent of the Board, and for any such consent to be\ngranted subject to conditions;\n\n\f78\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nfor securing the replanting, in such manner as may be prescribed by or\nunder the order, of any part of a wooded area which is felled in the\ncourse of any operations permitted by or under the order; and\n\nfor  applying  in  relation  to  any  such  consent  under  the  order  and  to\napplications for such consent, any of the provisions of Part IV relating\nto  permission  to  develop  land  and  to  such  applications  for  such\npermission, as may be specified in the order.\n\nEvery tree preservation order shall define the position of the group of trees\n(3)\nor woodlands to which it relates and for that purpose shall include a map of a\nscale which shows definitively the boundaries of the area protected, or shall refer\nto such a map kept for inspection at the Department.\n\nSubsections (2), (3) and (4) of section 53 apply mutatis mutandis to the\n(4)\nmaking of tree preservation orders as they apply to the listing of cultural heritage\nbuildings, monuments and sites.\n\nWithout limiting the other exemptions for which provision may be made\n(5)\nby a tree preservation order, no such order applies to the cutting down, topping\nor lopping of trees by a statutory undertaker in compliance with any obligation\nimposed or in the exercise of any power conferred on them by any Act, statutory\ninstrument or other enactment.\n\nAny  person  who  contravenes  a  tree  preservation  order  is  guilty  of  an\n(6)\noffence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine of $50 000 and in the case\nof a continuing offence, to a further fine of $1000 for every day after the first day\nduring which the contravention is so continued.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that no compensation shall\n(7)\nbe payable to the owner of any tree, group of trees or woodland with respect to\nany loss or expense incurred in consequence of the measures to preserve such\ntrees imposed by a tree preservation order.\n\nThis section takes effect subject to the provisions of the Cultivation of Trees\n(8)\nAct, Cap. 390 and the Trees (Preservation) Act, Cap. 397, governing licences and\npermits to cut down trees.\n\n\f79\n\nPlanning permission to include provisions concerning trees\n\n60.(1)\nWhenever it is appropriate, in granting planning permission for any\ndevelopment,  the  Board  shall  ensure  that  adequate  provision  is  made  by  the\nimposition of conditions for the preservation or planting of trees.\n\nWhere any planning permission is granted subject to conditions for the\n(2)\npreservation  or  planting  of  trees,  the  Board  may  require  the  applicant,  before\ncommencing the development permitted thereby, to deposit in a special account\nin the Treasury an amount of money specified by the Board as security against\nany failure to preserve or plant such trees.\n\nWhere an applicant fails to do anything in respect of which a deposit is\n(3)\nmade under subsection (2), the Board may authorise the Chief Town Planner to\nenter  upon  the  land  and  cause  such  thing  to  be  done  in  accordance  with  the\nplanning permission and deduct the costs thereof from the amount of the deposit.\n\nWhere there is an unexpended balance on the account after a deduction is\n(4)\nmade under subsection (3), that balance shall be repaid to the applicant by the\nAccountant-General, upon being made to the Accountant-General accompanied\nby  proof  that  the  required  measures  for  the  preservation  or  planting  of  trees\ndevelopment  have  been  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  conditions  of  the\nplanning permission.\n\nPreservation of amenity\n\n61.(1)\nWhere it appears to the Chief Town Planner that the amenity of any\npart of Barbados is, or is likely to be, despoiled by the condition of any building,\nvacant site or other open land, then, the Board may serve on the owner or occupier\nof  the  building  or  other  land  a  notice  (in  this  Act  referred  to  as  an  “amenity\nnotice”) requiring that such steps to remediate the condition of the building or\nother land as may be specified in the notice be taken within such period as may\nbe specified in the notice.\n\n\f80\n\n(2)\nSubject to subsection (2) of section 63, an amenity notice under this section\ntakes effect at the end of such period, not being less than 28 days after the services\nof the notice, as may be specified in the notice.\n\n(3)\nA person who fails to comply with an amenity notice served on them under\nthis section is guilty of an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine\nof $50 000 and in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine of $1000 for\nevery day after the first say during which the failure to comply is continued.\n\nWhere a person on whom an amenity notice is served under this section\n(4)\nfails to comply with the notice, the Board may authorise the Chief Town Planner\nto enter upon the land with such assistance as may be necessary and take such\nmeasures or do such work as is necessary to effect compliance with the notice.\n\nAny expenses incurred by the Chief Town Planner in respect of anything\n(5)\ndone under subsection (4)  are a debt due to the Crown from the person on whom\nthe notice has been served, which the Crown may recover as a civil debt in a court\nof competent jurisdiction.\n\nFixed Penalty Notices\n\n62.(1)\nWithout prejudice to the rights of the Board to take any other steps\nunder this Act, where the owner or occupier of land commits an offence under\nthis Part, the Chief Town Planner may give that person a fixed penalty notice\ncharging that person with the commission of the offence and requiring them to\npay a fixed penalty for the offence within the time specified in the notice, or to\nappear at the court of law specified in the notice on the date and time specified\ntherein to answer the offence charged.\n\nA fixed penalty notice given under subsection (1) shall be in the prescribed\n\n(2)\nform, signed by the Chief Town Planner and specify\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe name and address of the person liable for the alleged offence to\nwhom the notice is given;\n\nthe date, time and place at which the notice was given to the person\nliable for the alleged offence;\n\n\f81\n\n(c)\n\nthe section of this Act creating the alleged offence and such particulars\nof  the  offence  as  are  required  under  the  Magistrates  Court  Act,\nCap. 116A;\n\n(d)\n\nthe date by which the fixed penalty is payable, which shall be 10 days\nfrom the date of the notice;\n\n(e)\n\nthe amount of the fixed penalty;\n\n(f)\n\n(g)\n\nthe clerk of the court to whom and the address at which or to which the\nfixed penalty may be pain or remitted; and\n\nthe address of the Magistrates’ Court at which the person is required\nto appear to answer the charge, in the event that the fixed penalty is not\npaid within the specified time, and the date and time at which the person\nis required to appear at the said court.\n\nThe Chief Town Planner shall send a duplicate copy of the fixed penalty\n(3)\nnotice to the clerk of the court with jurisdiction over the area in which the offence\nis alleged to have been committed and the said copy of the notice is deemed to\nbe a complaint within the meaning of the Magistrates’ Court Act, Cap. 116A.\n\nPayment of the fixed penalty must be made to the clerk of the court having\n(4)\njurisdiction over the area in which the offence is alleged to have been committed\nwithin  the  time  specified  therein  and,  when  the  fixed  penalty  is  duly  paid  in\naccordance with the notice, the person named in the notice is not liable to be\ncontinued of the offence specified on the notice.\n\nNotwithstanding any enactment to the contrary, the fixed penalty notice\n(5)\ngiven to the person is liable for the alleged offence is, from the expiration of the\ntime specified therein for payment of the fixed penalty, deemed to be a summons\nissued in accordance with the Magistrates’ Court Act, Cap. 116A.\n\nWhere the fixed penalty is not paid within the time specified in the notice,\n(6)\nproceedings in respect of the offence specified in the notice shall proceed in the\nmanner specified in the Magistrates’ Court Act, Cap. 116A.\n\n\f82\n\n(7)\nThe  Minister  may  make  regulations  subject  to  negative  resolution,\nproviding  for  any  matter  incidental  to  the  operation  of  this  section,  and  in\nparticular for prescribing\n\n(a)\n\nthe form of fixed penalty notice to be given by the Chief Town Planner;\nand\n\n(b)\n\nthe fixed penalty payable for each offence under this Part.\n\nAppeals under this Part\n\nAny person aggrieved by a decision of the Board made under this Part\n63.(1)\nmay, within 28 days of the date of that decision, appeal against that decision to\nthe Tribunal in accordance with Part XI, setting out the grounds upon which the\nappeal is made.\n\nA person upon whom a notice under section 56(3) is served, or any other\n(2)\nperson having a interest in the building, monument or site to which the notice\nrelates, may, at any time within the period specified in the notice at the end of\nwhich it is to take effect, appeal to the Tribunal against the notice on any of the\nfollowing grounds\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nthat the works to which the notice relates were not, or were not wholly,\nworks in contravention of the provisions of section 56(1);\n\nthat the works to which the notice relates were urgently necessary in\nthe interests of health and safety or for the preservation of the listed\nbuilding,  monument  or  site,  or  of  neighboring  property  and  an\napplication  has  been  made  to  the  Board  in  accordance  with  section\n54(3);\n\nthat  the  requirements  of  the  notice  exceed  what  is  necessary  for\nrestoring  the  building,  monument  or  site  to  its  condition  before  the\nworks to which the notice relates were carried out;\n\nthat the period specified in the notice as the period within which any\nsteps  required  by  the  notice  to  be  taken  falls  short  of  what  should\nreasonably be allowed; or\n\n\f83\n\n(e)\n\nthat any of the steps required by the notice to be taken would not serve\nthe purpose of restoring the character of the building, monument or site\nto what it was before the works to which the notice relates were carried\nout.\n\nA person upon whom an amenity notice under section 61(1) is served, or\n(3)\nany other person having a interest in the building or land to which the notice\nrelates, may, at any time within the period specified in the notice at the end of\nwhich it is to take effect, appeal to the Tribunal against the notice on either of the\nfollowing grounds\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthat  the  requirements  of  the  notice  exceed  what  is  necessary  for\nremediating the condition of the building, monument or site to preserve\nthe amenity of the area; or\n\nthat the period specified in the notice as the period within which any\nsteps  required  by  the  notice  to  be  taken  falls  short  of  what  should\nreasonably be allowed.\n\nWhen an appeal is brought under this section, the decision or notice to\n(4)\nwhich it relates is of no effect pending the final determination or withdrawal of\nthe appeal.\n\nPART VII\n\nCONTROL OF OUTDOOR ADVERTISEMENTS\n\nAdvertisement Control Regulations\n\n64.(1)\nSubject to this section, the Minister may make regulations under this\nAct for restricting or regulating the display of advertisements in the interest of\namenity  or  public  safety,  hereinafter  referred  to  as  “Advertisement  Control\nRegulations”.\n\n\f84\n\nWithout  restricting  the  generality  of  subsection  (1),  any  Advertisement\n\n(2)\nControl Regulations may provide for:\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\n(e)\n\nregulating  the  dimensions,  materials  appearance  and  position  of\nadvertisements  that  may  be  displayed,  the  sites  on  which  the\nadvertisements may be displayed, and the manner in which they are to\nbe affixed to land;\n\nrequiring the consent of the Board to be obtained for the display of\nadvertisements,  or  of  advertisement  of  any  class  specified  in  the\nregulations;\n\ncharging application and license fees with respect to the processing of\napplications for such consent and for the display of advertisements of\ndifferent types;\n\nfor applying, in relation to any such consent and to applications for\nsuch  consent,  any  of  the  provisions  of  Part  IV  relating  to  planning\npermissions and to applications for such permission, subject to such\nadaptations and modifications as may be specified in the regulations;\nand\n\nfor enabling the Board to require the removal of any advertisement that\nis  being  displayed  in  contravention  of  the  regulations,  or  the\ndiscontinuance of the use for the display of advertisements of any site\nthat is being used for that purpose in contravention of the regulations,\nand for that purpose for applying any of the provisions of Part VIII with\nrespect  to  enforcement  notices,  subject  to  such  adaptations  and\nmodifications as may be specified in the regulations.\n\nAdvertisement Control Regulations made under this Act may direct that\n(3)\nany Act, regulations or bylaws, affecting the display of advertisements in force\non the day when the regulations made under this Act come into operation, do not\napply to the display of advertisements in any area to which the Advertisement\nControl Regulations made under this Act apply.\n\n\f85\n\nExisting outdoor advertisements\n\n65.(1)\nAdvertisement  Control  Regulations  made  under  section  64  may  be\nmade so as to apply to advertisements that are being displayed on the date on\nwhich  the  regulations  come  into  force,  or  to  the  use  for  the  display  of\nadvertisements of any site that was being used for that purpose on that date.\n\n(2)\n\nRegulations made under this section may make exceptions with respect to\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe continued display of any such advertisement as is referred to in\nsubsection (1); and\n\nthe continued use for the display of advertisements of any such site as\nis referred to in subsection (1), during such period as may be prescribed\nby the regulations, and different periods may be so prescribed for the\npurposes of different provisions of the regulations.\n\nSpecial provisions for particular areas\n\nAdvertisement Control Regulations made under this Act may make\n66.\ndifferent provisions with respect to different areas and in particular may make\nspecial provision with respect to areas defined in the regulations as areas which\nrequire special protection on the grounds of amenity.\n\nExercise of advertisement control powers\n\n67.\n\nIn exercising the powers conferred on it by this Part the Board shall\n\n(a)\n\nin  the  interests  of  amenity,  determine  the  suitability  of  sites  for  the\ndisplay  of  advertisements  having  regard  to  any  development  plan\napplicable to the area and to the general characteristics of the locality\nincluding the presence of any feature of architectural, historic, cultural\nor similar interest and the natural beauty or scenic value of the locality;\nand\n\n(b)\n\nin the interests of public safety, determine the suitability of sites for the\ndisplay of advertisements having regard to the safety of persons who\n\n\f86\n\nmay use any road, dock, harbour or airfield and in particular consider\nwhether any display of advertisements on the site is likely to hinder or\nobscure any road or traffic sign or any aid to navigation by air or water.\n\nSupplementary provisions as to advertisements\n\nWhere\n\nthe  display  of  advertisements\n\nin  accordance  with\n68.(1)\nAdvertisement Control Regulations involves the development of land within the\nmeaning of this Act permission for that development is deemed to be granted by\nvirtue of this section, and no application is necessary in that behalf under the\nprovisions of Part IV.\n\nWithout prejudice to any regulations made under section 104, any person\n(2)\nwho  displays  an  advertisement  in  contravention  of  the  provisions  of  the\nAdvertisement Control Regulations is liable on summary conviction to a fine of\nsuch amount as may be prescribed by the Advertisement Control Regulations,\nnot exceeding $50 000, and, in case of a continuing offence, to a further fine not\nexceeding $1000 for every day after the first day during which the display is so\ncontinued.\n\nFor the purposes of subsection (2) and without restricting the generality\n\n(3)\nthereof, a person is deemed to display an advertisement where\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe advertisement is displayed on the land of which that person is the\nowner or occupier; or\n\nthe advertisement gives publicity to the goods, trade, business or other\nconcerns of that person.\n\nA person is not guilty of an offence under subsection (2) by reason only\n(4)\nthat  an  advertisement  is  displayed  on  land  of  which  they  are  the  owner  or\noccupier, or that their goods, trade, business or other concerns are given publicity\nby  the  advertisement,  where  they  prove  that  it  was  displayed  without  their\nknowledge or consent.\n\n\f87\n\nPART VIII\n\nENFORCEMENT\n\nPower to serve an Enforcement Notice\n\nThe Board may, if it considers it expedient to do so having regard to\n69.(1)\nthe provisions of the physical development plan for the area, if any, and to any\nother  material  considerations,  serve  a  notice  (in  this  Act  referred  to  as  an\n“enforcement notice”) under this section, if it appears to it that\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nany  development  of  land  has  been  carried  out  without  planning\npermission required under Part IV; or\n\nany  development  of  land  has  been  carried  out  in  breach  of  any\nconditions  or  limitations  subject  to  which  planning  permission  is\ngranted  pursuant  to  section  32  or  section  33,  or  by  a  development\norder made under section 23.\n\nAn enforcement notice shall be served within 4 years of the development\n(2)\nbeing carried out or, in the case of non-compliance of any condition or limitation,\nwithin 4 years of the date of the alleged failure to comply.\n\n(3)\n\nAn enforcement notice\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nshall be served on the owner and on the occupier of the land to which\nit relates; and\n\nmay, if the Board thinks fit, be served on any other person having an\ninterest in that land which is materially affected by the notice; and\n\non any other person carrying on activities on the land which are alleged\nto constitute a breach of the planning control, or causing such activities\nto be carried on.\n\nThe fact that the Board fails to serve an enforcement notice on the persons\n(4)\nmentioned in subsection (3) does not invalidate any action or proceedings under\nthe notice against any other of those persons.\n\n\f(5)\n\nAn enforcement notice\n\n88\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nshall specify the development that is alleged to have been carried out\nwithout planning permission, or the matters in respect of which it is\nalleged that the development does not comply with the conditions or\nlimitations subject to which planning permission was granted, as the\ncase may be; and\n\nmay require such steps as are specified in the notice to be taken, within\na  specified  period,  for  restoring  the  land  to  its  condition  before  the\nunauthorised development took place or for securing compliance with\nthe  conditions  or  limitations  subject  to  which  development  was\npermitted, as the case may be, including but not limited to\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\nthe discontinuation of any use of land or the carrying out of any\nbuilding, engineering, mining or other operations on the land; and\n\nthe demolition or alteration of any building, engineering, mining\nor other works on the land.\n\nSubject to this Part, an enforcement notice takes effect on the expiration\n(6)\nof 28 days from the date of service of the notice on either the owner or occupier\nof the land.\n\nCompliance  with  an  enforcement  notice  does  not  discharge  the\n\n(7)\nenforcement notice.\n\nThe Board may at any time revoke an enforcement notice without affecting\n(8)\nthe power to serve another enforcement notice in respect of the same alleged\nbreach of the provisions of this Act.\n\nWhere an enforcement notice is revoked under subsection (8), the Board\n(9)\nshall serve notice of the revocation on every person on whom the enforcement\nnotice was served.\n\n\f89\n\nApplication to retain unauthorised development\n\n70.(1)\nWhere, before the enforcement notice takes effect, an application is\nmade to the Board in accordance with section 31 for the retention on land of any\nbuildings  or  works  or  the  continuance  of  any  use  of  the  land  to  which  the\nenforcement notice relates, the operation of the enforcement notice is suspended\npending the determination of that application.\n\nWhere the Board grants planning permission for the retention on land of\n(2)\nbuildings or other works or for the continuation of a use of land to which the\nenforcement notice relates, the enforcement notice ceases to have effect in so far\nas it requires steps to be taken for the demolition or alteration of those buildings\nor works or the discontinuance of that use, as the case may be.\n\nWhere on an application made under this section the Board agrees to vary\n(3)\nsome condition or limitation subject to which planning permission was granted,\nthe enforcement notices ceases to have effect in so far as it requires steps to be\ntaken to comply with that condition or limitation.\n\nStop notice\n\n71.(1)\nWhere the Board has served an enforcement notice in respect of any\nland,  the  Board  may,  at  any  time  before  the  enforcement  notice  takes  effect,\nsubject to any direction given by the Minister, serve a further notice (in this Act\nreferred to as a “stop notice”) prohibiting any person on whom the stop notice is\nserved from carrying out or continuing any building, engineering, mining or other\noperations on the land, being activities either alleged in the enforcement notice\nto constitute a breach of planning control or so closely associated therewith as to\nconstitute substantially the same development.\n\nA stop notice served under subsection (1) shall contain a reference to, and\n(2)\nhave annexed to it, a copy of the enforcement notice served in respect of the\nunauthorised development of land to which the stop notice relates.\n\n\f90\n\n(3)\nA stop notice may be served by the Board on any person who has an interest\nin  the  land  or  appears  to  the  Board  to  be  concerned  with  the  carrying  out  or\ncontinuance of any unauthorised operations thereon.\n\n(4)\n\nA stop notice\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\ntakes effect from the date of its service; and\n\nwithout affecting subsection (5), ceases to have effect when\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\nthe enforcement notice to which it relates is revoked by the Board\nunder section 69(8) or quashed by a court of law;\n\npermission is granted for the retention of the building, works or\nother operations in accordance with section 70;\n\n(iii)\n\na person is convicted of an offence under section 74; or\n\n(iv)\n\nthe Chief Town Planner enters on the land in accordance with\nsection 75.\n\nThe Board may at any time revoke a stop notice (without prejudice to their\n(5)\npower to serve another) by serving notice to that effect on the person on whom\nthe stop notice was served and the stop notice ceases to have effect as from the\ndate of withdrawal.\n\nWhere a stop notice is revoked under subsection (5), the Board shall serve\n\n(6)\nnotice of the revocation on every person on whom the stop notice was served.\n\nWhere a stop notice takes effect in relation to works being carried out by\n(7)\na person (hereinafter referred to as “the contractor”) under a contract with another\nperson  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  “the  developer”),  and  the  works  are\ndiscontinued by the contractor in compliance with the notice, the developer is\nunder  the  same  liability  in  contract  as  if  the  operations  were  discontinued  on\ninstructions given to the contractor by the developer in breach of contract, unless\nthe contract explicitly provides to the contrary.\n\n\f91\n\nAppeals against Enforcement and Stop Notices\n\n72.(1)\nBefore the enforcement notice takes effect, any person on whom the\nnotice is served who is aggrieved by the enforcement notice or, where a stop\nnotice has also been served, the stop notice, may lodge an appeal to a Judge in\nchambers,  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  rules  of  court,  against  the\nenforcement notice or the stop notice or both such notices on any of the following\ngrounds\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\n(e)\n\n(f)\n\nthat  what  is  assumed  in  the  enforcement  notice  to  constitute\ndevelopment  did  not  constitute  or  involve  development  within  the\nmeaning of this Act;\n\nthat  planning  permission  has  been  granted  for  the  development  to\nwhich the enforcement notice relates under Part IV;\n\nthat the development is of a class of permitted development specified\nin a development order made under section 23;\n\nthat  the  development  complies  with  the  conditions  or  limitations\nsubject to which permission for the development was granted;\n\nthat the enforcement notice was not served within the period of 4 years\nspecified in section 69(2);\n\nthat  the  requirements  of  the  enforcement  notice  exceed  what  is\nreasonably necessary for restoring the land to its condition before the\ndevelopment in question took place or, as the case may be, for securing\ncompliance with the conditions or limitations to which the enforcement\nnotice relates;\n\n(g)\n\nthat the period specified in the enforcement notice as the period within\nwhich any steps are to be taken falls short of what should reasonably\nbe allowed;\n\n\f92\n\n(h)\n\nthat the enforcement notice or the stop notice, as the case may be, was\nnot served on the appellant in accordance with the provisions of section\n97; or\n\n(i)\n\nthat there are fundamental defects or errors in the enforcement notice\nor the stop notice, as the case may be.\n\nWhere an appeal is made under this section, the enforcement notice is of\n\n(2)\nno effect pending the determination or withdrawal of the appeal.\n\nOn an appeal under this section, the Judge may correct any informality,\n(3)\ndefect or error on the face of the enforcement notice, if the Judge is satisfied that\nthe informality, defect or error is not a material one and the correction is not\nprejudicial to the appellant.\n\nWhere a stop notice has been served pursuant to section 71, the hearing of\n(4)\nan appeal against the stop notice or the enforcement notice related to the stop\nnotice is deemed to be a case for urgent hearing by the court.\n\nOn the determination of an appeal under this section, the Judge shall give\n(5)\nreasons for the court’s decision and directions for giving effect to that decision\nincluding, where appropriate, directions or for varying the enforcement notice in\naccordance with subsection (3) or for quashing the enforcement notice or stop\nnotice to which the appeal relates.\n\nWhere  an  enforcement  notice  is  varied  by  the  Judge  or  the  appeal  is\n(6)\ndismissed, the Judge may direct that the enforcement notice does not come into\nforce until such date as ordered by the court, not being less than 28 days from the\ndetermination of the appeal.\n\nOn  the  determination  of  an  appeal  under  this  section,  the  Board  or  the\n(7)\nappellant may appeal to the Court of Appeal against the decision of the Judge in\nchambers.\n\nCompensation for loss due to stop notice\n\n73.(1)\nWhere a stop notice ceases to have effect, a person who at the time\nwhen it was first served had an interest in the land to which it relates is, in any\n\n\f93\n\nof the circumstances mentioned in subsection (2), entitled to be compensated by\nthe Crown in respect of any loss or specific damages directly attributable to the\nprohibition contained in the notice.\n\n(2)\n\nA person is entitled to compensation under subsection (1) where\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nthe enforcement notice to which the stop notice refers is quashed by a\ncourt of law on any of the grounds specified in subsection 72(1);\n\nan allegation in the enforcement notice upon which the prohibition in\nthe stop notice depends is not upheld because the enforcement notice\nis varied in any material way on appeal to a Judge in chambers under\nsection 72;\n\nthe  enforcement  notice  is  revoked  by  the  Board,  otherwise  than  in\nconsequence of the grant or variation of a planning permission pursuant\nto an application to retain the unauthorised development made under\nsection 70;\n\n(d)\n\nthe stop notice is revoked by the Board under section 71(5).\n\nA claim for compensation under this section shall be made to the Crown\n\n(3)\nwithin such time and in such manner as are prescribed by the Minister.\n\nThe loss or specific damages in respect of which compensation is payable\n(4)\nunder this section includes a sum payable by any person for breach of contract\ncaused by the taking of action necessary to comply with prohibition in the stop\nnotice.\n\nCompensation payable under this section shall, in default of agreement, be\n\n(5)\ndetermined by the procedure laid down in the Land Acquisition Act, Cap. 228.\n\nProceedings for non-compliance with notices\n\nWhere by virtue of an enforcement notice any building, engineering,\n74.(1)\nmining or other operations or any use of land is required to be discontinued, or\ncompliance is required with any conditions subject to which development was\npermitted, any person who carries out, or causes or permits those operations to\n\n\f94\n\nbe carried out or that use of land to continue, in contravention of the enforcement\nnotice, is guilty of an offence and is liable on summary conviction to\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\na fine of $100 000; and\n\na further fine of $10 000 a day for every day after the notice comes into\nforce during which the operations were carried on or the use of land\nwas continued in contravention of the enforcement notice.\n\nWithout prejudice to subsection (1), where an enforcement notice has been\n(2)\nserved on a person who, at the time when the notice was served, was the owner\nof the land to which the notice relates, then, if the steps

$200 000.\n\nWhere a person on whom a stop notice is served carries out, or causes or\n(3)\npermits to be carried out any unauthorised building, engineering, mining or other\noperations prohibited by the notice, that person is guilty of an offence and is liable\non summary conviction to:\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\na fine of $500 000; and\n\na further fine of $50 000 for each day after the notice was served during\nwhich the prohibited operations continue.\n\nPower to remove or alter works\n\n75.(1)\nWhere a person on whom an enforcement notice was served fails or\nrefuses to take the steps required by the enforcement notice to remedy the breach\nof planning control within the period specified in the enforcement notice, after\nthe  expiry  of  that  period,  the  Board  without  prejudice  to  their  right  to  take\nsummary proceedings for a fine in respect of the contravention of the enforcement\nnotice and the stop notice, may authorise the Chief Town Planner to enter the\nland with such assistance as may be necessary and take those steps in respect of\nthe unauthorised development to enforce the notice as it may see fit.\n\n\f95\n\n(2)\nWhen  the  Board  has  exercised  any  power  under  subsection  (1),  it  may\nrecover as a civil debt, from the person on whom the notice has been served, those\nexpenses reasonably incurred by it in the exercise of such power, in a court of\ncompetent jurisdiction.\n\nA person who is entitled to appeal against an enforcement notice under\n(3)\nsection  72,  and  has  failed  to  make  such  an  appeal,  is  not  entitled  in  any\nproceedings to dispute the validity of the action taken by the Board or the Chief\nTown  Planner  upon  any  ground  that  could  have  been  entertained  on  such  an\nappeal.\n\nWithout affecting the operation of section 74, a person who, without having\n(4)\nfirst obtained a planning permission, carries out any development on land by way\nof reinstating or restoring buildings or other works that have been demolished or\naltered  in  accordance  with  an  enforcement  notice,  pursuant  to  this  section,  is\nguilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine of

and  removed  by  the  owner  within  7  clear  days  of  the  date  of  their\nremoval.\n\nWhere the Board sells any materials pursuant to subsection (2), the amount\n(3)\nof money yielded by the sale shall be offset against the costs incurred by the\nBoard in any proceedings for debt recovery taken under section 75(2).\n\n\f96\n\nInjunctions\n\nIn addition to any other remedy provided by this Act, the Board may,\n77.\nin any case that it thinks fit, institute a civil action in the Supreme Court for an\ninjunction to prevent any person from violating the provisions of this Act, or to\nenforce any enforcement notice or stop notice.\n\nSaving of existing uses\n\n78.\nNothing contained in this Part shall be construed as requiring planning\npermission to be required for the use of land for the purpose for which it could\nlawfully have been used if the development in respect of which an enforcement\nnotice is served had not been carried out.\n\nEffect of Enforcement Notice on subsequent development\n\n79.(1)\nenforcement notice.\n\nCompliance  with  an  enforcement  notice  does  not  discharge  the\n\n(2)\nWithout  prejudice  to  subsection  (1),  any  provision  of  an  enforcement\nnotice requiring a use of land to be discontinued operates as a requirement that\nit shall be discontinued permanently, to the extent that the use is in contravention\nof Part IV and, accordingly, the resumption of that use at any time after it has\nbeen discontinued in compliance with the enforcement notice is, to that extent,\nin contravention of the enforcement notice.\n\nWithout prejudice to subsection (1), if any development is carried out on\n(3)\nland  by  way  of  reinstating  or  restoring  buildings  or  works  which  have  been\ndemolished  or  altered  in  compliance  with  an  enforcement  notice,  the  notice\n(notwithstanding that its terms are not apt for the purpose) is deemed to apply in\nrelation to the buildings or works as reinstated or restored as it applied to the\nbuildings  or  works  before  they  were  demolished  or  altered  and,  subject  to\nsubsection (4), the provisions of section 75 and 76(1) apply accordingly.\n\nWhere  at  any  time  after  an  enforcement  notice  takes  effect,  the  Board\n(4)\nproposes to take any steps under section 75 with respect to any development is\n\n\f97\n\ncarried by way of reinstating or restoring buildings or works which have been\ndemolished or altered in compliance with an enforcement notice, not less than\n28  days  before  taking  any  such  steps,  the  Board  shall  serve  on  the  owner  or\noccupier of the land a notice of their intention to take such steps.\n\nAny person who, without the grant of planning permission, carries out any\n(5)\ndevelopment on land by way of reinstating or restoring buildings or works which\nhave been demolished or altered in compliance with an enforcement notice, is\nguilty of an offence and is liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine of $250\n000.\n\nExercise of the Board’s discretion to take enforcement action\n\nThe  Board  may  exercise  its  discretion  to  take  enforcement  action\n80.(1)\nunder this Part on a complaint made by the Chief Town Planner or any other\nperson, but every such complaint shall be made to the Board through the Chief\nTown Planner.\n\nEvery complaint concerning a breach of planning control made to the Chief\n(2)\nTown Planner by another person shall be recorded and the Chief Town Planner\nshall inform the complainant in writing of the decision of the Board with respect\nto the exercise of its discretion to take enforcement action in relation to their\ncomplaint.\n\nA document which discloses the identity of a complainant giving
