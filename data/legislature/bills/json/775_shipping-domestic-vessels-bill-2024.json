(3), is forfeited to the port authority\n(4)\nif the person entitled to proceeds or any part thereof fails to claim within one year\nafter the sale of the vessel.\n\nWhen the expenses connected with the raising, removal or destruction of\n(5)\na vessel described in subsection (1) exceeds the value of any property recovered,\nthe excess amount becomes a debt due to the port authority from the person who\nwas the owner of the vessel at the time it was sunk, stranded or abandoned.\n\nRemoval officer\n\n231.(1)\nWhere a vessel is run aground or stranded, or is found in a dangerous\nor hazardous condition, in a port under the control of the port authority, or in or\nnear the approaches thereto, and it appears expedient to the port authority to take\ncharge of the operation of refloating or removing the vessel, it may, subject to\nsubsection (4), appoint an officer to direct the operation.\n\nThe officer so directed is authorised to do all things that in his opinion are\n\n(2)\nnecessary to refloat or remove the vessel.\n\nThe master and all persons present and belonging to the vessel shall obey\n(3)\nthe direction of the authorised person and render him such
