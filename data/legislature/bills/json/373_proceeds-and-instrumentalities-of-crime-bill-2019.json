“the relevant date” is the first day of\n\n(2)\nthe period of 6 years ending with\n\n(a)\n\nthe day on which proceedings for the offence concerned were instituted\nagainst the defendant; or\n\n\f26\n\n(b)\n\nwhere  there  are  2  or  more  offences  and  proceedings  for  them  were\ninstituted against the defendant on different days, the earliest of those\ndays.\n\nWhere the Court determines that section 16 does not apply to a defendant,\n\n(3)\na gift is tainted where it was made by the defendant at any time after\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe date on which the offence concerned was committed; or\n\nwhere his particular criminal conduct consists of 2 or more offences\nand they were committed on different dates, the date of the earliest\noffence.\n\n(4)\n\nFor the purposes of subsection (3)\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nan  offence  which  is  a  continuing  offence  is  committed  on  the  first\noccasion when it is committed; and\n\nthe  defendant’s  particular  conduct  includes  any  conduct  which\nconstitutes offences which the Court has taken into consideration in\ndeciding his sentence for the offence or offences concerned.\n\nA  gift  may  be  a  tainted  gift  whether  it  was  made  before  or  after  the\n\n(5)\ncommencement date.\n\nReferences  to  a  recipient  of  a  tainted  gift  are  to  a  person  to  whom  a\n\n(6)\ndefendant has made the gift.\n\nValue of tainted gifts\n\n10.(1)\ngreater of the following:\n\nThe  value  at  any  time  (“the  material  time”)  of  a  tainted  gift  is  the\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe value, at the time of the gift, of the property given, adjusted to take\naccount of later changes in the value of money;\n\nthe value, at the material time, of the property specified in subsection\n(2).\n\n\f27\n\n(2)\n\nThe property specified for the purposes of subsection (1) is as follows:\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nwhere the recipient holds the property given, the property specified in\nthis subsection is that property;\n\nwhere the recipient holds no part of the property given, the property\nspecified in this subsection is any property which directly or indirectly\nrepresents, in his hands, the property given;\n\nwhere  the  recipient  holds  part  of  the  property  given,  the  property\nspecified in this subsection is that part and any property which directly\nor  indirectly  represents,  in  his  hands,  the  other  part  of  the  property\ngiven.\n\nGeneral and particular criminal conduct\n\nGeneral criminal conduct, with respect to a defendant, means all his\n11.(1)\ncriminal conduct and for the purposes of this definition, it is immaterial whether\nthe conduct occurred, or property constituting a benefit from the conduct was\nobtained, before or after the commencement date.\n\nParticular  criminal  conduct,  with  respect  to  a  defendant,  means  all  his\n\n(2)\ncriminal conduct which constitutes\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nthe offence of which he was convicted;\n\nany other offence or offences of which he was convicted in the same\nproceedings; and\n\nan offence which has been or will be taken into consideration by the\nCourt in sentencing the defendant for the offence specified in paragraph\n(a).\n\nInstitution and conclusion of proceedings and other interpretative\nprovisions\n\n12.(1)\n\nProceedings for an offence are instituted where\n\n(a)\n\na magistrate issues a summons or warrant in respect of the offence; or\n\n\f28\n\n(b)\n\na  person  is  charged  with  the  offence  after  being  taken  into  custody\nwithout a warrant.\n\n(2)\nWhere the application of subsection (1) would result in there being more\nthan one time for the institution of proceedings, the proceedings shall be taken\nto have been instituted at the earliest of those times.\n\n(3)\n\nProceedings for an offence are concluded\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\n(e)\n\nwhen the defendant is acquitted on all counts or every charge against\nhim is dismissed, as the case may be;\n\nwhere the defendant is convicted in the proceedings and the conviction\nis set aside or the defendant is pardoned before a confiscation order is\nmade, when the conviction is set aside or the defendant is pardoned;\n\nwhere  a  confiscation  order  is  made  against  the  defendant  in  the\nproceedings, when the order is satisfied or discharged or when the order\nis set aside and the decision to set aside the order is no longer subject\nto appeal;\n\nwhere the defendant is convicted on one or more counts or charges but\nthe Court decides not to make a confiscation order against him, when\nthe Court’s decision is no longer subject to appeal by the prosecutor;\n\nwhere the defendant is sentenced without the Court having considered\nwhether  or  not  to  proceed  under  section  24  in  his  case,  when  he  is\nsentenced.\n\n(4)\n\nAn application under section 29, 30, 31, 32, 37 or 38 is concluded where\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe Court decides not to make or vary, as the case may be, any order\nagainst the defendant on the application, when it makes the decision;\n\nan order against the defendant is made or varied on the application,\nwhen the order is\n\n(i)\n\nsatisfied or discharged; or\n\n\f29\n\n(ii)\n\nset aside and the decision to set the order aside is no longer subject\nto appeal; and\n\n(c)\n\nthe application is withdrawn, when the prosecutor notifies the Court of\nthe withdrawal of the application.\n\n(5)\n\nA confiscation order is satisfied when no amount is due under it.\n\nAn order is subject to appeal until, disregarding any power of a court to\n(6)\ngrant leave to appeal out of time, there is no further possibility of an appeal on\nwhich the order could be varied or set aside.\n\nApplication for confiscation order or forfeiture order on conviction\n\n13.(1)\n\nWhere a defendant is\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nconvicted by the Court of an offence or offences; or\n\ncommitted  to  the  Court  by  a  magistrate  in  respect  of  an  offence  or\noffences under section 68,\n\nthe Court may, on the application of the prosecutor or on its own motion, make\nall or any of the orders specified in subsection (2).\n\n(2)\n\nThe orders referred to in subsection (1) are:\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nan order confiscating any benefit that the defendant obtained as a result\nof, or in connection with, the commission of the offence or offences;\n\nan order forfeiting any property that is an instrumentality of the offence\nor offences;\n\nan order forfeiting any property that the defendant obtained as a result\nof, or in connection with, the commission of the offence or offences,\nincluding any tainted gift.\n\nWhere  an  application  is  made  to  the  Court  for  an  order  referred  to  in\n(3)\nsubsection (2) in respect of a person’s conviction of an offence, the Court may,\nin determining the application, have regard to the transcript of any proceedings\nagainst the person for the offence.\n\n\f30\n\n(4)\nWhere an application is made for an order referred to in subsection (2) and\nthe Court has not, when the application is made, passed sentence on the person\nfor the offence, the Court may, where it is satisfied that it is reasonable to do so\nin  all  the  circumstances,  defer  passing  sentence  until  it  has  determined  the\napplication for the order.\n\nDivision 2\n\nConfiscation Orders\n\nApplication for confiscation order\n\nWhere the prosecutor intends to apply to the Court for a confiscation\n14.(1)\norder or the Court on its own motion determines that it is appropriate to proceed\nunder section 15 against a defendant\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe prosecutor shall give the defendant no less than 14 days’ written\nnotice of the application; and\n\nthe defendant may appear and adduce evidence at the hearing of the\napplication.\n\nThe prosecutor may, before the final determination of an application for a\n(2)\nconfiscation order, apply to the Court to amend the application to include any\nother property, and the Court may so amend the application where it is satisfied\nthat\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe  property  was  not  reasonably  capable  of  identification  when  the\napplication was originally made; or\n\nnecessary  evidence  became  available  only  after  the  application  was\noriginally made.\n\nWhere  the  prosecutor  intends  to  apply  to  amend  an  application  for  a\n(3)\nconfiscation order against a defendant and the effect of the amendment would be\nto include an additional benefit in the application for the confiscation order the\n\n\f31\n\nprosecutor shall give the defendant no less than 14 days’ written notice of the\napplication to amend.\n\nMaking of confiscation order\n\n15.(1)\nWhere the prosecutor applies to the Court for a confiscation order or\nthe Court on its own motion determines that it is appropriate to proceed under\nthis  section,  the  Court  shall  determine  whether  section  16  applies  in  the\ndefendant’s case, and where it determines that section 16\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\napplies, whether the defendant has benefited from his general criminal\nconduct; or\n\ndoes not apply, whether the defendant has benefited from his particular\ncriminal conduct.\n\nWhere  the  Court  determines  in  accordance  with  subsection  (1)  that  a\n(2)\ndefendant has benefited from his general or particular criminal conduct, the Court\nshall\n\n(a)\n\ndetermine  the  amount  to  be  recovered  from  him  (the  “recoverable\namount”) in accordance with section 17; and\n\n(b)\n\nmake a confiscation order requiring him to pay that amount.\n\nWhere the Court is satisfied that any victim of the defendant’s criminal\n(3)\nconduct  has  instituted,  or  intends  to  institute,  civil  proceedings  against  the\ndefendant in respect of any loss, injury or damage sustained in connection with\nthe defendant’s conduct\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe Court shall treat the duty in subsection (2) as a power; and\n\nthe recoverable amount is such amount as the Court considers just, but\nthe recoverable amount shall not exceed the amount that it would have\nbeen if this subsection did not apply.\n\nThe Court shall determine any question arising under subsection (1) or (2)\n\n(4)\non a balance of probabilities.\n\n\f32\n\nThe Court may postpone the proceedings for a confiscation order under\n\n(5)\nthe procedure set out in section 24.\n\n(6)\nUnless the Court postpones the proceedings for confiscation under section\n24,  it  shall  proceed  under  this  section  before  sentencing  the  defendant  with\nrespect to the offence or offences referred to in section 13(1).\n\nApplication of section 16\n\n16.(1)\n\nThis section applies to a defendant who is convicted of\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\na drug trafficking offence;\n\na money laundering offence;\n\nan offence that constitutes conduct forming part of a course of criminal\nactivity within the meaning of subsection (2); or\n\nan  offence  committed  over  a  period  of  at  least  6  months  and  has\nbenefited from the conduct which constitutes the offence.\n\nFor the purposes of subsection (1)(c), conduct forms part of a course of\n\n(2)\ncriminal activity where the defendant benefited from the conduct and\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nin the proceedings in which he was convicted of an offence in relation\nto the conduct, he was also convicted of at least one other qualifying\noffence; or\n\nhe was convicted on at least one previous occasion in the period of 6\nyears prior to the commencement of the proceedings of at least one\nqualifying offence.\n\nSubsection (1)(b) and (c) do not apply to a defendant where the value of\n(3)\nthe relevant benefit obtained is less than $10 000 or such other amount as may\nbe prescribed by the Minister by Order subject to negative Resolution.\n\n(4)\n\nIn this section\n\n“qualifying offence” means an offence which constitutes conduct from which the\n\ndefendant has benefited;\n\n\f“relevant benefit” means the total benefit from\n\n33\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nall offences comprising the course of criminal activity; and\n\nconduct which constitutes an offence which has been or will be taken\ninto  consideration  by  the  Court  in  sentencing  the  defendant  for  any\noffence specified in paragraph (a).\n\nRecoverable amount\n\n17.(1)\nSubject to this subsections (2) to (6), the recoverable amount for the\npurposes of section 15(2)(a) is an amount equal to the defendant’s benefit from\nthe conduct concerned.\n\nSubsection (3) applies where the defendant proves that the value of the\n(2)\nbenefit under subsection (1) is greater than the amount available to him, being\nthe aggregate of the total of the values, at the time the confiscation order is made,\nof\n\n(a)\n\nall  the  realisable  property  then  held  by  the  defendant  less  the  total\namount payable pursuant to obligations which then have priority; and\n\n(b)\n\nall tainted gifts.\n\nIn the circumstances referred to in subsection (2), the recoverable amount\n\n(3)\nis\n\n(a)\n\nthe amount the defendant proves is available to him in accordance with\nthat subsection; or\n\n(b)\n\na nominal amount, where the amount referred to in paragraph (a) is nil.\n\nFor the purposes of subsection (2), an obligation has priority where it is an\n\n(4)\nobligation of the defendant to pay\n\n(a)\n\nan amount due in respect of a fine or other order of a court which was\nimposed or made on conviction of an offence and at any time before\nthe time the confiscation order is made; or\n\n\f34\n\n(b)\n\na sum which would be included among the preferential debts of the\ndefendant if the defendant’s bankruptcy or, in the case of a company,\nits liquidation, had commenced on the date of the confiscation order.\n\n(5)\nIn subsection (4), “preferential debt” means a debt that, in the bankruptcy\nof an individual or the liquidation of a company, is payable in priority to the debts\nof other creditors.\n\nIn calculating the defendant’s benefit from the conduct concerned for the\n(6)\npurposes of subsection (1), any property in respect of which a recovery order, a\ncash forfeiture order, a listed asset forfeiture order or a forfeiture order is in force\nshall be ignored.\n\nDefendant’s benefit\n\nIn determining, for the purposes of section 15, whether a defendant\n18.(1)\nhas benefited from conduct, and, if so, his benefit from that conduct, the Court\nshall take account of\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nconduct occurring up to the time it makes its determination; and\n\nproperty obtained up to that time.\n\nSubsections (3) to (5) apply where the conduct concerned, for the purposes\n\n(2)\nof section 15, is the defendant’s general criminal conduct.\n\nWhere a confiscation order has previously been made against the defendant\n(3)\nunder this Act or any other enactment, and his benefit for the purposes of that\norder was his benefit from his general criminal conduct\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nhis benefit determined at the time the last confiscation order was made\nagainst him shall be taken for the purposes of this section to be his\nbenefit from his general criminal conduct at that time; and\n\nthe Court shall deduct the aggregate of the amounts ordered to be paid\nunder each confiscation order previously made against the defendant\nunder\n\n(i)\n\nthis Act; and\n\n\f35\n\n(ii)\n\nany other enactment.\n\n(4)\nSubsection (3)(b) does not apply to an amount which has been taken into\naccount  for  the  purposes  of  a  deduction  under  that  subsection  on  any  earlier\noccasion.\n\nThe  reference  to  general  criminal  conduct  in  the  case  of  a  confiscation\n(5)\norder made under any other enactment is a reference to conduct in respect of\nwhich a court is required or entitled to make one or more assumptions for the\npurpose of assessing a person’s benefit from the conduct.\n\nAssumptions to be made where section 16 applies\n\nSubject to subsection (3), where the Court determines under section\n19.(1)\n15(1)  that  section  16  applies  to  the  defendant,  the  Court  shall  make  the\nassumptions specified in subsection (2) for the purposes of determining\n\n(a)\n\nwhether the defendant has benefited from his general criminal conduct;\nand\n\n(b)\n\nhis benefit from the conduct.\n\n(2)\n\nThe assumptions referred to in subsection (1) are that\n\n(a)\n\nany property transferred to the defendant at any time after the relevant\ndate was obtained by him\n\n(i)\n\nas a result of his general criminal conduct; and\n\n(ii)\n\nat the earliest time he appears to have held it;\n\n(b)\n\nany  property  held  by  the  defendant  at  any  time  after  the  date  of\nconviction was obtained by him\n\n(i)\n\nas a result of his general criminal conduct; and\n\n(ii)\n\nat the earliest time he appears to have held it;\n\n(c)\n\nany expenditure incurred by the defendant at any time after the relevant\ndate was met from property obtained by him as a result of his general\ncriminal conduct; and\n\n\f36\n\n(d)\n\nfor the purpose of valuing any property obtained, or assumed to have\nbeen obtained, by the defendant, he obtained the property free of any\nother interests in it.\n\nThe Court shall not make an assumption under subsection (1) in relation\n\n(3)\nto particular property or expenditure where\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe assumption is shown to be incorrect; or\n\nthere would be a serious risk of injustice if the assumption were made.\n\nWhere  the  Court  does  not  make  one  or  more  of  the  assumptions  under\n\n(4)\nsubsection (1), the Court shall state its reasons.\n\nFor the purposes of this section, “the relevant date” is the first day of the\n\n(5)\nperiod of 6 years ending with\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe date when proceedings for the offence concerned were instituted\nagainst the defendant; or\n\nwhere  there  are  2  or  more  offences  and  proceedings  for  them  were\ninstituted on different days, the earliest of those days.\n\nWhere a confiscation order has been made against the defendant under this\n(6)\nAct or any other enactment at any time during the period referred to in subsection\n(5)\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe relevant date is the date when the defendant’s benefit was calculated\nfor the purposes of the last such confiscation order;\n\nthe  assumption  specified  in  subsection  (2)(b)  does  not  apply  to  any\nproperty which was held by him on or before the relevant date.\n\nTime for payment under confiscation order\n\n20.(1)\na confiscation order shall be paid on the making of the order.\n\nSubject to subsections (2) to (5), the amount ordered to be paid under\n\n\f37\n\n(2)\nWhere the defendant shows that he needs time to pay the amount ordered\nto be paid, the Court may make an order allowing payment to be made within a\nperiod not exceeding 6 months after the date of the confiscation order.\n\n(3)\nWhere, on the application of the defendant, the Court is satisfied that there\nare  exceptional  circumstances,  the  Court  may  extend  the  period  specified  in\nsubsection (2).\n\nAn order under subsection (3) may be made after the end of the period\n(4)\noriginally given for payment but shall not be made after the end of the period of\n12 months starting with the date on which the confiscation order was made.\n\nThe Court shall not make an order under subsection (2) or (3) unless it\n\n(5)\ngives the prosecutor an opportunity to make representations to the Court.\n\nThis section and sections 21 and 23 apply where an external order for the\n(6)\nrecovery of a specified sum of money is registered in Barbados subject to the\nfollowing modifications:\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\na reference to a confiscation order shall be treated as a reference to the\nexternal order; and\n\na reference to the date of the confiscation order shall be treated as a\nreference to the date that notice of the registration of the order is given\nto the person affected by it.\n\nInterest on sums unpaid under confiscation order\n\n21.(1)\nWhere the amount required to be paid by a person under a confiscation\norder is not paid when it is required to be paid, the person shall pay interest on\nthe amount unpaid for the period for which it remains unpaid at the rate for the\ntime being applicable to a civil judgment debt.\n\nFor the purposes of subsection (1), no amount is required to be paid under\n\n(2)\na confiscation order where\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nan application has been made under section 20(3);\n\nthe application has not been determined by the Court; and\n\n\f38\n\n(c)\n\nthe period of 12 months starting with the date on which the confiscation\norder was made has not ended.\n\nThe amount of interest payable under this section shall be treated as part\n\n(3)\nof the amount to be paid under the confiscation order.\n\nEffect of confiscation order on Court’s other powers\n\nWhere the Court makes a confiscation order against a defendant, it\n22.(1)\nshall, in respect of any offence of which he is convicted in those proceedings,\ntake account of the confiscation order before\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nimposing a fine on him;\n\nmaking  any  order  involving  any  payment  by  him,  other  than  a\ncompensation order; or\n\nmaking any other order for confiscation, compensation or forfeiture\nunder this Act or any other enactment.\n\nSubject to subsection (1), the Court shall leave the confiscation order out\n\n(2)\nof account in deciding the appropriate sentence for the defendant.\n\n(3)\n\nThe Court shall make an order under subsection (4) where it\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nmakes a confiscation order and a compensation order against the same\nperson in the same proceedings; and\n\nbelieves that the person will not have sufficient means to satisfy both\norders in full.\n\nWhere subsection (3) applies, the Court shall order that such amount of the\n(4)\ncompensation  order  that  it  believes  will  not  be  recoverable  because  of  the\ninsufficiency of the person’s means, be paid out of any sums recovered under the\nconfiscation order.\n\nCourt may order payment by financial institution\n\n23.(1)\nmaintained by the person with a financial institution.\n\nThis section applies to money which is held by a person in an account\n\n\f39\n\n(2)\n\nThis section applies where the following conditions are satisfied:\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\na restraining order has effect in relation to money to which this section\napplies;\n\na confiscation order is made against the person by whom the money is\nheld;\n\nan enforcement receiver has not been appointed; and\n\nany period allowed under section 20 for payment of the amount ordered\nto be paid under the confiscation order has ended.\n\nWhere subsection (2) applies, the Court may order the financial institution\n(3)\nto  pay  the  money  to  the  Court  on  account  of  the  amount  payable  under  the\nconfiscation order.\n\nA financial institution that fails to comply with an order under subsection\n(4)\n(3) is guilty of an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine of $50,000.\n\n(5)\n\nFor the purposes of this section, “financial institution” means\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\na commercial bank, trust company, finance company, merchant bank\nand brokerage house or other deposit-taking institution;\n\na society registered under the Co-operative Societies Act, Cap. 378A;\nand\n\na  building  society  registered  under  the  Building  Societies  Act,\nCap. 377.\n\nPostponement of confiscation proceedings\n\n24.(1)\n\nWhere the Court considers it appropriate to do so, the Court may\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\npostpone  proceedings  under  section  15  for  a  specified  period  (“the\npostponement period”); and\n\nextend the postponement period for a specified period on one or more\noccasions.\n\n\f40\n\n(2)\nUnless the Court is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances, the\npostponement  period,  whether  as  originally  ordered  or  as  extended,  shall  not\nexceed a period of 2 years from the date of the conviction of the defendant.\n\nWhere the defendant appeals against his conviction, the Court may, on that\n\n(3)\naccount\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\ndefer  making  any  determination  as  to  postponement  mentioned  in\nsubsection (1) for such period as it may specify; or\n\nwhere it has already exercised its powers under this section to postpone,\nextend the postponement period.\n\nUnless the Court is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances, any\n(4)\npostponement or extension under subsection (3), shall not exceed a period of 3\nmonths from the date on which the appeal is determined or otherwise disposed\nof.\n\n(5)\n\nA postponement or extension under subsection (1) or (3) may be made\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\non the application of the defendant or the prosecutor; or\n\nby the Court of its own motion.\n\nAn application to extend the postponement period may be granted after the\n(6)\npostponement period has ended, provided that the application is made before it\nends.\n\nEffect of postponement\n\n25.(1)\nSubject  to  subsection  (2),  where  the  Court  exercises  its  power  to\npostpone proceedings under section 24, it may nevertheless proceed to sentence\na defendant in respect of the offence or any of the offences concerned.\n\nIn sentencing the defendant in respect of the offence, or any of the offences,\n\n(2)\nconcerned during the postponement period, the Court shall not\n\n(a)\n\nimpose a fine on him;\n\n\f41\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nmake  any  order  involving  any  payment  by  him,  other  than  a\ncompensation order; or\n\nmake  any  other  order  for  confiscation,  compensation  or  forfeiture\nunder this Act or any other enactment.\n\nSubject  to  subsection  (4),  where  the  Court  has  sentenced  the  defendant\n(3)\nunder subsection (1) during the postponement period, the Court may, after the\nend of that period, vary the sentence by\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nimposing a fine on him;\n\nmaking  any  order  involving  any  payment  by  him,  including  a\ncompensation order; or\n\nmaking any other order for confiscation, compensation or forfeiture\nunder this Act or any other enactment.\n\nThe Court may proceed under subsection (3) only within the period of 28\n\n(4)\ndays commencing on the last day of the postponement period.\n\nWhere the Court proceeds to sentence the defendant under subsection (1),\n(5)\nsection 15 has effect as if the defendant’s particular criminal conduct included\nconduct which constitutes offences which the Court has taken into consideration\nin deciding his sentence for the offence or offences concerned.\n\nStatement of information\n\n26.(1)\nthe period ordered by the Court where\n\nThe prosecutor shall give the Court a statement of information within\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe prosecutor applies for a confiscation order; or\n\nthe Court on its own motion determines that it is appropriate to proceed\nunder section 15 and orders the prosecutor to give the statement.\n\n\f42\n\n(2)\nWhere  the  prosecutor  believes  that  section  16  applies  with  respect  to  a\ndefendant, the statement of information is a statement of matters the prosecutor\nbelieves are relevant in connection with deciding\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nwhether section 16 applies to the defendant;\n\nwhether the defendant has benefited from his general criminal conduct;\nand\n\n(c)\n\nhis benefit from the conduct.\n\nA statement under subsection (2) shall include information the prosecutor\n\n(3)\nbelieves is relevant\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nin connection with the making by the Court of an assumption under\nsection 19; and\n\nfor  the  purpose  of  enabling  the  Court  to  determine  whether  the\ncircumstances are such that it shall not make such an assumption.\n\nWhere  the  prosecutor  does  not  believe  that  section  16  applies  to  a\n(4)\ndefendant, the statement of information is a statement of matters the prosecutor\nbelieves are relevant in connection with deciding\n\n(a)\n\nwhether  the  defendant  has  benefited  from  his  particular  criminal\nconduct; and\n\n(b)\n\nhis benefit from the conduct.\n\nWhere  the  prosecutor  gives  the  Court  a  statement  of  information,  the\n\n(5)\nprosecutor\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nmay at any time give the Court a further statement of information; and\n\nshall give the Court a further statement of information where it orders\nhim to do so, within the period ordered by the Court.\n\n(6)\n\nThe Court may, at any time, vary an order made under this section.\n\n\f43\n\nDefendant’s response to statement of information\n\n27.(1)\na copy is served on the defendant, the Court may order the defendant\n\nWhere the prosecutor gives the Court a statement of information and\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nto indicate, within the period it orders, the extent to which he accepts\neach allegation in the statement; and\n\nso far as he does not accept such an allegation, to give particulars of\nany matters he proposes to rely on.\n\nWhere the defendant accepts to any extent an allegation in a statement of\n(2)\ninformation, the Court may treat his acceptance as conclusive of the matters to\nwhich  it  relates  for  the  purpose  of  deciding  the  issues  referred  to  in  section\n26(2) or (4), as the case may be.\n\nWhere the defendant fails in any respect to comply with an order under\n(3)\nsubsection (1), he may be treated for the purposes of subsection (2) as accepting\nevery allegation in the statement of information apart from an allegation\n\n(a)\n\nin respect of which he has complied with the requirement of the order;\nand\n\n(b)\n\nthat he has benefited from his general or particular criminal conduct.\n\nFor  the  purposes  of  this  section,  an  allegation  may  be  accepted  or\n\n(4)\nparticulars may be given in a manner ordered by the Court.\n\n(5)\n\nThe Court may, at any time, vary an order made under this section.\n\nNo acceptance under this section that the defendant has benefited from\n\n(6)\nconduct is admissible in evidence in proceedings for an offence.\n\nProvision of information by defendant\n\n28.(1)\nThe Court may, at any time, for the purpose of obtaining information\nto help the Court in carrying out its functions under this Act, order a defendant\nto provide it with such information as may be specified in the order.\n\n\f44\n\nAn  order  under  this  section  may  require  all  or  a  specified  part  of  the\n\n(2)\ninformation to be given in a specified manner and before a specified date.\n\n(3)\nWhere the defendant fails without reasonable excuse to comply with an\norder  under  this  section  the  Court  may  draw  such  inference  as  it  believes  is\nappropriate.\n\nSubsection  (3)  does  not  affect  any  power  of  the  Court  to  deal  with  the\n\n(4)\ndefendant in respect of a failure to comply with an order under this section.\n\nWhere  the  prosecutor  accepts  to  any  extent  an  allegation  made  by  the\n\n(5)\ndefendant\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nin giving information required by an order under this section; or\n\nin  any  other  statement  given  to  the  Court  in  relation  to  any  matter\nrelevant to determining the amount available to him for the purposes\nof section 17,\n\nthe Court may treat the acceptance as conclusive of the matters to which it relates.\n\nFor the purposes of this section an allegation may be accepted in a manner\n\n(6)\nordered by the Court.\n\n(7)\n\nThe Court may, at any time, vary an order made under this section.\n\nNo information given under this section which amounts to an admission\n(8)\nby  a  defendant  that  he  has  benefited  from  criminal  conduct  is  admissible  in\nevidence in proceedings for an offence.\n\nReconsideration of case where no confiscation order made\n\n29.(1)\n\nThis section applies where\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nsection 13(1) applies in respect of a defendant, but the Court has not\nproceeded under section 15;\n\nthere  is  evidence  which  was  not  available  to  the  prosecutor  on  the\nrelevant date;\n\n\f45\n\n(c)\n\nbefore  the  end  of  the  period  of  6  years  starting  with  the  date  of\nconviction, the prosecutor applies to the Court to consider the evidence;\nand\n\n(d)\n\nafter considering the evidence the Court believes it is appropriate for\nit to proceed under section 15.\n\nWhere subsection (1) applies, the Court shall proceed under section 15 and\n\n(2)\nsubsections (3) to (8) apply for the purpose.\n\nWhere the Court has already sentenced the defendant for the offence (or\n(3)\nany of the offences) concerned, section 15 has effect as if his particular criminal\nconduct included conduct which constitutes offences which the Court has taken\ninto consideration in deciding his sentence for the offence or offences concerned.\n\nThe Court shall, instead of taking account of the matters specified in section\n\n(4)\n18(1)(a) and (b), take account of\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nconduct occurring before the relevant date;\n\nproperty obtained before the relevant date; and\n\nproperty obtained on or after the relevant date where it was obtained\nas  a  result  of,  or  in  connection  with,  conduct  occurring  before  the\nrelevant date.\n\n(5)\n\nFor the purposes of this section\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nthe assumptions specified in section 19(2)(a)and (b) do not apply with\nregard to property first held by the defendant on or after the relevant\ndate;\n\nthe assumption specified in section 19(2)(c) does not apply with regard\nto expenditure incurred by the defendant on or after the relevant date;\nand\n\nthe assumption specified in section 19(2)(d) does not apply with regard\nto  property  obtained,  or  assumed  to  have  been  obtained,  by  the\ndefendant on or after the relevant date.\n\n\f46\n\n(6)\nThe recoverable amount for the purposes of section 15 is such amount, not\nexceeding the amount determined in accordance with section 17, as the Court\nconsiders just.\n\n(7)\n\nIn arriving at the just amount the Court shall have regard in particular to\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nthe recoverable amount determined in accordance with section 17;\n\nany fine imposed on the defendant in respect of the offence or any of\nthe offences concerned;\n\nany order within section 22(1)(b) or (c) that has been made against the\ndefendant in respect of the offence, or any of the offences, concerned\nand has not already been taken into account by the Court in determining\nwhat is the realisable property held by him for the purposes of section\n17; and\n\n(d)\n\nany compensation order that has been made against the defendant in\nrespect of the offence, or any of the offences, concerned.\n\nWhere  a  compensation  order  has  been  made  against  the  defendant  in\n(8)\nrespect of the offence or offences concerned section 22(3) and (4) do not apply.\n\n(9)\n\nFor the purposes of this section, “the relevant date” is, where the Court\n\n(a)\n\nmade  a  decision  not  to  proceed  under  section  15,  the  date  of  the\ndecision; or\n\n(b)\n\ndid not make such a decision, the date of conviction.\n\nReconsideration of benefit where no confiscation order made\n\n30.(1)\n\nThis section applies where\n\n(a)\n\nin proceeding under section 15, the Court has determined that\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\nsection 16 applies to the defendant but he has not benefited from\nhis general criminal conduct; or\n\nsection 16 does not apply to the defendant and he has not benefited\nfrom his particular criminal conduct;\n\n\f47\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nthere is evidence which was not available to the prosecutor when the\nCourt determined that the defendant had not benefited from his general\nor particular criminal conduct;\n\nbefore  the  end  of  the  period  of  6  years  starting  with  the  date  of\nconviction the prosecutor applies to the Court to consider the evidence;\nand\n\nafter considering the evidence, the Court concludes that it would have\ndetermined  that  the  defendant  had  benefited  from  his  general  or\nparticular criminal conduct, as the case may be, if the evidence had\nbeen available to it.\n\n(2)\n\nWhere this section applies, the Court\n\n(a)\n\nshall make a fresh determination under section 15(1)(a) or (b) as to\nwhether  the  defendant  has  benefited  from  his  general  or  particular\ncriminal conduct, as the case may be; and\n\n(b)\n\nmay make a confiscation order under section 15.\n\nSubsections (4) to (8) apply where the Court proceeds under section 15\n\n(3)\npursuant to this section.\n\nWhere the Court has already sentenced the defendant for the offence, or\n(4)\nany of the offences concerned, section 15 has effect as if the defendant’s particular\ncriminal conduct included conduct which constitutes offences which the Court\nhas taken into consideration in deciding his sentence for the offence or offences\nconcerned.\n\nThe Court shall, instead of taking account of the matters specified in section\n\n(5)\n18(1)(a) and (b), take account of\n\n(a)\n\nconduct  occurring  before  the  date  of  the  original  decision  that  the\ndefendant  had  not  benefited  from  his  general  or  particular  criminal\nconduct;\n\n(b)\n\nproperty obtained before that date; and\n\n\f48\n\n(c)\n\nproperty obtained on or after that date where it was obtained as a result\nof, or in connection with, conduct occurring before that date.\n\n(6)\n\nFor the purposes of this section\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nthe assumptions specified in section 19(2)(a) and (b) do not apply with\nregard to property first held by the defendant on or after the date of the\noriginal decision that the defendant had not benefited from his general\nor particular criminal conduct;\n\nthe assumption specified in  section 19(2)(c) does not apply with regard\nto expenditure incurred by him on or after that date; and\n\nthe assumption specified in  section 19(2)(d) does not apply with regard\nto property obtained, or assumed to have been obtained, by him on or\nafter that date.\n\nThe recoverable amount for the purposes of section 17 is such amount as\n(7)\nthe Court considers just, but that amount shall not exceed the amount that the\nrecoverable amount would have been under section 17 if this subsection did not\napply.\n\n(8)\n\nIn arriving at the just amount the Court shall have regard in particular to\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nthe recoverable amount determined in accordance with section 17;\n\nany fine imposed on the defendant in respect of the offence, or any of\nthe offences, concerned;\n\nany order within section 22(1)(b) or (c) that has been made against him\nin respect of the offence, or any of the offences, concerned and has not\nalready been taken into account by the Court in determining what is\nthe realisable property held by him for the purposes of section 17; and\n\n(d)\n\nany compensation order that has been made against him.\n\n\f49\n\nReconsideration of benefit where confiscation order made\n\n31.(1)\n\nThis section applies where\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nthe Court has made a confiscation order;\n\nthere  is  evidence  which  was  not  available  to  the  prosecutor  at  the\nrelevant time;\n\nthe prosecutor believes that if the Court were to determine the amount\nof the defendant’s benefit pursuant to this section it would exceed the\nrelevant amount;\n\nbefore  the  end  of  the  period  of  6  years  starting  with  the  date  of\nconviction the prosecutor applies to the Court to consider the evidence;\nand\n\n(e)\n\nafter considering the evidence the Court believes it is appropriate for\nit to proceed under this section.\n\nWhere this section applies, the Court shall make a new calculation of the\n(2)\ndefendant’s benefit from the conduct concerned, and subsections (3) to (11) apply\nfor this purpose.\n\nWhere the Court has already sentenced the defendant for the offence, or\n(3)\nany of the offences concerned, section 15 has effect as if his particular criminal\nconduct included conduct which constitutes offences which the Court has taken\ninto consideration in deciding his sentence for the offence or offences concerned.\n\nThe Court shall, instead of taking account of the matters specified in section\n\n(4)\n18(1)(a) and (b), take account of\n\n(a)\n\nconduct occurring up to the time it determined the defendant’s benefit\nfor the purposes of the confiscation order;\n\n(b)\n\nproperty obtained up to that time; and\n\n(c)\n\nproperty obtained after that time where it was obtained as a result of,\nor in connection with, conduct occurring before that time.\n\n\f50\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\nIn applying section 18(3)(b), the confiscation order shall be ignored.\n\nFor the purposes of this section\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nthe assumptions specified in section 19(2)(a) and (b) do not apply with\nregard to property first held by the defendant after the time the Court\ndetermined his benefit for the purposes of the confiscation order;\n\nthe assumption specified in section 19(2)(c) does not apply with regard\nto expenditure incurred by him after that time; and\n\nthe assumption specified in section 19(2)(d) does not apply with regard\nto property obtained, or assumed to have been obtained, by him after\nthat time.\n\nWhere the amount determined under the new calculation of the defendant’s\n\n(7)\nbenefit exceeds the relevant amount, the Court\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nshall  make  a  new  calculation  of  the  recoverable  amount  for  the\npurposes of section 15; and\n\nwhere it exceeds the amount required to be paid under the confiscation\norder, may vary the order by substituting for the amount required to be\npaid, such amount as it believes is just.\n\n(8)\n\nIn applying subsection (7)(a) the Court shall\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\ntake the new calculation of the defendant’s benefit; and\n\napply section 17 as if references to the time the confiscation order is\nmade were to the time of the new calculation of the recoverable amount\nand as if references to the date of the confiscation order were to the\ndate of that new calculation.\n\n(9)\n\nIn applying subsection (7)(b) the Court\n\n(a)\n\nshall have regard in particular to\n\n(i)\n\nany fine imposed on the defendant for the offence, or any of the\noffences, concerned;\n\n\f51\n\n(ii)\n\nany  order  within  section  22(1)(b)  or  (c)  that  has  been  made\nagainst  the  defendant  in  respect  of  the  offence,  or  any  of  the\noffences, concerned and has not already been taken into account\nby the Court in determining what is the realisable property held\nby him for the purposes of section 17; and\n\n(iii)\n\nany compensation order that has been made against the defendant\nin respect of the offence, or any of the offences, concerned; but\n\n(b)\n\nshall not have regard to an order falling within paragraph (a)(iii) where\nan order has been made under section 22(4).\n\nIn determining under this section whether one amount exceeds another, the\n\n(10)\nCourt shall take account of any change in the value of money.\n\n(11)\n\nFor the purposes of this section,\n\n“the relevant time” is\n\n(a)\n\nwhen the Court calculated the defendant’s benefit for the purposes of\nthe confiscation order, where this section has not applied previously;\nor\n\n(b)\n\nwhen the Court last calculated the defendant’s benefit pursuant to this\nsection, where this section has applied previously;\n\n“the relevant amount” is\n\n(a)\n\nthe amount determined as the defendant’s benefit for the purposes of\nthe confiscation order, where this section has not applied previously;\nor\n\n(b)\n\nthe amount last determined as the defendant’s benefit pursuant to this\nsection, where this section has applied previously.\n\n\f52\n\nReconsideration of amount available to defendant where confiscation\norder made\n\n32.(1)\n\nThis section applies where\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nthe Court has made a confiscation order;\n\nthe  amount  required  to  be  paid  was  the  amount  determined  in\naccordance with section 17(3); and\n\nthe prosecutor or an enforcement receiver appointed in relation to the\norder applies to the Court to make a new calculation of the amount\navailable to the defendant.\n\nWhere this section applies, the Court shall make the new calculation and,\n(2)\nin doing so, it shall apply section 17 as if references to the time the confiscation\norder is made were to the time of the new calculation and as if references to the\ndate of the confiscation order were to the date of the new calculation.\n\nWhere  the  amount  determined  under  the  new  calculation  exceeds  the\n(3)\nrelevant amount, the Court may vary the order by substituting for the amount\nrequired to be paid such amount as the Court considers just, but that amount shall\nnot exceed the amount determined as the defendant’s benefit from the conduct\nconcerned.\n\n(4)\n\nIn deciding what is just the Court\n\n(a)\n\nshall have regard, in particular to\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\nany fine imposed on the defendant for the offence, or any of the\noffences, concerned;\n\nany  order  within  section  22(1)(b)  or  (c)  that  has  been  made\nagainst  the  defendant  in  respect  of  the  offence,  or  any  of  the\noffences, concerned and has not already been taken into account\nby the Court in determining what is the realisable property held\nby him for the purposes of section 17; and\n\n\f53\n\n(iii)\n\nany compensation order that has been made against him in respect\nof the offence, or any of the offences, concerned; but\n\n(b)\n\nshall not have regard to an order falling within paragraph (a)(iii) where\nan order has been made under section 22(4).\n\nIn determining under this section whether one amount exceeds another, the\n\n(5)\nCourt shall take account of any change in the value of money.\n\n(6)\n\nIn this section (3), “the relevant amount” is\n\n(a)\n\nthe amount determined as the amount available to the defendant for the\npurposes of the confiscation order, where this section has not applied\npreviously; or\n\n(b)\n\nthe amount last determined as the amount available to the defendant\npursuant to this section, where this section has applied previously.\n\nIn this section, the amount determined as the defendant’s benefit from the\n\n(7)\nconduct concerned is\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe amount determined when the confiscation order was made; or\n\nwhere one or more new calculations of the defendant’s benefit have\nbeen made under section 31 the amount determined on the occasion of\nthe last such calculation.\n\nVariation of order where amount available to defendant is inadequate\n\n33.(1)\n\nThis section applies where\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe Court has made a confiscation order; and\n\nthe defendant, the prosecutor or an enforcement receiver appointed in\nrelation to the order applies to the Court to vary the order under this\nsection.\n\nWhere this section applies, the Court shall calculate the amount available\n(2)\nto the defendant and, in doing so, it shall apply section 17 as if references to the\n\n\f54\n\ntime the confiscation order is made were to the time of the calculation and as if\nreferences to the date of the confiscation order were to the date of the calculation.\n\nWhere the Court determines that the amount available to the defendant\n(3)\ncalculated in accordance with subsection (2) is inadequate for the payment of any\namount remaining to be paid under the confiscation order, the Court may vary\nthe order by substituting for the amount required to be paid, such smaller amount\nas it considers just.\n\nWhere  a  person  has  been  adjudged  bankrupt  or  his  estate  has  been\n(4)\nsequestrated, or where an order for the liquidation of a company has been made,\nthe Court shall take into account the extent to which realisable property held by\nthe person or company may be distributed among creditors.\n\nThe Court may disregard any inadequacy which it believes is attributable,\n(5)\nwholly or partly, to anything done by the defendant for the purpose of preserving\nproperty held by the recipient of a tainted gift from any risk of realisation under\nthis Act.\n\nDischarge of order for inadequacy of amount available to defendant\n\n34.(1)\n\nThis section applies where\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nthe Court has made a confiscation order;\n\nthe Registrar applies to the Court for the discharge of the order; and\n\nthe amount remaining to be paid under the order is less than such sum\nas may be prescribed by the Minister by Order.\n\nWhere this section applies, the Court shall calculate the amount available\n(2)\nto the defendant and, in doing so, it shall apply section 17 as if references to the\ntime the confiscation order is made were to the time of the calculation and as if\nreferences to the date of the confiscation order were to the date of the calculation.\n\n\f(3)\n\nWhere the Court\n\n55\n\n(a)\n\ndetermines  that  the  amount  available  to  the  defendant  calculated  in\naccordance  with  subsection  (2)  is  inadequate  to  meet  the  amount\nremaining to be paid; and\n\n(b)\n\nis satisfied that the inadequacy is due wholly to one or more of the\nreasons specified in subsection (4),\n\nit may discharge the confiscation order.\n\n(4)\n\nThe reasons referred to in subsection (3) are\n\n(a)\n\nin a case where any of the realisable property consists of money in a\ncurrency other than dollars, that fluctuations in currency exchange rates\nhave occurred; and\n\n(b)\n\nsuch other reasons as may be prescribed by the Minister by Order.\n\nThe discharge of a confiscation order under this section does not prevent\n(5)\nthe making of an application in respect of the order under section 31(1)(d) or 32(1)\n(c).\n\nWhere on such an application the Court determines that the order should\n(6)\nbe varied under section 31(7) or 32(3), as the case may be, the court may provide\nthat its discharge under this section is revoked.\n\nDischarge of order where small amount outstanding\n\n35.(1)\nThe  Court  may,  on  its  own  motion  or  upon  the  application  of  the\nperson against whom a confiscation order is made, discharge a confiscation order\nwhere the amount remaining to be paid under the order is less than such sum as\nmay be prescribed by the Minister by Order.\n\nThe discharge of a confiscation order under this section does not prevent\n(2)\nthe making of an application in respect of the order under section 31(1)(d) or 32(1)\n(c).\n\n\f56\n\n(3)\nWhere on such an application the Court determines that the order should\nbe varied under section 31(7) or 32(3), as the case may be, the court may provide\nthat its discharge under this section is revoked.\n\nAdditional cases where statement of information to be submitted\n\n36.\n30 or the prosecutor applies under section 31\n\nWhere the Court proceeds under section 15 pursuant to section 29 or\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe prosecutor shall give the Court a statement of information within\nsuch period as the Court orders;\n\nsection 26 applies, with such modifications as may be necessary, where\nthe prosecutor applies under section 31; and\n\n(c)\n\nsections 27 and 28 apply.\n\nMaking of confiscation order where defendant absconds after\nconviction or committal\n\n37.(1)\n\nThis section applies where\n\n(a)\n\na defendant absconds\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\nbefore  or  after  he  is  convicted  of  an  offence  or  offences  in\nproceedings before the Court; or\n\nafter he is committed to the Court by a magistrate in respect of an\noffence or offences under section 68;\n\n(b)\n\nthe prosecutor applies to the Court to proceed under this section; and\n\n(c)\n\nthe Court believes it is appropriate for it to do so.\n\nWhere this section applies, subject to subsections (3) and (4), the Court\n\n(2)\nmay proceed under section 15.\n\n\f57\n\nWhere the Court proceeds under section 15 pursuant to subsection (1), this\n\n(3)\nPart has effect with the following modifications:\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nany person the Court believes is likely to be affected by an order under\nsection  15  is  entitled  to  appear  before  the  Court  and  make\nrepresentations;\n\nthe Court shall not make an order under section 15 unless the prosecutor\nhas taken reasonable steps to contact the defendant;\n\nsections 19, 26(3), 27 and 28 shall be ignored; and\n\nsections 29, 30 and 31 shall be ignored while the defendant is still an\nabsconder.\n\nWhere a defendant ceases to be an absconder, section 29 applies instead\n\n(4)\nof subsection (3).\n\nMaking of confiscation order where defendant absconds and is neither\nconvicted nor acquitted\n\n38.(1)\n\nThis section applies where\n\n(a)\n\nproceedings  for  an  offence  or  offences  are  instituted  against  a\ndefendant but are not concluded;\n\n(b)\n\nthe defendant absconds;\n\n(c)\n\na  period  of  2  years,  starting  with  the  date  the  Court  believes  the\ndefendant absconded, has ended;\n\n(d)\n\nthe prosecutor applies to the Court to proceed under this section; and\n\n(e)\n\nthe Court believes it is appropriate for it to do so.\n\nWhere  subsection  (1)  applies,  subject  to  subsection  (3),  the  Court  shall\n\n(2)\nproceed under section 15.\n\n\f58\n\nWhere the Court proceeds under section 15 pursuant to this section, this\n\n(3)\nPart has effect with the following modifications:\n\n(a)\n\nany person the Court believes is likely to be affected by an order under\nsection  15  is  entitled  to  appear  before  the  Court  and  make\nrepresentations;\n\n(b)\n\nthe Court shall not make an order under section 15 unless the prosecutor\nhas taken reasonable steps to contact the defendant;\n\n(c)\n\nsections 19, 26(3) and 27 to 30 shall be ignored; and\n\n(d)\n\nsection 31 shall be ignored while the defendant is still an absconder.\n\nWhere the defendant ceases to be an absconder, section 31 has effect as if\n\n(4)\nreferences to the date of conviction were to\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe day when proceedings for the offence concerned were instituted\nagainst the defendant; or\n\nwhere  there  are  2  or  more  offences  and  proceedings  for  them  were\ninstituted on different days, the earliest of those days.\n\n(5)\n\nWhere\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe Court makes an order under section 15 as applied by this section;\nand\n\nthe defendant is later convicted in proceedings before the Court of the\noffence, or any of the offences, concerned,\n\nsection 15 does not apply so far as that conviction is concerned.\n\nVariation of confiscation order made pursuant to section 38\n\n39.(1)\n\nThis section applies where\n\n(a)\n\nthe Court makes a confiscation order under section 15 as applied by\nsection 38;\n\n(b)\n\nthe defendant ceases to be an absconder;\n\n\f59\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nthe  defendant  is  convicted  of  an  offence,  or  any  of  the  offences,\nmentioned in section 38(1)(a);\n\nthe  defendant  believes  that  the  amount  required  to  be  paid  was  too\nlarge,  taking  into  account  the  circumstances  prevailing  when  the\namount was determined for the purposes of the order; and\n\n(e)\n\nbefore the end of the relevant period the defendant applies to the Court\nto consider the evidence on which his belief is based.\n\nWhere,  after  considering  the  evidence,  the  Court  concludes  that

have an interest in the property;\n\nthe person, and any other person who claims an interest in the property,\nmay appear and adduce evidence at the hearing of the application; and\n\nthe  Court  may,  at  any  time  before  the  final  determination  of  the\napplication, direct the prosecutor to\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\ngive notice of the application to any person who, in the opinion of\nthe Court, appears to have an interest in the property; and\n\npublish,  at  least  twice,  in  the  Official  Gazette  and  in  a  daily\nnewspaper widely circulated in Barbados, notice of the application\nin the manner and containing the particulars, and within the time,\nthat the Court considers appropriate.\n\nThe prosecutor may, before the final determination of an application for a\n(2)\nforfeiture order, apply to the Court to amend the application to include any other\nproperty, and the Court may so amend the application where it is satisfied that\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe  property  was  not  reasonably  capable  of  identification  when  the\napplication was originally made; or\n\nnecessary  evidence  became  available  only  after  the  application  was\noriginally made.\n\nWhere  the  prosecutor  intends  to  apply  to  amend  an  application  for  a\n(3)\nforfeiture order and the amendment would have the effect of including additional\n\n\f64\n\nproperty in the application for the forfeiture order, the prosecutor shall give no\nless than 14 days’ written notice of the application to amend to any person who\nhe has reason to believe may have an interest in the property to be included in\nthe application for the forfeiture order.\n\nAny person who claims an interest in the property to be included in the\n(4)\napplication for the forfeiture order may appear and adduce evidence at the hearing\nof the application to amend it.\n\nWhere an application under this section is finally determined, no further\n(5)\napplication for a forfeiture order may be made in respect of the offence for which\nthe person was convicted unless the Court gives leave for the making of a new\napplication on being satisfied that\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe property to which the new application relates was identified after\nthe previous application was determined;\n\nnecessary evidence became available after the previous application was\ndetermined; or\n\n(c)\n\nit is in the interests of justice that the new application be made.\n\nThe prosecutor shall not make an application under this section after the\n\n(6)\nend of the relevant application period in relation to the conviction.\n\nIn subsection (6) “relevant application period”, in relation to a person’s\n(7)\nconviction of an offence, means the period of 12 months, where the person is to\nbe taken to have been convicted of the offence by reason of\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nsubsection (8)(a), after the day on which the person was convicted of\nthe offence;\n\nsubsection (8)(b), after the day on which the person was discharged\nwithout conviction;\n\nsubsection (8)(c), after the day on which the court took the offence into\naccount in passing sentence for the other offence referred to therein.\n\n\f65\n\nFor the purposes of subsection (7), a person is to be taken to be convicted\n\n(8)\nof an offence where\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nhe is convicted, whether summarily or on indictment, of the offence;\n\nhe is charged with the offence and is found guilty but is discharged\nwithout conviction; or\n\na court with his consent takes the offence, of which he has not been\nfound guilty, into account in sentencing him for another offence.\n\nMaking of forfeiture order\n\nWhere the prosecutor applies to the Court for a forfeiture order against\n44.(1)\nproperty in respect of a person’s conviction of an offence and the Court is satisfied\nthat the property is property of the nature specified in section 13(2)(b) or (c) in\nrespect  of  the  offence,  the  Court  may  order  that  the  property  or  such  of  the\nproperty as is specified by the Court in the order be forfeited to the Crown.\n\nIn  determining  whether  property  is  property  of  the  nature  specified  in\n\n(2)\nsection 13(2)(b) or (c) the Court may infer that\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe property was used in, or in connection with, or was intended to be\nused in, or in connection with, the commission of the offence, where\nthe  evidence  establishes  that  the  property  was  in  the  person’s\npossession at the time of, or immediately after, the commission of the\noffence for which the person was convicted;\n\nthe  property  was  obtained  as  a  result  of,  or  in  connection  with,  the\ncommission  by  the  person  of  the  offence  for  which  the  person  was\nconvicted,  where  the  evidence  establishes  that  property,  and  in\nparticular money, was found in the person’s possession or under his\ncontrol  in  a  building,  vehicle,  receptacle  or  other  place  during  the\ncourse  of  investigations  conducted  by  the  police  before  or  after  the\narrest and charge of the person for the offence for which the person\nwas convicted;\n\n\f66\n\n(c)\n\nthe value of the increase represents property which was obtained as a\nresult of, or in connection with, the commission by the person of the\noffence  for  which  the  person  was  convicted,  where  the  evidence\nestablishes that the value, after the commission of the offence, of all\nascertainable property of the person convicted of the offence exceeds\nthe  value  of  all  ascertainable  property  of  the  person  prior  to  the\ncommission of the offence, and the Court is satisfied that the income\nof  the  person  from  sources  unrelated  to  the  criminal  conduct  of  the\nperson cannot reasonably account for the increase in value.\n\nWhere the Court orders that property, other than money, be forfeited to the\n(3)\nCrown, the Court shall specify in the order the amount that it considers to be the\nvalue of the property at the time when the order is made.\n\nIn  considering  whether  a  forfeiture  order  should  be  made  under\n\n(4)\nsubsection (1), the Court shall have regard to\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nthe rights and interests, if any, of third parties in the property;\n\nthe gravity of the offence concerned;\n\nany  hardship  that  may  reasonably  be  expected  to  be  caused  to  any\nperson, by the operation of the order; and\n\nthe use that is ordinarily made of the property, or the use to which the\nproperty was intended to be put.\n\nWhere  the  Court  makes  a  forfeiture  order  the  Court  may  give  such\n\n(5)\ndirections as are necessary or convenient for giving effect to the order.\n\nEffect of forfeiture order\n\n45.(1)\nSubject to subsection (2), where the Court makes a forfeiture order\nagainst any property, the property vests absolutely in the Crown by virtue of the\norder.\n\n\f67\n\nWhere property directed by a forfeiture order to be forfeited is registrable\n\n(2)\nproperty\n\n(a)\n\nthe property vests in the Crown in equity but does not vest in the Crown\nat  law  until  the  applicable  registration  requirements  have  been\ncomplied with;\n\n(b)\n\nthe Crown is entitled to be registered as owner of the property; and\n\n(c)\n\nthe  Attorney-General  has  power  on  behalf  of  the  Crown  to  do,  or\nauthorise the doing of, anything necessary or convenient to obtain the\nregistration  of  the  Crown  as  owner,  including  the  execution  of  any\ninstrument required to be executed by a person transferring an interest\nin property of that kind.\n\n(3)\n\nWhere the Court makes a forfeiture order against property\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe  property  shall  not,  except  with  the  leave  of  the  Court  and  in\naccordance  with  any  directions  of  the  Court,  be  disposed  of,  or\notherwise dealt with, by or on behalf of the Crown, before the relevant\nappeal date; and\n\nif, after the relevant appeal date, the order has not been discharged, the\nproperty  may  be  disposed  of  and  the  proceeds  applied  or  otherwise\ndealt with in accordance with the directions of the Recovery Authority;\nand the directions shall be followed.\n\n(4)\nWithout limiting the generality of subsection (3)(b) the directions that may\nbe given pursuant to that subsection include a direction that the property is to be\ndisposed of in accordance with the provisions of any enactment specified in the\ndirection.\n\n(5)\n\nIn this section\n\n“registrable property” means property the

acquired\nit, property of the nature specified in section 13(2)(b) or (c),\n\nthe Court shall make an order declaring the nature, extent and value (as at the\ntime the order is made) of his interest.\n\nSubject to subsection (4), where a forfeiture order has already been made\n(3)\ndirecting the forfeiture of property, a person who claims an interest in the property\nmay, before the end

and\n\n\f77\n\n(c)\n\nthe prosecutor shall, unless the Court is of the opinion that giving notice\nbefore  the  making  of  the  order  would  result  in  the  disappearance,\ndissipation  or  reduction  in  value  of  the  property,  give  such  written\nnotice of the application as the Court may require to the defendant and\nto any other person who may be affected by the order.\n\nNotwithstanding  subsection  (1)(b)(ii),  where  the  defendant  is  a  person\n\n(2)\nagainst whom a terrorist designation order is in force\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nit shall not be necessary to support the application with the information\nspecified in subsection (1)(b)(ii); but\n\nthe  application  shall  be  accompanied  by  a  copy  of  the  terrorist\ndesignation order.\n\nNotwithstanding subsection (1), where the defendant is a person in relation\n(3)\nto  whom  an  external  request  is  made  and  accepted,  it  is  sufficient  for  the\napplication to be supported by a certificate by the official authorised to receive\nand accept such requests certifying that the request was duly made and accepted\nin accordance with any relevant enactment, treaty or other arrangement.\n\nMaking of restraining order\n\n54.(1)\nWhere any paragraph in section 52(1) is satisfied, the Court may, on\nthe application of the prosecutor, by order, prohibit any person

the application of the prosecutor, whether at the time of the application\n(6)\nfor the restraining order or at any time afterwards, the Court may make such order\nas it considers appropriate for ensuring that the restraining order is effective.\n\nIn considering whether to make an order under subsection (6), the Court\n(7)\nshall,  in  particular,  consider  whether  any  restriction  or  prohibition  on  the\ndefendant's  travel  outside  Barbados  ought  to  be  imposed  for  the  purpose\nmentioned in that subsection.\n\nA restraining order does not affect property for the time being subject to a\n\n(8)\ncharge under any other enactment or pursuant to an order of a court.\n\nWhere the Court makes a restraining order, a law enforcement officer may,\n(9)\nfor the purpose of preventing any property to which the order applies from being\nremoved from Barbados, seize the property.\n\nProperty seized under subsection (9) shall be dealt with in accordance with\n\n(10)\nthe Court’s directions.\n\nVariation or discharge of restraining order\n\n55.(1)\nAn  application  to  vary  or  discharge  a  restraining  order  or  an  order\nmade under section 54(6) may be made to

that subsection was made, the Court shall\ndischarge  the  restraining  order  on  the  conclusion  of  the\nproceedings or the application, as the case may be;\n\nan  investigation  referred  to  in  section  52(1)  was  started  or  an\napplication referred to in that subsection was to be made, the Court\nshall discharge the restraining order where, within a reasonable\nperiod,  proceedings  for  the  offence  are  not  instituted  or  the\napplication is not made, as the case may be.\n\n(3)\nWhere a restraining order was made on the basis that an external request\nfor the making, in Barbados, of an order to prohibit dealing with relevant property\nwas accepted, the Court shall discharge the order where\n\n(a)\n\nat  the  conclusion  of  the  proceedings  for  an  offence  with  respect  to\nwhich the order was made, no external order is made; or\n\n(b)\n\nwithin a reasonable period, no external order is made.\n\nHearsay evidence\n\n56.(1)\nNotwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  in  the  Evidence  Act,\nCap.  121,  evidence  shall  not  be  excluded  on  the  ground  that  it  is  hearsay,  of\nwhatever degree, in proceedings\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nfor a restraining order;\n\nto vary or discharge a restraining order; or\n\non  an  appeal  against  a  restraining  order  or  an  order  varying  or\ndischarging a restraining order.\n\n\f80\n\nThis  section  does

exercising  those  functions  for  the  purpose  of\ndistributing  any  property  held  by  the  company  to  the  company’s\ncreditors; or\n\nprevent  the  payment  out  of  any  property  of  expenses,  including  the\nremuneration of the liquidator, properly incurred in the winding up in\nrespect of the property.\n\nSubsection (2) does not affect the enforcement of a charge made

property\nbeing  made  available,  by  the  realisation  of  the  property,  for\nsatisfying any confiscation order that has been, or may be, made\nagainst the defendant;\n\nin a case where a confiscation order or a forfeiture order has not\nbeen made, with a view to securing that there is no diminution in\nthe value of realisable property;\n\n(iii)\n\nwithout taking account of any obligation of the defendant or a\nrecipient of a tainted gift, where the obligation conflicts with the\n\n\f90\n\nobjective of satisfying any confiscation order that has been made,\nor may be made, against the defendant; and\n\n(b)\n\nmay be exercised in respect of a debt owed by the Crown.\n\n(3)\n\nSubsection (2) has effect subject to the following:\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nthe powers must be

defendant has been convicted of it by a magistrate; and\n\nthe magistrate has power to deal with him in respect of it.\n\nWhere a defendant is committed to the Court under this section in respect\n\n(4)\nof an offence or offences, the Court\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nshall inquire into the circumstances of the case;\n\nmay deal with the defendant in any way in which the magistrate could\ndeal with him if he had just convicted him of the offence; and\n\n(c)\n\nsection 13 applies accordingly.\n\n(5)\n\nA committal under this section may be in custody or on bail.\n\n\f93\n\nPART III\n\nCIVIL RECOVERY OF PROCEEDS AND INSTRUMENTALITIES OF\nCRIME\n\nDivision 1\n\nPreliminary to Part III\n\nScope of Part III\n\n69.(1)\n\nThis Part has effect for the purposes of enabling\n\n(a)\n\nthe  Recovery  Authority  to  recover  in  civil  proceedings  before  the\nCourt, property which is, or represents\n\n(i)\n\nproperty obtained through unlawful conduct;\n\n(ii)\n\nproperty used in, or in connection with, or intended to be used in,\nor in connection with, unlawful conduct; and\n\n(b)\n\nproperty which is, or represents, property obtained through unlawful\nconduct, or which is intended to be used in unlawful conduct, to be\nforfeited in civil proceedings.\n\nThe  powers  conferred  by  this  Part  are  exercisable  in  relation  to  any\n(2)\nproperty, including cash, whether or not proceedings have been brought for an\noffence in connection with the property.\n\nInterpretation of Part III\n\n70.(1)\n\nIn this Part\n\n“assigned matter” has the meaning assigned to it in section 2(1) of the Customs\n\nAct, Cap. 66;\n\n“excepted joint owner” has the meaning specified in section 95(3);\n\n“period of 72 hours” excludes Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays;\n\n\f“property  obtained  through  unlawful  conduct”  has  the  meaning  specified  in\n\n94\n\nsection 72;\n\n“respondent” means\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nwhere proceedings are brought by the Recovery Authority under this\nPart, the person against whom the proceedings are brought; and\n\nwhere  no  such  proceedings  have  been  brought  but  the  Recovery\nAuthority has applied for a freezing order, the person against whom\nthe Recovery Authority intends to bring such proceedings;\n\n“tainted  property”  means,  subject  to  subsection  (3),  property  used  in,  or  in\nconnection with, or intended to be used in, or in connection with, unlawful\nconduct;\n\n“value” means market value.\n\nFor the purposes of this Part, proceedings against a person for an offence\n\n(2)\nare concluded when\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nthe person is convicted or acquitted;\n\nthe prosecution is discontinued; or\n\nthe jury is discharged without a finding.\n\nProperty  belonging  to  a  person  (“the  owner”)  is  not  tainted  property\n\n(3)\nwhere\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe  unlawful  conduct  concerned  is  not  the  unlawful  conduct  of  the\nowner; and\n\nthe owner does not give his consent, express or implied, to the property\nbeing used in, or in connection with, the unlawful conduct.\n\nFor the purposes of subsection (3), the “unlawful conduct concerned” is\n(4)\nthe  unlawful  conduct  that  the  property  is  used  in,  or  in  connection  with,  or\nintended to be used in, or in connection with.\n\n(5)\n\nSections 71 to 81 and this section have effect for the purposes of this Part.\n\n\f95\n\nMeaning of “unlawful conduct”\n\n71.(1)\n\n“Unlawful conduct” is conduct which, if it occurs in\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nBarbados, is unlawful under the criminal law of Barbados; or\n\na country other than Barbados\n\n(i)\n\nis unlawful under the criminal law of that country; and\n\n(ii)\n\nif it occurred in Barbados, would be unlawful under the criminal\nlaw of Barbados.\n\nThe Court, or in respect of proceedings for the forfeiture of cash or listed\n(2)\nassets, a magistrate, shall decide on a balance of probabilities whether it is proved\nthat\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nany matters alleged to constitute unlawful conduct have occurred; or\n\nany person used, or intended to use, any property in, or in connection\nwith, unlawful conduct.\n\nMeaning of “property obtained through unlawful conduct”\n\nA person obtains property through unlawful conduct, whether his own\n72.(1)\nconduct or another person’s conduct, where he obtains property by or in return\nfor the conduct.\n\nIn deciding whether any property was obtained through unlawful conduct\n\n(2)\nit is\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nimmaterial whether or not any money, goods or services were provided\nin  order  to  put  the  person  in  question  in  a  position  to  carry  out  the\nconduct; and\n\nnot necessary to show that the conduct was of a particular kind where\nit is shown that the property was obtained through conduct of one of a\nnumber of kinds, each of which would have been unlawful conduct.\n\n\f96\n\nRecoverable property\n\n73.(1)\nand tainted property is recoverable property.\n\nSubject to subsection (2), property obtained through unlawful conduct\n\n(2)\nProperty  obtained  through  unlawful  conduct  that  has  been  disposed  of\nsince it was obtained through unlawful conduct and tainted property that has been\ndisposed of since it became tainted property, is recoverable property only where\nthe property is held by a person into whose hands it may be followed.\n\nRecoverable property may be followed into the hands of a person obtaining\n\n(3)\nit on a disposal\n\n(a)\n\nin the case of\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\nproperty obtained through unlawful conduct, by the person who,\nthrough the conduct, obtained the property;\n\ntainted property, by any person who had possession of the property\nfor  the  purpose,  or  with  the  intent,  of  using  the  property  for\nunlawful conduct; or\n\n(b)\n\nby a person into whose hands it may, by virtue of this subsection, be\nfollowed.\n\nTracing recoverable property\n\n74.(1)\nWhere  property  obtained  through  unlawful  conduct  or  tainted\nproperty (“the original property”) is or has been recoverable property, property\nwhich represents the original property is also recoverable property.\n\n(2)\n\nWhere a person enters into a transaction by which he\n\n(a)\n\ndisposes  of  recoverable  property,  whether  the  original  property  or\nproperty which, by virtue of this Part, represents the original property;\nand\n\n(b)\n\nobtains other property in place of it;\n\n\f97\n\nthe other property represents the original property.\n\nWhere  a  person  disposes  of  recoverable  property  which  represents  the\n(3)\noriginal property, the property may be followed into the hands of the person who\nobtains it, and it continues to represent the original property.\n\nMixing recoverable property\n\nWhere a person’s recoverable property is mixed with other property,\n75.(1)\nwhether  the  other  property  is  his  property  or  another  person’s  property,  the\nportion of the mixed property which is attributable to the recoverable property\nrepresents  the  property  obtained  through  unlawful  conduct  or  the  tainted\nproperty, as the case may be.\n\nWithout limiting subsection (1), recoverable property is mixed with other\n\n(2)\nproperty where it is used, among other things,\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\n(e)\n\nto increase funds held in a bank account;\n\nin part payment for the acquisition of an asset;\n\nfor the restoration or improvement of land;\n\nfor the discharge, in whole or in part, of a mortgage, charge or other\nsecurity; or\n\nby  a  person  holding  a  leasehold  interest  in  property  to  acquire  the\nfreehold.\n\nProfits accruing on recoverable property\n\n76.\nWhere  a  person  who  has  recoverable  property  obtains  additional\nproperty consisting of profits accruing in respect of the recoverable property, the\nadditional property is to be treated as representing the property obtained through\nunlawful conduct or the tainted property, as the case may be.\n\n\f98\n\nCases in which property is not, or ceases to be, recoverable\n\n77.(1)\n\nWhere\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\na person disposes of recoverable property; and\n\nthe person who obtains the property on the disposal does so in good\nfaith, for value and without notice that it was recoverable property,\n\nthe property may not be followed into that person’s hands and, accordingly, it\nceases to be recoverable.\n\n(2)\n\nRecoverable property ceases to be recoverable\n\n(a)\n\nwhere it is vested, forfeited or otherwise disposed of pursuant to powers\nconferred by virtue of this Part;\n\n(b)\n\nwhere\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\npursuant to a judgment in civil proceedings, whether in Barbados\nor elsewhere, a defendant makes a payment to a claimant or the\nclaimant otherwise obtains property from the defendant;\n\nthe  claimant’s  claim  is  based  on  the  defendant’s  unlawful\nconduct; and\n\napart  from  this  paragraph,  the  sum  received,  or  the  property\nobtained, by the claimant would be recoverable property; or\n\n(c)\n\nwhere a payment is made to a person under a compensation order and,\napart  from  this  paragraph,  the  sum  received  would  be  recoverable\nproperty.\n\n(3)\n\nProperty is not recoverable where\n\n(a)\n\na restraining order applies to it, whether made under\n\n(i)\n\nthis Act; or\n\n(ii)\n\nanother enactment;\n\n\f99\n\n(b)\n\nit has been taken into account in determining the amount of a person’s\nbenefit from criminal conduct for the purpose of making a confiscation\norder under\n\n(i)\n\nthis Act; or\n\n(ii)\n\nanother enactment.\n\nThe reference to the amount of a person’s benefit from criminal conduct\n(4)\nis to be construed, in relation to an order mentioned in subsection (3)(b)(ii), as a\nreference to the corresponding amount under the enactment in question.\n\n(5)\n\nWhere\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\na person enters into a transaction to which section 74(2) applies; and\n\nthe disposal is one to which subsection (1) or subsection (2)(a) applies,\n\nthis section does not affect the recoverability, by virtue of section 74(2), of any\nproperty obtained on the transaction in the place of the property disposed of.\n\nMinister may prescribe cases in which property is not recoverable or\nassociated property\n\n78.(1)\nThe Minister may by Order subject to negative Resolution provide\nthat property is not recoverable or, as the case may be, associated property where\nit is\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nproperty specified in the Order or property of the description specified\nin the Order; or\n\ndisposed  of  pursuant  to  an  enactment  specified  in  the  Order  or  an\nenactment of a description specified in the Order.\n\n(2)\n\nAn Order made under subsection (1) may\n\n(a)\n\nprovide that where property is disposed of pursuant to an enactment\nspecified in the Order or an enactment of a description specified in the\nOrder, it is to be treated for the purposes of section 99 as if it had been\ndisposed of pursuant to a recovery order;\n\n\f100\n\n(b)\n\napply to property, or a disposal of property, only in such circumstances\nas may be prescribed in the Order, and the circumstances may relate to\nthe property or disposal itself or to a person who holds or has held the\nproperty or to any other matter.\n\nGranting interests in recoverable property\n\nWhere  a  person  grants  an  interest  in  his  recoverable  property,  the\n79.(1)\nquestion whether the interest is also recoverable is to be determined in the same\nmanner  as  that  question  is  determined  on  any  other  disposal  of  recoverable\nproperty.\n\nIn  furtherance  of  subsection  (1),  where  a  person  grants  an  interest  in\n\n(2)\nproperty and that property\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nis property obtained through unlawful conduct or tainted property, the\ninterest  is  also  to  be  treated  as  obtained  through  that  conduct  or  as\ntainted property, as the case may be; and\n\nrepresents in his hands property obtained through unlawful conduct or\ntainted property, the interest is also to be treated as representing in his\nhands the property so obtained or the tainted property, as the case may\nbe.\n\nMeaning of “associated property”\n\n80.\n“Associated  property”  means,  in  relation  to  recoverable  property,\nproperty  of  any  of  the  following  descriptions  (including  property  held  by  a\nrespondent) which is not itself the recoverable property:\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nany interest in the recoverable property;\n\nany other interest in the property in which the recoverable property\nsubsists;\n\nwhere the recoverable property is a tenancy in common, the tenancy\nof the other tenant;\n\n\f101\n\n(d)\n\nwhere the recoverable property is part of a larger property, but not a\nseparate part, the remainder of the larger property,\n\nand a reference to property being associated with recoverable property shall be\nconstrued accordingly.\n\nObtaining and disposing of property\n\nA reference to a person disposing of his property includes a reference\n81.(1)\nto his disposing of a part of it or granting an interest in it or both, and a reference\nto the property disposed of is to any property obtained on the disposal.\n\nA person who makes a payment to another person is to be treated as making\n(2)\na disposal of his property to the other person, whatever form the payment takes.\n\nWhere  a  person’s  property  passes  to  another  person  under  a  will  or\n(3)\nintestacy or otherwise by operation of law, it is to be treated as disposed of by\nhim to the other person.\n\nA person is only to be treated as having obtained his property for value in\n(4)\na  case  where  he  gave  unexecuted  consideration  where  the  consideration  has\nbecome executed consideration.\n\nDivision 2\n\nRecovery Orders and Freezing Orders\n\nMaking of Recovery Orders and Freezing Orders\n\nApplication for recovery order\n\n82.(1)\nThe Recovery Authority may apply to the Court, by way of a claim\nform,  for  a  recovery  order  against  any  person  who  the  Recovery  Authority\nbelieves holds recoverable property.\n\n(2)\n\nThe Recovery Authority shall serve the claim form\n\n(a)\n\non the respondent; and\n\n\f102\n\n(b)\n\nunless the Court dispenses with service, on any other person who the\nRecovery  Authority  believes  holds  associated  property  which  the\nRecovery Authority wishes to be subject to the recovery order.\n\n(3)\n\nThe claim form shall\n\n(a)\n\nspecify  or  describe  generally,  the  property  in  relation  to  which  the\nRecovery Authority seeks the order;\n\n(b)\n\nstate, in relation to each item or description of property identified\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\nwhether it is alleged that the property is recoverable property or\nassociated property; and\n\nwho  is  alleged  to  hold  the  property  or,  where  the  Recovery\nAuthority is unable to identify the person who holds the property,\nthe  steps  that  have  been  taken  to  establish  the  identity  of  the\nperson.\n\nApplication for freezing order\n\nWhere  the  Recovery  Authority  may  institute  proceedings  for  a\n83.(1)\nrecovery order, the Recovery Authority may apply to the Court, whether before\nor after instituting the proceedings, for an order to prohibit any person whose\nproperty is specified or described in the order from in any way dealing with the\nproperty.\n\nAn application for a freezing order may be made without notice where the\n(2)\ncircumstances are such that notice of the application would prejudice any right\nof the Recovery Authority to obtain a recovery order in respect of any property\nto which the order relates.\n\n\f103\n\n(3)\n\nThe Court may make a freezing order\n\n(a)\n\nwhere it is satisfied\n\n(i)\n\nthat there is a good arguable case that\n\n(A)\n\n(B)\n\nthe property to which the application for the order relates is\nor includes recoverable property; and\n\nin  a  case  where  any  of  the  property  is  not  recoverable\nproperty, it is associated property; and\n\n(ii)\n\nin a case where the property to which the application for the order\nrelates includes property alleged to be associated property, and the\nRecovery Authority has not established the identity of the person\nwho holds it, that the Recovery Authority has taken all reasonable\nsteps to do so; and\n\n(b)\n\nsubject to such exclusions and conditions as are permitted by this Act\nor as the Court considers appropriate.\n\nVariation and setting aside of freezing order\n\n84.(1)\n\nThe Court may at any time vary or set aside a freezing order.\n\nWhere the Court determines that any property to which a freezing order\n(2)\napplies is neither recoverable property nor associated property, the Court shall\nvary the order so as to exclude the property.\n\nThe Court shall, unless acting under subsection (2), give the parties to the\n(3)\nproceedings, any receiver appointed in respect of property subject to the freezing\norder and any person who may be affected by its decision an opportunity to be\nheard before varying or setting aside the order.\n\nExclusions from freezing order\n\n85.(1)\n\nThe power to make or vary a freezing order includes the power to\n\n(a)\n\nexclude specified property, or property described in the order, from the\norder; and\n\n\f104\n\n(b)\n\notherwise make exclusions from the prohibition on dealing with the\nproperty to which the order applies.\n\n(2)\nAn  exclusion  may  be  made  subject  to  such  conditions  as  the  Court\nconsiders appropriate and may, in particular, make provision for the purpose of\nenabling any person to\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nmeet any legal expenses and reasonable living expenses; or\n\ncarry on any trade, business, profession or occupation.\n\nWhere the Court exercises the power to make an exclusion for the purpose\n(3)\nof enabling a person to meet legal expenses that he has incurred, or may incur,\nin respect of proceedings under this Part, it must ensure that the exclusion\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nis limited to reasonable legal expenses that the person has reasonably\nincurred or that he reasonably incurs; and\n\nspecifies  the  total  amount  that  may  be  released  for  legal  expenses\npursuant to the exclusion.\n\nSubject to subsections (2) and (3), the power to make exclusions must be\n(4)\nexercised with a view to ensuring, so far as practicable, that the satisfaction of\nany right of the Recovery Authority to recover the property obtained through\nunlawful conduct or the tainted property is not unduly prejudiced.\n\nThe Court may vary a freezing order so as to exclude from the property to\n(5)\nwhich the order applies any property which is alleged to be associated property\nwhere the Court thinks that the satisfaction of any right of the Recovery Authority\nto recover the property obtained through unlawful conduct or the tainted property\nwill not be prejudiced.\n\nThe Court may exclude any property within subsection (5) on such terms\n(6)\nor conditions applying, while the freezing order has effect, which the Court thinks\nnecessary or expedient.\n\n\f105\n\nEffect of freezing order\n\n86.(1)\n\nWhere a freezing order has effect\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe  Court  may  stay  any  action,  execution  or  other  legal  process  in\nrespect of the property to which the order applies; and\n\nno distress may be levied against the property to which the order applies\nexcept with the leave of the Court and subject to any terms the Court\nmay impose.\n\nWhere the Court is satisfied that a freezing order has been applied for or\n(2)\nmade in respect of any property in respect of which proceedings are pending, it\nmay stay the proceedings or allow them to continue on any terms it thinks fit.\n\nWhere a freezing order applies to a tenancy of any premises, no landlord\n(3)\nor other person to whom rent is payable may exercise the right of forfeiture in\nrelation to the premises in respect of any failure by the tenant to comply with any\nterm or condition of the tenancy, except with the leave of the Court and subject\nto any terms the Court may impose.\n\nThe Court shall, before exercising any power conferred by this section,\n(4)\ngive the parties to any of the proceedings concerned, where a receiver is appointed\nunder section 87, the receiver, and any person who may be affected by the Court’s\ndecision an opportunity to be heard.\n\nReceivers may be appointed in respect of freezing orders\n\n87.(1)\nWhere  the  Court  makes  a  freezing  order,  the  Court  may,  on  the\napplication of the Recovery Authority, whether at the time of the application for\nthe freezing order or at any time afterwards, appoint a receiver in respect of any\nproperty to which the freezing order applies.\n\nAn  application  for  the  appointment  of  a  receiver  may  be  made  without\n(2)\nnotice  where  the  circumstances  are  such  that  notice  of  the  application  would\nprejudice any right of the Recovery Authority to obtain a recovery order in respect\nof any property to which the order relates.\n\n\f(3)\n\nThe Court may, by order, authorise or require the receiver\n\n106\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nto exercise any of the powers specified in subsection (4) in relation to\nany property in respect of which the receiver is appointed;\n\nto take any other measures the Court thinks appropriate in connection\nwith  the  management  of  any  such  property,  including  securing  the\ndetention, custody or preservation of the property in order to manage\nit; and\n\nwhere the Recovery Authority so requests in its application, to take any\nmeasures which the Court considers necessary to establish whether or\nnot\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\nthe property to which the order applies is recoverable property or\nassociated property; or\n\nany other property is recoverable property in relation to the same\nunlawful conduct and, if it is, who holds it.\n\n(4)\n\nThe powers referred to in subsection (3)(a) are power to\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nseize the property to which the order applies;\n\nobtain information or require a person to answer any question;\n\nenter any premises to which the order applies and to\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\ncarry out a search for or inspection of anything described in the\norder;\n\nmake or obtain a copy, photograph or other record of anything so\ndescribed; and\n\nremove anything which he is required to take possession of in\npursuance of the order or which may be required as evidence in\nthe proceedings under this Part,\n\nand  the  order  by  which  the  power  is  granted  may  describe  anything\ngenerally, whether by reference to a class or otherwise;\n\n\f107\n\n(d)\n\nmanage any property to which the order applies including power\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\nto sell or otherwise dispose of assets comprised in the property\nwhich are perishable or which ought to be disposed of before their\nvalue diminishes;\n\nwhere  the  property  comprises  assets  of  a  trade  or  business,  to\ncarry on, or arrange for another to carry on, the trade or business;\nand\n\n(iii)\n\nto incur capital expenditure in respect of the property.\n\n(5)\n\nFor the purpose of subsection (4)(b)\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\na requirement imposed in the exercise of the power has effect in spite\nof any restriction on the disclosure of information, however imposed;\nand\n\na statement made by a person in pursuance of such a requirement may\nnot be used in evidence against him in criminal proceedings, other than\nproceedings for\n\n(i)\n\nan offence under the Perjury Act, Cap. 142; or\n\n(ii)\n\nanother  offence  where,  in  giving  evidence,  the  person  makes  a\nstatement inconsistent with that previous statement.\n\nA statement may not be used by virtue of subsection (5)(b)(ii) against a\n\n(6)\nperson unless\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nevidence relating to it is adduced; or\n\na question relating to it is asked,\n\nby or on behalf of the person in the proceedings.\n\n(7)\n\nAn order making any provision under\n\n(a)\n\nsubsection  (4)(b)  or  (c)  shall  include  provision  in  respect  of  legal\nprofessional privilege;\n\n\f108\n\n(b)\n\nsubsection (4)(c) may require any person to give the receiver\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\naccess to any premises which the receiver may enter in pursuance\nof subsection (4)(c); and\n\nany  assistance  the  receiver  may  require  for  taking  the  steps\nmentioned in subsection (4)(c).\n\nThe Court may, by order, require any person in respect of whose property\n\n(8)\nthe receiver is appointed to\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nbring the property to a place specified by the receiver or to place it in\nthe custody of the receiver;\n\ndo  anything  he  is  reasonably  required  to  do  by  the  receiver  for  the\npreservation of the property; and\n\nbring  any  documents  relating  to  the  property  which  are  in  his\npossession or control to a place specified by the receiver or to place\nthem in the custody of the receiver.\n\nAny prohibition on dealing with property imposed by a freezing order does\n(9)\nnot prevent a person from complying with any requirements imposed by virtue\nof this section.\n\nThe  Recovery  Authority  may,  in  its  application  for  an  order  under  this\n\n(10)\nsection, nominate a suitably qualified person for appointment as a receiver.\n\nThe  Recovery  Authority  may  apply  a  sum  received  by  it  under  section\n(11)\n100(2)  in  making  payment  of  the  remuneration  and  expenses  of  a  receiver\nappointed under this section.\n\nSupervision of receiver appointed in respect of freezing order\n\n88.(1)\nAny of the following persons may apply to the Court for directions as\nto the exercise of the functions of a receiver appointed in respect of a freezing\norder:\n\n(a)\n\nthe receiver;\n\n\f109\n\n(b)\n\nany party to the proceedings for the appointment of the receiver or the\nfreezing order concerned;\n\n(c)\n\nany person affected by action taken by the receiver; and\n\n(d)\n\nany person who may be affected by action the receiver proposes to take.\n\nThe Court shall, before giving any directions under subsection (1), give an\n\n(2)\nopportunity to be heard to\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nthe receiver;\n\nthe parties to the proceedings for the appointment of the receiver and\nfor the freezing order concerned; and\n\nany person who may be interested in the application under subsection\n(1).\n\nReceiver appointed in respect of freezing order not liable for certain\naction\n\n89.\n\nWhere\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe receiver deals with any property which is not property in respect of\nwhich he is appointed; and\n\nat the time he deals with the property he believes on reasonable grounds\nthat he is entitled to do so by virtue of his appointment, the receiver is\nnot liable to any person in respect of any loss or damage resulting from\nhis dealing with the property except so far as the loss or damage is\ncaused by his negligence.\n\nVariation or setting aside of order appointing receiver in respect of\nfreezing order\n\n90.(1)\nThe Court may at any time vary or set aside any order appointing a\nreceiver  under  section  87  or  any  other  order  made  under  that  section  or  any\ndirections given under section 88.\n\n\f110\n\nThe Court shall, before exercising any power under subsection (1), give\n\n(2)\nan opportunity to be heard to\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe receiver;\n\nthe parties to the proceedings for the appointment of the receiver under\nsection 87 or any other order under that section or, as the case may be,\nfor directions under section 88;\n\n(c)\n\nthe parties to the proceedings for the freezing order concerned; and\n\n(d)\n\nany person who may be affected by the Court’s decision.\n\nReporting by receiver\n\n91.\nreceiver shall\n\nWhere  a  receiver  is  appointed  in  respect  of  a  freezing  order,  the\n\n(a)\n\ninform the Recovery Authority and the Court as soon as reasonably\npracticable where he thinks that\n\n(i)\n\nany property to which the order applies by virtue of a claim that\nit is\n\n(A)\n\nrecoverable property, is not recoverable property; or\n\n(B)\n\nassociated property, is not associated property;\n\n(ii)\n\nany  property  to  which  the  order  does  not  apply  is  recoverable\nproperty  (in  relation  to  the  same  unlawful  conduct)  or  is\nassociated property;\n\n(iii)\n\nany property to which the order applies is held by a person who\nis different from the person it is claimed holds it; or\n\n(iv)\n\nthere has been any other material change of circumstances;\n\n(b)\n\nreport his findings to the Court; and\n\n\f111\n\n(c)\n\nserve copies of his report on the Recovery Authority and on any person\nwho  holds  any  property  to  which  the  order  applies  or  who  may\notherwise be affected by the report.\n\nVesting and Realisation of Recoverable Property\n\nMaking of recovery order\n\nWhere in proceedings under this Part the Court is satisfied that any\n92.(1)\nproperty  is  recoverable  property,  the  Court  shall  make  an  order  vesting  the\nproperty in a recovery trustee.\n\nThe Recovery Authority may nominate a suitably qualified person to be\n\n(2)\nappointed as the recovery trustee in respect of a recovery order.\n\nThe Court shall not make in a recovery order any provision in respect of\n\n(3)\nany recoverable property where\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\neach of the conditions in subsection (4) is met; and\n\nit would not be just and equitable to do so.\n\n(4)\n\nThe conditions referred to in subsection (3)(a) are that\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe respondent obtained the recoverable property in good faith;\n\nthe respondent\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\ntook any action, or omitted to take any action, after obtaining the\nproperty which he would not have taken, or omitted to take, if he\nhad not obtained the property; or\n\ntook any action, or omitted to take any action, before obtaining the\nproperty, which he would not have taken, or omitted to take, if he\nhad not believed he was going to obtain the property;\n\n(c)\n\nwhen the respondent took, or omitted to take, the action referred to in\nparagraph (b), he had no notice that the property was recoverable; and\n\n\f112\n\n(d)\n\nif a recovery order were made in respect of the property, it would, by\nreason of his action or omission be detrimental to him.\n\n(5)\nIn deciding whether, under subsection (3), it would not be just and equitable\nto make in a recovery order any provision in respect of any recoverable property\nwhere the conditions in subsection (4) are met, the Court shall have regard to\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe degree of detriment that would be suffered by the respondent if the\nprovision were made; and\n\nthe Recovery Authority’s interest in receiving the realised proceeds of\nthe recoverable property.\n\n(6)\n\nThe Court may in a recovery order\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nsever any property;\n\nimpose conditions as to the manner in which a recovery trustee may\ndeal with any property vested by the order for the purpose of realising\nit; and\n\nprovide for payment under section 100 of reasonable legal expenses\nthat  a  person  has  reasonably  incurred,  or  may  reasonably  incur,  in\nrespect of\n\n(i)\n\nthe proceedings under this Part in which the order is made; or\n\n(ii)\n\nany related proceedings under this Part.\n\n(7)\n\nThis section is subject to sections 93 to 100.\n\nFunctions of the Recovery Trustee under Part III\n\n93.(1)\n\nThe functions of a recovery trustee are:\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nto secure the detention, custody or preservation of any property vested\nin him by a recovery order;\n\nin the case of property other than money, to realise the value of the\nproperty for the benefit of the Recovery Authority;\n\n\f113\n\n(c)\n\nto otherwise give effect to the recovery order; and\n\n(d)\n\nto perform any other functions conferred on him by virtue of this Part.\n\n(2)\nIn  performing  his  functions,  a  recovery  trustee  acts  on  behalf  of  the\nRecovery Authority and shall comply with any directions given to him by the\nRecovery Authority.\n\nA recovery trustee shall realise the value of property vested in him by the\n(3)\nrecovery order, so far as practicable, in the manner best calculated to maximise\nthe amount payable to the Recovery Authority.\n\n(4)\n\nA recovery trustee has the power\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nto sell the property or any part of it or interest in it;\n\nto incur expenditure for the purpose of\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\nacquiring any part of the property, or any interest in it, which is\nnot vested in him; or\n\ndischarging any liabilities, or extinguishing any rights, to which\nthe property is subject;\n\n(c)\n\nto manage the property including power\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\nto sell or otherwise dispose of assets comprised in the property\nwhich are perishable or which ought to be disposed of before their\nvalue diminishes;\n\nwhere  the  property  comprises  assets  of  a  trade  or  business,  to\ncarry on, or arrange for another to carry on, the trade or business;\nand\n\n(iii)\n\nto incur capital expenditure in respect of the property;\n\n(d)\n\n(e)\n\nto initiate, carry on or defend any legal proceedings in respect of the\nproperty;\n\nto make any compromise or other arrangement in connection with any\nclaim relating to the property; and\n\n\f114\n\n(f)\n\nfor the purposes of, or in connection with, the exercise of any of his\nother powers\n\n(i)\n\nby his official name to\n\n(A)\n\nhold property;\n\n(B)\n\nenter into contracts;\n\n(C)\n\nsue and be sued;\n\n(D)\n\nemploy agents; and\n\n(E)\n\nexecute a power of attorney, deed or other instrument; and\n\n(ii)\n\nto do any other act which is necessary or expedient.\n\nA reference in this section to a recovery order includes a consent order\n(5)\nmade under section 98 and a reference to property vested in a recovery trustee\nby a recovery order includes property vested in him pursuant to such a consent\norder.\n\nRights of pre-emption\n\nA recovery order shall have effect in relation to any property despite\n94.(1)\nany provision, of whatever nature, which would otherwise prevent, penalise or\nrestrict the vesting of the property.\n\nA right of pre-emption, right of return or other similar right does not operate\n(2)\nor become exercisable as a result of the vesting of any property under a recovery\norder.\n\nIn subsection (2), “right of return” means any right under a provision for\n\n(3)\nthe return or reversion of property in specified circumstances.\n\nWhere property is vested under a recovery order, any right referred to in\n(4)\nsubsection (2) shall have effect as if the person in whom the property is vested\nwere the same person in law as the person who held the property and as if no\ntransfer of the property had taken place.\n\n\f115\n\nReferences to rights in subsections (2), (3) and (4) do not include any rights\n\n(5)\nin respect of which the recovery order was made.\n\n(6)\nThis section applies in relation to the creation of interests, or the doing of\nanything  else,  by  a  recovery  order,  as  it  applies  in  relation  to  the  vesting  of\nproperty.\n\nAssociated and joint property\n\n95.(1)\nSections 96 and 97 apply where the Court makes a recovery order in\nrespect  of  any  recoverable  property  in  any  of  the  circumstances  set  out  in\nsubsection (2).\n\n(2)\n\nThe circumstances referred to in subsection (1) are where\n\n(a)\n\nthe property to which the proceedings relate includes property which\nis associated with the recoverable property and is specified or described\nin  the  application  and,  where  the  associated  property  is  not  the\nrespondent’s property, the application for the recovery order\n\n(i)\n\nhas been served on the person whose property it is; or\n\n(ii)\n\nthe Court has dispensed with service; or\n\n(b)\n\nthe recoverable property belongs to joint tenants and one of the tenants\nis an excepted joint owner.\n\nFor the purposes of this Part “excepted joint owner” means a person who\n(3)\nobtained the property in circumstances in which it would not be recoverable as\nagainst him and references to the excepted joint owner’s share of the recoverable\nproperty are to so much of the recoverable property as would have been his if the\njoint tenancy had been severed.\n\nAgreements on associated and joint property\n\n96.(1)\n\nWhere\n\n(a)\n\nthis section applies; and\n\n\f116\n\n(b)\n\nthe Recovery Authority (on the one hand) and the person who holds\nthe associated property or who is the excepted joint owner (on the other)\nagree,\n\nthe Court may, in the recovery order, instead of vesting the recoverable property\nin a recovery trustee, require the person who holds the associated property or who\nis the excepted joint owner to make a payment to the recovery trustee.\n\nWhere  in  a  recovery  order  the  Court  makes  any  requirement  under\n(2)\nsubsection (1), the Court may, so far as required for giving effect to the agreement,\ninclude provision for vesting, creating or extinguishing any interest in property.\n\nThe amount of the payment to be made under subsection (1) shall be the\n(3)\namount which the Recovery Authority and the person agree represents, in the\ncircumstances specified in\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nsection 95(2)(a), the value of the recoverable property; or\n\nsection 95(2)(b), the value of the recoverable property less the value\nof the excepted joint owner’s share.\n\n(4)\n\nWhere\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\na freezing order applied at any time to the associated property or joint\ntenancy; and\n\nthe Recovery Authority agrees that the person has suffered loss as a\nresult of the freezing order,\n\nthe  amount  of  the  payment  may  be  reduced  by  any  amount  the  Recovery\nAuthority and the person agree is reasonable, having regard to the loss and to any\nother relevant circumstances.\n\n(5)\n\nWhere there is more than one\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nsuch item of associated property; or\n\nexcepted joint owner,\n\n\f117\n\nthe total amount to be paid to the recovery trustee, and the part of that amount\nwhich is to be provided by each person who holds any such associated property\nor who is an excepted joint owner, is to be agreed between both, or all, of them\nand the Recovery Authority.\n\nWhere  in  a  recovery  order  the  Court  makes  any  requirement  under\n(6)\nsubsection (1), the Court shall make provision for any recoverable property to\ncease to be recoverable.\n\nAbsence of agreement on associated and joint property\n\n97.(1)\nin subsections (2) to (6) where\n\nWhere this section applies, the Court may make the provision set out\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthere is no agreement under section 96; and\n\nthe Court thinks it just and equitable to do so.\n\n(2)\n\nThe Court may provide in the recovery order for\n\n(a)\n\nthe associated property to vest in the recovery trustee or, as the case\nmay be, the excepted joint owner’s interest to be extinguished; or\n\n(b)\n\nthe excepted joint owner’s interest to be severed.\n\nWhere the Court makes in a recovery order any provision under subsection\n\n(3)\n(2)(a) the Court may provide for either or both of the following:\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nfor the recovery trustee to pay an amount to the person who holds the\nassociated property or who is an excepted joint owner;\n\nfor the creation of interests in favour of that person, or the imposition\nof  liabilities  or  conditions,  in  relation  to  the  property  vested  in  the\nrecovery trustee.\n\nThe  Court  shall,  in  making  any  provision  in  a  recovery  order  under\n\n(4)\nsubsection (2) or (3), have regard to\n\n(a)\n\nthe rights of any person who holds the associated property or who is\nan excepted joint owner and the value to him of that property or, as the\n\n\f118\n\ncase may be, of his share, including any value which cannot be assessed\nin terms of money; and\n\n(b)\n\nthe Recovery Authority’s interest in receiving the realised proceeds of\nthe recoverable property.\n\n(5)\n\nWhere\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\na freezing order applied at any time to the associated property or joint\ntenancy; and\n\nthe Court is satisfied that the person who holds the associated property\nor who is an excepted joint owner has suffered loss as a result of the\nfreezing order,\n\nthe Court may, in making any provision by virtue of subsection (2) or (3) in a\nrecovery  order,  require  the  Recovery  Authority  to  pay  compensation  to  that\nperson.\n\nThe amount of compensation to be paid under subsection (5) is the amount\n(6)\nthe Court thinks reasonable, having regard to the person’s loss and to any other\nrelevant circumstances.\n\nConsent orders\n\n98.(1)\nThe Court may make an order staying any proceedings for a recovery\norder on terms agreed by the parties for the disposal of the proceedings where\neach person to whose property the proceedings, or the agreement, relates is a\nparty both to the proceedings and the agreement.\n\nAn order under subsection (1) may, in addition to staying the proceedings,\n\n(2)\nmake\n\n(a)\n\nprovision for any property which may be recoverable property to cease\nto be recoverable; and\n\n(b)\n\nany further provision which the Court thinks appropriate.\n\n\f119\n\n(3)\nSection 100 applies to property vested in a recovery trustee, or money paid\nto him, pursuant to an agreement referred to in subsection (1) as it applies to\nproperty vested in him by a recovery order or money paid under section 96.\n\nLimit on recovery\n\n99.(1)\norder in respect of\n\nThis section applies where the Recovery Authority seeks a recovery\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nboth  property  which  is  or  represents  property  obtained  through\nunlawful conduct or tainted property, and related property; or\n\nproperty  which  is  or  represents  property  obtained  through  unlawful\nconduct, or tainted property, where such an order, or an order under\nsection 98, has previously been made in respect of related property.\n\n(2)\n\nFor the purposes of this section\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n“the original property” means the property obtained through unlawful\nconduct or the tainted property, as the case may be; and\n\nthe original property, and any items of property which represent the\noriginal property, are to be treated as related to each other.\n\nThe Court shall not make a recovery order where it thinks that the Recovery\n(3)\nAuthority’s right to recover the original property has been satisfied by a previous\nrecovery order or an order under section 98.\n\nSubject to subsection (3), the Court may act under subsection (5) where it\n\n(4)\nthinks that\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\na recovery order may be made in respect of 2 or more related items of\nrecoverable property; but\n\nthe making of a recovery order in respect of both or all of the related\nitems is not required in order to satisfy the Recovery Authority’s right\nto recover the original property.\n\n\f120\n\n(5)\nThe  Court  may,  in  order  to  satisfy  the  right  of  the  Recovery  Authority\nreferred to in subsection (4)(a) to the extent required, make a recovery order in\nrespect of either or both of the following:\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nonly some of the related items of property;\n\nonly a part of any of the related items of property.\n\nWhere the Court may make a recovery order in respect of any property,\n(6)\nthis section does not prevent the recovery of any profits which have accrued in\nrespect of the property.\n\n(7)\n\nWhere\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nan order is made under section 114, 125 or 128 for the forfeiture of\nrecoverable property; and\n\nthe Recovery Authority subsequently seeks a recovery order in respect\nof related property,\n\nthe order under that section shall be treated for the purposes of this section as if\nit were a recovery order obtained by the Recovery Authority in respect of the\nforfeited property.\n\n(8)\n\nWhere\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nan order is made under section 127 instead of an order being made\nunder section 125 for the forfeiture of recoverable property; and\n\nthe Recovery Authority subsequently seeks a recovery order in respect\nof related property,\n\nthe order under section 127 shall be treated for the purposes of this section as if\nit were a recovery order obtained by the Recovery Authority in respect of the\nproperty that was the forfeitable property in relation to the order under section\n127.\n\n\f(9)\n\nWhere\n\n121\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\npursuant to a judgment in civil proceedings, whether in Barbados or\nelsewhere,  a  claimant  has  obtained  property  from  a  defendant  (“the\njudgment property”);\n\nthe claim was based on the defendant’s having obtained the judgment\nproperty or related property through unlawful conduct; and\n\nthe Recovery Authority subsequently seeks a recovery order in respect\nof property which is related to the judgment property,\n\nthe judgment is to be treated for the purposes of this section as if it were a recovery\norder obtained by the Recovery Authority in respect of the judgment property.\n\n(10)\n\nWhere\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\na forfeiture order is made for the forfeiture of property that, but for the\norder, would have been recoverable property; and\n\nthe Recovery Authority subsequently seeks a recovery order in respect\nof related property,\n\nthe forfeiture order shall be treated for the purposes of this section as if it were a\nrecovery order obtained by the Recovery Authority in respect of the forfeited\nproperty.\n\n(11)\n\nWhere\n\n(a)\n\nproperty has been taken into account in determining the amount of a\nperson’s benefit from criminal conduct for the purpose of making a\nconfiscation order; and\n\n(b)\n\nthe Recovery Authority subsequently seeks a recovery order in respect\nof related property,\n\nthe confiscation order is to be treated for the purposes of this section as if it were\na recovery order obtained by the Recovery Authority in respect of the property\nreferred to in paragraph (a).\n\n\f(12)\n\nIn subsections (10) and (11),\n\n122\n\n“forfeiture  order”  means  an  order  described  in  section  13(2)(b)  or  (c)  or  an\n\nequivalent order under another enactment;\n\n“confiscation order” means\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nan order described in section 13(2)(a); or\n\nan equivalent order under another enactment,\n\nand,  in  relation  to  an  order  specified  in  paragraph  (b),  the  reference  in\nsubsection (11)(a) to the amount of a person’s benefit from criminal conduct\nis to be read as a reference to the corresponding amount under the enactment\nin question.\n\nWithout  prejudice  to  any  other  circumstances  in  which  the  Recovery\n(13)\nAuthority’s right to recover the original property may be satisfied, where there\nis\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\na disposal, other than a part disposal, of the original property, and other\nproperty  (“the  representative  property”)  is  obtained  in  its  place,  the\nRecovery Authority’s right to recover the original property is satisfied\nby  the  making  of  a  recovery  order  in  respect  of  either  the  original\nproperty or the representative property.\n\na  part  disposal  of  the  original  property,  and  other  property  (“the\nrepresentative property”) is obtained in place of the property disposed\nof, the Recovery Authority’s right to recover the original property is\nsatisfied by the making of a recovery order in respect of the remainder\nof the original property together with either the representative property\nor the property disposed of.\n\nIn subsection (13), a part disposal means a disposal to which section 81(1)\n\n(14)\napplies.\n\n\f123\n\nApplication of realised proceeds\n\n100.(1)\ntrustee where they are\n\nSubsection (2) applies to sums which are in the hands of a recovery\n\n(a)\n\nsums  which  represent  the  realised  proceeds  of  property  which  was\nvested in the recovery trustee by a recovery order or which he obtained\npursuant to a recovery order; and\n\n(b)\n\nsums vested in a recovery trustee by a recovery order or obtained by\nhim pursuant to a recovery order.\n\n(2)\n\nThe recovery trustee shall make out of the sums\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nfirst, any payment required to be made by him by virtue of section 97;\n\nnext,  any  payment  of  legal  expenses  which  are  payable  under  this\nsubsection pursuant to provision the Court made in the recovery order\nunder section 92(6)(c); and\n\n(c)\n\nthen  payment  of  any  fees  payable  to  a  liquidator  appointed  by  or\nsupervised by the Court,\n\nand shall pay any sum which remains to the Recovery Authority.\n\nThe Recovery Authority may apply a sum received by it under subsection\n(3)\n(2) in making payment of the remuneration and expenses of any recovery trustee\nor receiver appointed in, or in anticipation of, the proceedings for the recovery\norder.\n\nThe remaining sum, after payments made pursuant to subsection (3), and\n(4)\nany accrued interest on it, shall be paid into the Criminal Assets Recovery Fund\nafter\n\n(a)\n\nthe  period  permitted  under  section  104  to  lodge  an  application  for\ncompensation has expired or the application for compensation has been\ndetermined or disposed of; or\n\n\f124\n\n(b)\n\nthe period within which an appeal may be made or, if a person appeals,\nafter the appeal has been determined or disposed of,\n\nwhichever comes later.\n\nVictims of theft, etc.\n\nExemptions\n\nIn  proceedings  for  a  recovery  order,  a  person  who  claims  that  any\n101.(1)\nproperty alleged to be recoverable property, or any part of the property, belongs\nto him may apply for a declaration to that effect under this section.\n\nThe Court may make a declaration under subsection (1) where it appears\n\n(2)\nto the Court that\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe applicant was deprived of the property he claims, or of property\nwhich it represents, by unlawful conduct;\n\nthe property the applicant was deprived of was not recoverable property\nimmediately before he was deprived of it; and\n\n(c)\n\nthe property he claims belongs to him.\n\nProperty to which a declaration under this section applies is not recoverable\n\n(3)\nproperty.\n\nCases in which proceedings for recovery order shall not be taken\n\n102.(1)\n\nProceedings for a recovery order shall not be taken\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nagainst the Recovery Authority in respect of any recoverable property\nheld by the Recovery Authority;\n\nagainst  any  person  in  respect  of  any  recoverable  property  which  he\nholds by reason of his acting, or having acted, as trustee in bankruptcy\nappointed under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, Cap. 303, or as\nliquidator of a company appointed or supervised by the Court; or\n\n\f125\n\n(c)\n\nin respect of cash found at any place in Barbados unless the proceedings\nare also taken in respect of property other than cash which is property\nof the same person.\n\n(2)\nThe Minister may by Order subject to negative Resolution provide that\nproceedings for a recovery order shall not be taken against any other person in\ncircumstances of a prescribed description and the circumstances may relate to\nthe person himself, to the property or to any other matter.\n\nScope of Powers\n\nScope of powers\n\n103.(1)\nby the Court in respect of\n\nSubject to subsection (2), an order under this Division may be made\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nproperty wherever situated; and\n\na person wherever domiciled, resident or present.\n\n(2)\nAn order under this Division may not be made by the Court in respect of\nproperty  that  is  outside  Barbados,  unless  there  is  or  has  been  a  connection\nbetween the case and Barbados.\n\nThe circumstances in which there is or has been a connection referred to\n\n(3)\nin subsection (2) include those described in the First Schedule.\n\nCompensation where freezing order made but property is not\nrecoverable or associated property\n\n104.(1)\nWhere, in the case of any property to which a freezing order has at\nany time applied, the Court does not in the course of the proceedings decide that\nthe property is recoverable property or associated property, the person whose\nproperty it is may make an application to the Court for compensation.\n\n(2)\n\nSubsection (1) does not apply where the Court makes\n\n(a)\n\na declaration in respect of the property by virtue of section 101; or\n\n\f126\n\n(b)\n\na consent order under section 98.\n\n(3)\nWhere the Court has made a decision by reason of which no recovery order\ncould be made in respect of the property, the application for compensation shall\nbe made within the period of 3 months beginning with\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe date of the decision; or\n\nwhere an application is made for leave to appeal against the decision,\nthe date on which\n\n(i)\n\nthe application is withdrawn or refused; or\n\n(ii)\n\nwhere the application is granted, any proceedings on appeal are\nfinally concluded.\n\nWhere the proceedings in respect of the property have been discontinued,\n(4)\nthe application for compensation shall be made within the period of 3 months\nbeginning with the discontinuance.\n\nWhere the Court is satisfied that the applicant has suffered loss as a result\n(5)\nof  the  freezing  order,  the  Court  may  require  the  Recovery  Authority  to  pay\ncompensation to the applicant.\n\nWhere, but for section 94(2), any right mentioned in that section would\n(6)\nhave operated in favour of, or become exercisable by, any person, the person may\nmake an application to the Court for compensation.\n\nThe  application  for  compensation  under  subsection  (6)  shall  be  made\n(7)\nwithin the period of 3 months beginning with the vesting referred to in section\n94(2).\n\nWhere the Court is satisfied that, in consequence of the operation of section\n(8)\n94, the right in question cannot subsequently operate in favour of the applicant\nor, as the case may be, become exercisable by him, the Court may require the\nRecovery Authority to pay compensation to him.\n\n\f127\n\n(9)\nThe amount of compensation to be paid under this section is the amount\nthe  Court  thinks  reasonable  having  regard  to  the  loss  suffered  and  any  other\nrelevant circumstances.\n\nFinancial threshold\n\n105.(1)\na threshold for the purposes of this section.\n\nThe Minister may by Order subject to negative Resolution prescribe\n\nWhere  a  threshold  is  prescribed  under  subsection  (1),  the  Recovery\n(2)\nAuthority shall not initiate proceedings for a recovery order unless the Recovery\nAuthority  reasonably  believes  that  the  aggregate  value  of  the  recoverable\nproperty which the Recovery Authority wishes to be subject to a recovery order\nis equal to or greater than the prescribed threshold.\n\nWhere the Recovery Authority applies for a freezing order before initiating\n(3)\nproceedings for a recovery order, subsection (2) applies to the application for the\nfreezing order instead of to the initiation of the proceedings.\n\nThis section does not affect the continuation of proceedings for a recovery\n(4)\norder which have been properly started or the making or continuing effect of a\nfreezing order which has been properly applied for.\n\nLimitation\n\n106.(1)\nProceedings shall not be brought for a recovery order in respect of any\nrecoverable property after the expiration of 20 years, in the case of proceedings\nfor a recovery order in respect of\n\n(a)\n\nproperty obtained through unlawful conduct, from when the property\nwas so obtained;\n\n(b)\n\ntainted property, from when the property became tainted property; or\n\n(c)\n\nany  other  recoverable  property,  from  when  the  property  obtained\nthrough  unlawful  conduct  which  the  other  recoverable  property\nrepresents was so obtained.\n\n\f128\n\nFor the purposes of subsection (1), proceedings for a recovery order are\n\n(2)\nbrought when an application is\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nfiled with the Court under section 82; or\n\nmade for a freezing order.\n\nProperty acquired before commencement date\n\nFor

relevant time.\n\nDivision 3\n\nRecovery of Cash in Summary Proceedings\n\nInterpretation of sections 109 to 118\n\nFor the purposes of sections 109 to 118“recoverable cash” means cash\n108.(1)\nwhich is recoverable property or is intended by any person for use in unlawful\nconduct.\n\nThe amount of cash held in a currency other than Barbados dollars shall\n\n(2)\nbe its equivalent in Barbados dollars at the prevailing rate of exchange.\n\nSearches for recoverable cash\n\n109.(1)\n\nA law enforcement officer who\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nis lawfully on any premises; and\n\nhas reasonable grounds for suspecting that there is recoverable cash on\nthe premises,\n\nmay search for the cash on the premises.\n\n\f129\n\nWhere a law enforcement officer has reasonable grounds for suspecting\n\n(2)\nthat a person (“the suspect”) is carrying recoverable cash, the officer may\n\n(a)\n\nso  far  as  he  thinks  it  necessary  or  expedient,  require  the  suspect  to\npermit a search of\n\n(i)\n\nany article the suspect has with him; and\n\n(ii)\n\nhis person; and\n\n(b)\n\nfor the purposes of exercising his power under paragraph (a)(ii), detain\nthe suspect for so long as is necessary for the exercise of that power.\n\n(3)\n\nThe powers conferred by this section are exercisable\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nonly so far as reasonably required for the purpose of finding the cash;\nand\n\nby a law enforcement officer who is a customs officer only where he\nhas reasonable grounds to believe that the unlawful conduct in question\nrelates to an assigned matter.\n\n(4)\n\nThis section does not require a person to submit to an intimate search.\n\nSeizure of cash\n\n110.\ngrounds for suspecting that\n\nA law enforcement officer may seize cash where he has reasonable\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe cash is recoverable cash; or\n\npart of the cash is recoverable cash and it is not reasonably practicable\nto seize only that part.\n\nDetention of seized cash\n\n111.(1)\nWhere a law enforcement officer who has seized cash under section\n110 continues to have reasonable grounds for his suspicion, the cash seized under\nthat section may be detained initially for a period of 72 hours.\n\n\f130\n\n(2)\nThe period for which the cash or any part of it may be detained may be\nextended by a magistrate by order, but the order may not authorise the detention\nof any of the cash\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nbeyond the end of the period of 3 months beginning with the date of\nthe order; or\n\nin the case of any further order under this section, beyond the end of\nthe period of 2 years beginning with the date of the first order.\n\nAn application for an order under subsection (2) may be made by a senior\n(3)\nlaw  enforcement  officer,  and  the  magistrate  may  make  the  order  where  he  is\nsatisfied, in relation to any cash to be further detained, that there are reasonable\ngrounds for suspecting that the cash is\n\n(a)\n\nrecoverable cash and that\n\n(i)\n\nits continued detention is justified while its derivation is further\ninvestigated  or  consideration  is  given  to  bringing  proceedings,\nwhether in or outside Barbados, against any person for an offence\nwith which the cash is connected; or\n\n(ii)\n\nproceedings against any person for an offence with which the cash\nis connected have been instituted and have not been concluded; or\n\n(b)\n\nintended to be used in unlawful conduct and that\n\n(i)\n\nits continued detention is justified while its intended use is further\ninvestigated  or  consideration  is  given  to  bringing  proceedings,\nwhether  in  Barbados  or  elsewhere,  against  any  person  for  an\noffence with which the cash is connected; or\n\n(ii)\n\nproceedings against any person for an offence with which the cash\nis connected have been instituted and have not been concluded.\n\n\f131\n\n(4)\nWhere  an  application  for  an  order  under  subsection  (2)  relates  to  cash\nseized  under  section  110(b),  the  magistrate  may  make  the  order  where  he  is\nsatisfied that\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nsubsection (3)(a) or (b) applies in respect of part of the cash; and\n\nit is not reasonably practicable to detain only that part.\n\nAn order under subsection (2) shall provide for notice to be given to any\n\n(5)\nperson affected by it.\n\nInterest on detained cash\n\nWhere cash is detained under section 111 for more than a period of\n112.(1)\n72 hours, the cash shall, at the first opportunity, be paid by the law enforcement\nofficer into an interest-bearing account and held there, and the interest accruing\non it is to be added to it on its forfeiture or release.\n\nIn the case of cash detained under section 111 which was seized under\n(2)\nsection 110(b), the law enforcement officer, shall as soon as practicable after\npaying the cash seized into an interest-bearing account, release the part of the\ncash to which the suspicion does not relate.\n\nSubsection (1) does not apply where the cash or, as the case may be, the\n(3)\npart  to  which  the  suspicion  relates,  is  required  as  evidence  of  an  offence  or\nevidence in proceedings under this Division.\n\nRelease of detained cash\n\n113.(1)\nWhere cash is detained under section 111, a magistrate may order the\nrelease of the whole or any part of the cash where the magistrate is satisfied, on\nan application by the person from whom the cash was seized, that the grounds\nfor the detention of the cash specified in section 111(3) or (4) are no longer met\nin relation to the cash to be released.\n\nThe Commissioner of Police or the Comptroller of Customs, as the case\n(2)\nmay be, or an authorised representative of either functionary may, after notifying\nthe magistrate under whose order cash is being detained or where that magistrate\n\n\f132\n\nis unavailable, another magistrate, release the whole or any part of the cash where\nhe is satisfied that the detention of the cash to be released is no longer justified.\n\nMaking of cash forfeiture order\n\n114.(1)\nWhere cash is detained under section 111, a police officer may apply\nto a magistrate for an order for the forfeiture of the whole or any part of the cash.\n\nThe magistrate may order the forfeiture of the cash, or any part of it, where\n\n(2)\nhe is satisfied that the cash or the part of the cash is\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nrecoverable cash; or\n\nintended by any person for use in unlawful conduct.\n\nIn the case of recoverable cash which belongs to joint proprietors, one of\n(3)\nwhom is an excepted joint owner, the order shall not apply to so much of the cash\nas the magistrate thinks is attributable to the excepted joint owner’s share.\n\nWhere  an  application  for  the  forfeiture  of  any  cash  is  made  under  this\n(4)\nsection, the cash shall be detained (and may not be released under any power\nconferred  by  this  Division)  until  any  proceedings  pursuant  to  the  application,\nincluding any proceedings on appeal, are concluded.\n\nAppeal against cash forfeiture order\n\n115.(1)\nAny party to proceedings for a cash forfeiture order who is aggrieved\nby the making of the order or the decision of the magistrate not to make the order\nmay appeal to the Court.\n\n(2)\n\nAn appeal under subsection (1) shall\n\n(a)\n\nbe made within the period of 30 days commencing on the date on which\nthe order was made or the decision not to make the order was taken;\nand\n\n(b)\n\nbe by way of a rehearing by the Court which may make any order that\nit considers appropriate.\n\n\f133\n\nWhere the Court upholds an appeal against a cash forfeiture order, it may\n\n(3)\norder the release of the whole or any part of the cash.\n\nApplication of forfeited cash\n\n116.\nAfter the period within which an appeal under section 115 may be\nmade or, where a person appeals under that section, after the appeal has been\ndetermined or disposed of, cash forfeited under section 114, and any accrued\ninterest on it, shall be paid into the Criminal Assets Recovery Fund.\n\nVictims and other owners of cash\n\nA person who claims that any cash, or any part of it, that is detained\n117.(1)\nunder this Division belongs to him, may apply to the magistrate for the cash or\nthe part of it to be released to him.\n\nAn application under subsection (1) may be made in the course of detention\n\n(2)\nor forfeiture proceedings or at any other time.\n\n(3)\n\nWhere, on an application, it appears to the magistrate that\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe applicant was deprived of the cash to which the application relates,\nor of property which the cash represents, by unlawful conduct;\n\nthe property the applicant was deprived of was not, immediately before\nhe was deprived of it, recoverable property; and\n\n(c)\n\nthe cash belongs to him,\n\nthe magistrate may order the cash to which the application relates to be released\nto the applicant.\n\nThe magistrate may order the cash to which an application relates to be\n\n(4)\nreleased to the applicant or to the person from whom it was seized where\n\n(a)\n\nthe  applicant  is  not  the  person  from  whom  the  cash  to  which  the\napplication relates was seized;\n\n(b)\n\nit appears to the magistrate that the cash belongs to the applicant;\n\n\f134\n\n(c)\n\nthe magistrate is satisfied that the grounds specified in section 111(3)\nor  (4)  for  the  detention  of  the  cash  are  no  longer  met  or,  where  an\napplication has been made under section 114, the Court decides not to\nmake an order under that section in relation to the cash; and\n\n(d)\n\nno objection to the making of an order under this subsection has been\nmade by the person from whom that cash was seized.\n\nCompensation where cash detained but not forfeited\n\nWhere no cash forfeiture order is made in respect of any cash detained\n118.(1)\nunder this Division, the person to whom the cash belongs or from whom it was\nseized  may  make  an  application  to  a  magistrate  for  compensation  for  the\ndetention.\n\nWhere, for any period beginning with the first opportunity to place the cash\n(2)\nin an interest-bearing account after the initial detention of the cash for a period\nof 72 hours, the cash was not held in an interest-bearing account while detained,\nthe magistrate may order an amount of compensation to be paid to the applicant.\n\nThe amount of compensation to be paid under subsection (2) is the amount\n(3)\nthe magistrate thinks would have been earned in interest in the period in question\nif the cash had been held in an interest-bearing account.\n\nWhere the magistrate is satisfied that, taking account of any interest to be\n(4)\npaid  under  section  112  or  any  amount  to  be  paid  under  subsection  (2),  the\napplicant has suffered loss as a result of the detention of the cash and that the\ncircumstances  are  exceptional,  the  magistrate  may  order  compensation,  or\nadditional compensation, to be paid to him.\n\nThe amount of compensation to be paid under subsection (4) is the amount\n(5)\nthe magistrate thinks reasonable having regard to the loss suffered and any other\nrelevant circumstances.\n\nCompensation under this section shall be paid from the Criminal Assets\n\n(6)\nRecovery Fund.\n\n\f135\n\nWhere a cash forfeiture order is made in respect only of a part of any cash\n\n(7)\ndetained, this section has effect in relation to the other part.\n\nDivision 4\n\nRecovery of Listed Assets in Summary Proceedings\n\nMeaning of listed assets\n\n119.(1)\n\nIn

vouchers;\n\n(f)\n\npostage stamps;\n\n“precious metals” means gold, silver or platinum, whether in an unmanufactured\n\nor a manufactured state.\n\nThe  Minister  may  by  Order  subject  to  negative  Resolution  amend\n\n(2)\nsubsection (1) by\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nremoving a description of property; or\n\nadding a description of personal property.\n\n\f136\n\nSearches for seizable listed assets\n\n120.(1)\n\nA law enforcement officer who\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nis lawfully on any premises; and\n\nhas  reasonable  grounds  for  suspecting  that  there  is  a  seizable  listed\nasset on the premises,\n\nmay search for the listed asset on the premises.\n\nWhere a law enforcement officer has reasonable grounds for suspecting\n(2)\nthat  a  person  (“the  suspect”)  is  carrying  the  seizable  listed  asset,  the  officer\nmay\n\n(a)\n\nso  far  as  he  thinks  it  necessary  or  expedient,  require  the  suspect  to\npermit a search of\n\n(i)\n\nany article the suspect has with him; and\n\n(ii)\n\nhis person; and\n\n(b)\n\nfor the purposes of exercising his power under paragraph (a)(ii), detain\nthe suspect for so long as is necessary for the exercise of that power.\n\n(3)\n\nThe powers conferred by this section are exercisable\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nonly so far as reasonably required for the purpose of finding the listed\nasset; and\n\nby a law enforcement officer who is a customs officer only where he\nhas reasonable grounds to believe that the unlawful conduct in question\nrelates to an assigned matter.\n\nThis section does not require a person to submit to an intimate search.\n\nFor the purposes of this section, a listed asset is a seizable listed asset where\n\n(a)\n\nall or part of it is recoverable property or is intended by any person for\nuse in unlawful conduct; and\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\n\f137\n\n(b)\n\nthe value of the asset, or the part of it that falls within paragraph (a), is\nnot less than such value as may be prescribed by the Minister by Order\nsubject to negative Resolution.\n\n(6)\nWhere a power conferred by this section is being exercised in respect of\nmore than one seizable listed asset, this section applies as if the value of each\nasset or, as the case may be, part of an asset were equal to the aggregate value of\nall of those assets or parts.\n\nThe  powers  conferred  by  subsections  (1)  to  (6)  on  a  law  enforcement\n(7)\nofficer include the power to carry out, or arrange for the carrying out of, tests on\nanything found during the course of the search for the purpose of establishing\nwhether it is a listed asset.\n\nSeizure of listed assets\n\n121.(1)\nhas reasonable grounds for suspecting that\n\nA law enforcement officer may seize any item of property where he\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nit is a listed asset;\n\nit is recoverable property or intended by any person for use in unlawful\nconduct; and\n\nthe value of it is not less than the value prescribed under section 120(5)\n(b).\n\n(2)\n\nA law enforcement officer may also seize any item of property where\n\n(a)\n\nhe has reasonable grounds for suspecting that\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\nthe item is a listed asset;\n\npart of the item is recoverable property or intended by any person\nfor use in unlawful conduct; and\n\n(iii)\n\nthe value of the part to which the suspicion relates is not less than\nthe value prescribed under section 120(5)(b); and\n\n(b)\n\nit is not reasonably practicable to seize only that part.\n\n\f138\n\nWhere a power conferred by this section is being exercised in respect of\n(3)\nmore than one item of property, this section applies as if the value of each item\nwere equal to the aggregate value of all of those items.\n\n(4)\nThe references in subsection (3) to the value of an item are to be read as\nincluding references to the value of part of an item where the power conferred\nby subsection (2) is being exercised whether alone or in conjunction with the\npower conferred by subsection (1).\n\nDetention of seized property\n\nWhere  a  law  enforcement  officer  who  has  seized  property  under\n122.(1)\nsection 121 continues to have reasonable grounds for his suspicion in relation to\nthe property, the property seized under that section may be detained initially for\na period of 72 hours.\n\nThe period for which the property or any part of it may be detained may\n(2)\nbe  extended  by  a  magistrate  by  order,  but  the  order  may  not  authorise  the\ndetention of any of the property\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nbeyond the end of the period of 3 months beginning with the date of\nthe order; or\n\nin the case of any further order under this section, beyond the end of\nthe period of 2 years beginning with the date of the first order.\n\nAn application for an order under subsection (2) may be made by a senior\n(3)\nlaw  enforcement  officer,  and  the  magistrate  may  make  the  order  where  he  is\nsatisfied, in relation to any item of property to be further detained, that\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe property is a listed asset;\n\nthe value of the property is not less than the value prescribed under\nsection 120(5)(b); and\n\n\f139\n\n(c)\n\nthere  are  reasonable  grounds  for  suspecting  that  the  property  is\nrecoverable property and that\n\n(i)\n\nits continued detention is justified while its derivation is further\ninvestigated  or  consideration  is  given  to  bringing  proceedings,\nwhether  in  Barbados  or  elsewhere,  against  any  person  for  an\noffence with which the property is connected; or\n\n(ii)\n\nproceedings  against  any  person  for  an  offence  with  which  the\nproperty  is  connected  have  been  instituted  and  have  not  been\nconcluded; or\n\n(d)\n\nthere  are  reasonable  grounds  for

person  for  an  offence  with  which  the\nproperty  is  connected  have  been  instituted  and  have  not  been\nconcluded.\n\nWhere an application for an order under subsection (2) relates to an item\n(4)\nof property seized under section 121(2), the magistrate may make the order where\nhe is satisfied that\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nthe item of property is a listed asset;\n\nsubsection (3)(c) or (d) applies in respect of part of the item;\n\nthe value of that part is not less than the value prescribed under section\n120(5)(b); and\n\n(d)\n\nit is not reasonably practicable to detain only that part.\n\nWhere an application for an order under subsection (2) is made in respect\n(5)\nof two or more items of property that were seized at the same time and by the\n\n\f140\n\nsame person, this section applies as if the value of each item were equal to the\naggregate value of all of those items.\n\nThe references in subsection (5) to the value of an item are to be read as\n(6)\nincluding references to the value of part of an item where subsection (4) applies\nin relation to one or more of the items in respect of which the application under\nsubsection (2) is made.\n\nAn order under subsection (2) shall provide for notice to be given to any\n\n(7)\nperson affected by it.\n\nSubsections (3)(b) and (4)(c) do not apply where the application is for a\n\n(8)\nsecond or subsequent order under this section.\n\nTesting and safekeeping of property seized under section 121\n\n123.\n\nA law enforcement officer\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nmay carry out, or arrange for the carrying out of, tests on any item of\nproperty  seized  under  section  121  for  the  purpose  of  establishing\nwhether it is a listed asset; and\n\nshall arrange for any item of property seized under section 121 to be\nsafely stored throughout the period during which it is detained under\nthis Division.\n\nRelease of detained property\n\n124.(1)\nWhere property is detained under section 122, a magistrate may order\nthe  release  of  the  whole  or  any  part  of  the  property  where  the  magistrate  is\nsatisfied, on an application by the person from whom the property was seized,\nthat the grounds for the detention of the property specified in section 122 are no\nlonger met in relation to the property to be released.\n\nThe Commissioner of Police or the Comptroller of Customs, as the case\n(2)\nmay be, or an authorised representative of either functionary may, after notifying\nthe  magistrate  under  whose  order  property  is  being  detained  or,  where  that\nmagistrate is unavailable, another magistrate, release the whole or any part of the\n\n\f141\n\nproperty, where he is satisfied that the detention of the property to be released is\nno longer justified.\n\nMaking of listed asset forfeiture order\n\n125.(1)\nWhere property is detained under this Division, a police officer may\napply to a magistrate for an order for the forfeiture of the whole or any part of\nthe property.\n\nThe magistrate may order the forfeiture of the property, or any part of the\n\n(2)\nproperty, where he is satisfied that\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe property or the part of the property is a listed asset; and\n\nwhat is to be forfeited is recoverable property or intended by a person\nfor use in unlawful conduct.\n\nAn order under subsection (2) may provide for the payment under section\n(3)\n130 of reasonable legal expenses that a person has reasonably incurred, or may\nreasonably incur, in respect of\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe proceedings in which the order is

section.\n\n(5)\nWhere an application for the forfeiture of any property is made under this\nsection, the property is to be detained (and may not be released under any power\nconferred  by  this  Division)  until  any  proceedings  pursuant  to  the  application,\nincluding any proceedings on appeal, are concluded.\n\nWhere the property to which the application relates is being detained under\n(6)\nthis Division as part of an item of property, having been seized under section\n121, subsection (5) shall be read as if it required the continued detention of the\nwhole of the item of property.\n\n\f142\n\nAssociated and joint property in relation to listed assets\n\n126.(1)\n\nSections 127 and 128 apply where\n\n(a)\n\nan application is made under section 125 in respect of property detained\nunder this Division;\n\n(b)\n\nthe magistrate is satisfied that\n\n(i)\n\nthe property is a listed asset; and\n\n(ii)\n\nall or part of the property is recoverable property or

(b).\n\n(2)\n\nSections 127 and 128 also apply where\n\n(a)\n\nan application is made under section 125 in respect of property detained\nunder this Division;\n\n(b)\n\nthe magistrate is satisfied

mentioned\nin paragraph (b) belongs to joint tenants and one of the tenants is an\nexcepted joint owner.\n\n(3)\n\nFor the purpose of this Division,\n\n“associated property” means, in relation to forfeitable property, property of any\nof  the  following  descriptions,  including  property  held  by  a  respondent,\nwhich is not itself the forfeitable property:\n\n(a)\n\nany interest in the

(1)(b) or (2)(b), as the case may be.\n\nAgreements on associated and joint property in relation to listed assets\n\n127.(1)\n\nWhere\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthis section applies; and\n\nthe Recovery Authority (on the one hand) and the person who holds\nthe associated property or who is the excepted joint owner (on the other)\nagree,\n\nthe magistrate may, instead of making a listed asset forfeiture order, make an\norder  requiring  the  person  who  holds  the  associated  property  or  who  is  the\nexcepted joint owner to make a payment to such person as he may specify in the\norder.\n\nThe amount of the payment to be made under subsection (1) shall, subject\n(2)\nto subsection (3), be the amount which the Recovery Authority and the person\nagree represents, in the circumstances specified in\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nsection 126(1), the value of the forfeitable property; or\n\nsection 126(2), the value of the forfeitable property less the value of\nthe excepted joint owner’s share.\n\n\f144\n\n(3)\nThe amount of the payment may be reduced where the Recovery Authority\nagrees that the other party to the agreement has suffered loss as a result of the\nseizure  of  the  forfeitable  property  and  any  associated  property  under  section\n121 and its subsequent detention.\n\nThe reduction that is permissible under subsection (3) is such amount as\n(4)\nthe parties to the agreement agree is reasonable having regard to the loss suffered\nand any other relevant circumstances.\n\nAn order under subsection (1) may, so far as required for giving effect to\n(5)\nthe  agreement,  include  provision  for  vesting,  creating  or  extinguishing  any\ninterest in property.\n\nAn  order  under  subsection  (1)  may  provide  for  the  payment  under\n(6)\nsubsection (9) of reasonable legal expenses that a person has reasonably incurred,\nor may reasonably incur, in respect of\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe proceedings in which the order is made; or\n\nany related proceedings under this Division.\n\nFor  the  purposes  of  section  77(2),  on  the  making  of  an  order  under\n(7)\nsubsection (1), the forfeitable property shall be treated as if it had been forfeited.\n\nWhere there is more than one item of associated property or more than one\n(8)\nexcepted joint owner, the total amount to be paid under subsection (1), and the\npart of that amount which is to be provided by each person who holds any such\nassociated property or who is an excepted joint owner, is to be agreed between\nboth or all of them and the Recovery Authority.\n\nAn amount received under an order under subsection (1) shall be applied\n\n(9)\nas follows:\n\n(a)\n\nfirst, it must be applied in making any payment of legal expenses which\nare  payable  under  this  subsection  in  pursuance  of  provision  under\nsubsection (6);\n\n\f145\n\n(b)\n\nsecond,  it  must  be  applied  in  payment  or  reimbursement  of  any\nreasonable costs incurred in storing or insuring the forfeitable property\nand any associated property while it was detained under this Division;\n\n(c)\n\nthird, it must be paid into the Criminal Assets Recovery Fund.\n\nAbsence of agreement on associated and joint property in relation to\nlisted assets\n\n128.(1)\n127, the magistrate\n\nWhere this section applies and there is no agreement under section\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nshall, where the value of the forfeitable property and any associated\nproperty is equal to or more than such amount as may be prescribed by\nthe Minister by Order; and\n\nmay, where the value of the forfeitable property and any associated\nproperty is less than such amount as may be prescribed by the Minister\nby Order,\n\ntransfer the application for a listed asset forfeiture order to the Court.\n\nWhere an application is transferred to it, the Court may order the forfeiture\n(2)\nof the property to which the application relates, or any part of that property, where\nit is satisfied that\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe property or the part of the property is a listed asset; and\n\nwhat is to be forfeited is recoverable property or intended by a person\nfor use in unlawful conduct.\n\nAn order under subsection (2) may include provision of the type that may\n\n(3)\nbe included in an order made under section 125.\n\nThe Court may, in addition to making an order under subsection (2), make\n\n(4)\nan order for\n\n(a)\n\nthe forfeiture of the associated property or, as the case may be, for the\nexcepted joint owner's interest to be extinguished; or\n\n\f146\n\n(b)\n\nthe excepted joint owner's interest to be severed.\n\n(5)\nWhere the magistrate decides not to transfer an application referred to in\nsubsection (1), the magistrate may, in addition to making an order under section\n125(2), make an order for\n\n(a)\n\nthe forfeiture of the associated property or, as the case may be, for the\nexcepted joint owner's interest to be extinguished; or\n\n(b)\n\nthe excepted joint owner's interest to be severed.\n\n(6)\n\nAn order under subsection (4) or (5)\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nmay be made only where the Court or the magistrate, as the case may\nbe, thinks it just and equitable to do so; and\n\nshall provide for the payment of an amount to the person who holds\nthe associated property or who is the excepted joint owner.\n\nIn making an order under subsection (4) or (5), and including provision in\n(7)\nit by virtue of subsection (6), the Court or the magistrate, as the case may be,\nshall have regard to\n\n(a)\n\nthe rights of any person who holds the associated property or who is\nan excepted joint owner and the value to that person of that property\nor, as the case may be, of that person's share, including any value that\ncannot be assessed in terms of money; and\n\n(b)\n\nthe  interest  of  the  Recovery  Authority  in  realising  the  value  of  the\nforfeitable property.\n\n(8)\n\nWhere the Court or the magistrate, as the case may be, is satisfied that\n\n(a)\n\nthe person who holds the associated property or who is the excepted\njoint owner has suffered loss as a result of the seizure of the forfeitable\nproperty and any associated property and its subsequent detention; and\n\n(b)\n\nthe circumstances are exceptional, an order under subsection (4) or (5)\nmay require the payment of compensation to that person.\n\n\f147\n\nThe amount of compensation to be paid under subsection (8) is the amount\n(9)\nthe Court or the magistrate, as the case may be, thinks reasonable, having regard\nto the person’s loss and to any other relevant circumstances.\n\nCompensation to be paid under subsection (9) shall be paid in the same\n\n(10)\nway that compensation is to be paid under section 132.\n\nAppeal against listed asset forfeiture order\n\n129.(1)\nagainst\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nAny party to proceedings for a listed asset forfeiture order may appeal\n\nthe making of the order under section 125 or128;\n\nthe decision not to make the order under section 125, unless the reason\nthat no order was made is that an order was instead made under section\n127;\n\n(c)\n\nthe decision not to make the order under section 128(5).\n\nSubsection (1)(b) and (c) do not apply where the application for the order\n\n(2)\nunder section 125 was transferred in accordance with section 128.\n\n(3)\n\nAn appeal under subsection (1) shall\n\n(a)\n\nbe made within the period of 30 days commencing on the date on which\nthe order was made or the decision not to make the order was taken;\nand\n\n(b)\n\nbe by way of a rehearing by the relevant court which may make any\norder that it considers appropriate.\n\nWhere the relevant court upholds an appeal against a listed asset forfeiture\n(3)\norder, it may order the release of the whole or any part of the property involved.\n\nRealisation of forfeited property and proceeds of realisation\n\nAfter the period within which an appeal under section 129 may be\n130.(1)\nmade or, where a person appeals under that section, after the appeal has been\n\n\f148\n\ndetermined or disposed of, the Recovery Authority shall realise the property, and\nfor the purpose, may appoint a suitably qualified person to do so on its behalf.\n\nThe realisation of property under subsection (1) shall be carried out, so far\n(2)\nas practicable, in the manner best calculated to maximise the amount obtained\nfor the property.\n\nThe proceeds of property realised under subsection (1) shall be applied as\n\n(3)\nfollows:\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nfirst, they shall be applied in making any payment required to be made\nunder section 128(8);\n\nsecond, they shall be applied in making any payment of legal expenses\nwhich  are  payable  under  this  subsection  in  pursuance  of  provision\nunder section 125 or 127;\n\nthird, they shall be applied in making any payment or reimbursement\nof  any  reasonable  costs  incurred  in  storing  or  insuring  the  property\nwhilst detained under this Division and in realising the property;\n\n(d)\n\nfourth, they shall be paid into the Criminal Assets Recovery Fund.\n\nWhere what is realised under section (1) represents part only of an item of\n(4)\nproperty seized and detained under this Division, the reference in subsection (3)\n(c) to costs incurred in storing or insuring the property is to be read as a reference\nto costs incurred in storing or insuring the whole of the item of property.\n\nVictims and other owners of detained property\n\n131.(1)\nA person who claims that any property, or any part of it, that is detained\nunder this Division belongs to him, may apply to the magistrate for the property\nor the part of it to be released to him.\n\nAn application under subsection (1) may be made in the course of detention\n\n(2)\nor forfeiture proceedings or at any other time.\n\n\f149\n\n(3)\n\nWhere, on an application, it appears to the magistrate that\n\n(a)\n\nthe  applicant  was  deprived  of  the  property  to  which  the  application\nrelates,  or  of  property  which  the  property  represents,  by  unlawful\nconduct;\n\n(b)\n\nthe property the applicant was deprived of was not, immediately before\nhe was deprived of it, recoverable property; and\n\n(c)\n\nthe property belongs to the applicant,\n\nthe magistrate may order the property to be released to the applicant.\n\nThe magistrate may order the property to which an application relates to\n\n(4)\nbe released to the applicant or to the person from whom it was seized where\n\n(a)\n\nthe applicant is not the person from whom the property to which the\napplication relates was seized;\n\n(b)\n\nit appears to the magistrate that the property belongs to the applicant;\n\n(c)\n\nthe magistrate is satisfied that the grounds specified in section 122 for\nthe detention of the property are no longer met or, where an application\nhas been made for a listed asset forfeiture order, the court decided not\nto make the order in relation to the property; and\n\n(d)\n\nno objection to the making of an order under this section has been made\nby the person from whom that property was seized.\n\nCompensation where property detained but not forfeited\n\n132.(1)\nWhere no order under section 125, 127 or 128 is made in respect of\nany  property  detained  under  this  Division,  the  person  to  whom  the  property\nbelongs or from whom it was seized may make an application to a magistrate for\ncompensation for the detention.\n\nWhere the magistrate is satisfied that the applicant has suffered loss as a\n(2)\nresult of the detention of the property and that the circumstances are exceptional,\nthe magistrate may order compensation to be paid to him.\n\n\f150\n\n(3)\nThe amount of compensation to be paid under subsection (2) is the amount\nthe magistrate thinks reasonable having regard to the loss suffered and any other\nrelevant circumstances.\n\nCompensation under this section shall be paid from the Criminal Assets\n\n(4)\nRecovery Fund.\n\nWhere a listed asset forfeiture order is made in respect only of a part of\n\n(5)\nany property detained, this section has effect in relation to the other part.\n\nPART IV\n\nINVESTIGATIONS\n\nDivision 1\n\nPreliminary to Part IV\n\nInterpretation and application

satisfied that each of the requirements set out in section\n136 is fulfilled, make an order requiring a person (“the respondent”) to provide\na statement\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nsetting  out  the  nature  and  extent  of  the  respondent's  interest  in  the\nproperty in respect of which the order is made;\n\nexplaining  how  the  respondent  obtained  the  property,  including,  in\nparticular, how any costs incurred in obtaining the property were met;\nand\n\n(c)\n\nsetting out such other information in connection with the property as\nmay be so specified.\n\n\f153\n\n(2)\n\nAn application for an unexplained wealth order\n\n(a)\n\nshall\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\nspecify or describe the property in respect of which the order is\nsought; and\n\nspecify the person whom the Recovery Authority thinks holds the\nproperty, and the person specified may include a person outside\nBarbados; and\n\n(b)\n\nmay be made without notice.\n\n(3)\n\nAn unexplained wealth order\n\n(a)\n\nshall specify\n\n(i)\n\nthe form and manner in which the statement is to be given;\n\n(ii)\n\nthe person to whom it is to be given; and\n\n(iii)\n\nthe place at which it is to be given or, where it is to be given in\nwriting, the address to which it is to be sent; and\n\n(b)\n\nmay,  in  connection  with  requiring  the  respondent  to  provide  the\nstatement, also require the respondent to produce documents of a kind\nspecified or described in the order.\n\nA respondent against whom an unexplained order is made shall comply\n(4)\nwith the requirements imposed by the order within such period as the judge may\nspecify,  and  different  periods  may  be  specified  in  relation  to  different\nrequirements.\n\nA person who, in purported compliance with a requirement imposed by an\n\n(5)\nunexplained wealth order,\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nmakes a statement that the person knows to be false or misleading in a\nmaterial particular; or\n\nrecklessly makes a statement that is false or misleading in a material\nparticular,\n\n\fis guilty of an offence.\n\n154\n\nAn offence under subsection (5) is punishable upon summary conviction\n\n(6)\nby\n\n(a)\n\na  fine  of  $10,000  or  imprisonment  for  2  years,  or  both,  where  the\noffender is an individual;\n\n(b)\n\na fine of $50,000, where the offender is a body corporate.\n\nRequirements for making of unexplained wealth order\n\n136.(1)\n\nThe requirements referred to in section 135(1) are that\n\n(a)\n\nthere are reasonable grounds for suspecting that\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\nthe respondent holds the property;\n\nthe value of the property is more than such amount as may be\nprescribed by the Minister by Order; and\n\nthe known sources of the respondent’s lawfully obtained income\nwould  have  been  insufficient  for  the  purposes  of  enabling  the\nrespondent to obtain the property; and\n\n(b)\n\nthe respondent is a politically exposed person; or\n\n(c)\n\nthere are reasonable grounds for suspecting that\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\nthe  respondent  is,  or  has  been,  involved  in  unlawful  conduct,\nwhether in Barbados or elsewhere; or\n\na  person  connected  with  the  respondent  is,  or  has  been,  so\ninvolved.\n\n(2)\n\nIt does not matter for the purposes of subsection (1)(a)(i)\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nwhether or not there are other persons who also hold the property;\n\nwhether the property was obtained by the respondent before or after\nthe commencement date.\n\n\f(3)\n\nFor the purposes of subsection (1)(a)(iii)\n\n155\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nregard is to be had to any mortgage, charge or other kind of security\nthat it is reasonable to assume was or may have been available to the\nrespondent for the purposes of obtaining the property;\n\nit is to be assumed that the respondent obtained the property for a price\nequivalent to its market value;\n\nincome is “lawfully obtained” where it is obtained lawfully under the\nlaws of the country from where the income arises;\n\n“known” sources of the respondent’s income are the sources of income,\nwhether  arising  from  employment,  assets  or  otherwise,  that  are\nreasonably ascertainable from information available at the time of the\nmaking of the application for the order.\n\n(4)\n\nIn subsection (1)(b), “politically exposed person” means\n\n(a)\n\nan individual who is, or has been entrusted with a prominent public\nfunction  within  Barbados  or  by  an  international  organisation  or  a\ncountry other than Barbados;\n\n(b)\n\na family member of a person referred to in paragraph (a);\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\na  person  known  to  be  a  close  associate  of  a  person  referred  to  in\nparagraph (a);\n\na person otherwise connected with a person referred to in paragraph\n(a).\n\nWhere  the  property  in  respect  of  which  an  unexplained  wealth  order  is\n(5)\nsought comprises more than one item of property, the reference in subsection (1)\n(a)(ii) to the value of the property is to the total value of those items.\n\nEffect of unexplained wealth order in cases of non-compliance\n\n137.(1)\nWhere the respondent fails, without reasonable excuse, to comply with\nthe  requirements  imposed  by  an  unexplained  wealth  order  in  respect  of  any\n\n\f156\n\nproperty before the end of the response period, the property shall be presumed\nto be recoverable property for the purposes of any proceedings taken in respect\nof the property under Part III, unless the contrary is shown.\n\n(2)\n\nThe presumption in subsection (1) applies in relation to property\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nonly so far as relating to the respondent’s interest in the property; and\n\nonly where the value of that interest is more than such amount as may\nbe prescribed under section 136(1)(a)(ii).\n\nIt is for the court hearing the proceedings under Part III in relation to which\n(3)\nreliance  is  placed  on  the  presumption  to  determine  the  matters  in  subsection\n(2).\n\nThe  “response  period”  is  such  period  as  the  judge  may  specify  under\n(4)\nsection 135(4) as the period within which the requirements imposed by the order\nare to be complied with, or the period ending the latest, where more than one is\nspecified in respect of different requirements.\n\n(5)\n\nFor the purposes of subsection (1)\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nsubject to section 138, a respondent who purports to comply with the\nrequirements imposed by an unexplained wealth order is not to be taken\nto have failed to comply with the order;\n\nwhere an unexplained wealth order imposes more than one requirement\non a respondent, the respondent shall be taken to have failed to comply\nwith  the  requirements  imposed  by  the  order  unless  each  of  the\nrequirements is complied with or is purported to be complied with.\n\nWhere  an  unexplained  wealth  order  is  made  in  respect  of  property\n(6)\ncomprising more than one item of property, the reference in subsection (2)(b) to\nthe value of the respondent’s interest in the property is to the total value of the\nrespondent’s interest in those items.\n\n\f157\n\nEffect of unexplained wealth order in cases of compliance or\npurported compliance\n\n138.(1)\nThis section applies where, before the end of the response period (as\ndefined by section 137(4)), the respondent complies, or purports to comply, with\nthe  requirements  imposed  by  an  unexplained  wealth  order  in  respect  of  any\nproperty in relation to which the order is made.\n\nWhere a freezing order made under section 139 has effect in relation to the\n(2)\nproperty,  the  Recovery  Authority  shall  determine  what  enforcement  or\ninvestigatory proceedings, if any, it considers ought to be taken in relation to the\nproperty.\n\nA determination under subsection (2) shall be made within the period of\n\n(3)\n60 days starting with the date of compliance.\n\nWhere  the  determination  under  subsection  (2)  is  that  no  further\n(4)\nenforcement  or  investigatory  proceedings  ought  to  be  taken  in  relation  to  the\nproperty, the Recovery Authority shall notify the court of that fact as soon as\nreasonably practicable, and in any event, before the end of the period of 60 days\nmentioned in subsection (3).\n\nWhere no freezing order is in effect in relation to the property, the Recovery\n(5)\nAuthority may, at any time, determine what, if any, enforcement or investigatory\nproceedings it considers ought to be taken in relation to the property.\n\nA  determination  under  this  section  to  take  no  further  enforcement  or\n(6)\ninvestigatory  proceedings  in  relation  to  any  property  does  not  prevent  such\nproceedings being taken subsequently, whether as a result of new information or\notherwise, in relation to the property.\n\n(7)\n\nFor the purposes of this section\n\n(a)\n\nthe  respondent  complies  with  the  requirements  imposed  by  an\nunexplained wealth order only if all of the requirements are complied\nwith;\n\n\f158\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nreferences  to  the  date  of  compliance  are  to  the  day  on  which  the\nrequirements imposed by the order are complied with, or, where the\nrequirements are complied with over more than one day, the last of\nthose days; and\n\nwhere an order requires the sending of information in writing to, or the\nproduction  of  documents  at,  an  address  specified  in  the  order,\ncompliance with the order, so far as it relates to that requirement, occurs\nwhen  the  written  information  is  received,  or  the  documents  are\nproduced, at that address,\n\nand  in  paragraphs  (a)  to  (c)  references  to  compliance  include  purported\ncompliance.\n\nIn  this  section  “enforcement  or  investigatory  proceedings”  means  any\n\n(8)\nproceedings in relation to property taken under this Part or Part II or III.\n\nFreezing orders and receivers in relation to unexplained wealth orders\n\nWhere a judge makes an unexplained wealth order in respect of any\n139.(1)\nproperty and the judge considers it necessary to do so for the purpose of avoiding\nthe  risk  of  any  recovery  order  that  might  subsequently  be  obtained  being\nfrustrated, the judge may, on the application of the Recovery Authority, by order\nprohibit the respondent to the unexplained wealth order, and any other person\nwith an interest in the property, from in any way dealing with the property.\n\n(2)\n\nAn application for a freezing order referred to in subsection (1)\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nshall  be  made  in  the  same  proceedings  as  those  in  which  the\nunexplained wealth order is made;\n\nmay be combined in one document with the unexplained wealth order;\nand\n\nshall be made without notice where the application for the unexplained\nwealth order is made without notice.\n\n\f(3)\n\nThe court\n\n159\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nmay  at  any  time  vary  or  discharge  a  freezing  order  made  under\nsubsection (1); and\n\nshall discharge a freezing order, so far as it has effect in relation to any\nproperty, in each of the following 3 cases:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\nthe first case is where the applicable 72 hour period has ended\nand a relevant application has not been made before the end of\nthat period in relation to the property concerned;\n\nthe second case is where a relevant application has been made\nbefore the end of the applicable 72 hour period in relation to the\nproperty concerned and proceedings on the application, including\nany on appeal, have been determined or otherwise disposed of;\nand\n\n(iii)\n\nthe third case is where the court has received a notification in\nrelation to the property concerned under section 138(4).\n\n(4)\n\nFor the purpose of subsection (3), “applicable 72 hour period” means\n\n(a)\n\nwhere  the  respondent  complies,  or  purports  to  comply,  with  the\nrequirements imposed by an unexplained wealth order before the end\nof the response period, the period of 72 hours beginning with the day\nafter  the  day  on  which  the  period  of  60  days  mentioned  in  section\n138(3) ends;\n\n(b)\n\nin any other case, the period of 72 hours beginning with the day after\nthe day on which the response period ends.\n\n(5)\nSection 138(7) applies for the purposes of subsection (4) in determining\nwhether a person complies, or purports to comply, with the requirements imposed\nby  an  unexplained  wealth  order  and  when  such  compliance,  or  purported\ncompliance, takes place.\n\nThe  court  shall,  before  exercising  power  under  this  section  to  vary  or\n(6)\ndischarge a freezing order, as well as giving the parties to the proceedings an\n\n\f160\n\nopportunity to be heard, give such an opportunity to any person who may be\naffected by its decision.\n\nSubsection  (6)  does  not  apply  where  the  court  is  acting  as  required  by\n\n(7)\nsubsection (3)(b).\n\n(8)\n\nIn this section\n\n“relevant application” means an application for a restraint order, a freezing order\n\nmade under section 83(1) or the appointment of a receiver;\n\n“response period” has the meaning specified in section 137(4).\n\nSections 85, 86, 87, 88, 89 and 90 apply in respect of a freezing order made\n(9)\nunder subsection (1) and the appointment of a receiver in relation thereto, subject\nto the modification set out in subsection (10) and such other modifications as\nmay be necessary, as those sections apply with respect to a freezing order made\nunder section 83(1) and the appointment of a receiver under section 87 in relation\nto that order.\n\nThe  modification  referred  to  in  subsection  (9)  is  that  section  87(3)(a)\n(10)\napplies for the purpose of this section as if the reference, in section 87(3)(a), to\nsubsection (4) were to subsection (4)(d) of that section.\n\nDivision 3\n\nDisclosure Orders, Customer Information Orders and Account Monitoring\nOrders\n\nDisclosure orders\n\n140.(1)\nA judge in Chambers may, on the application of a senior police officer,\nwhere he is satisfied that each of the requirements set out in subsection (3) is\nfulfilled, make an order authorising the officer to give to any person the officer\nconsiders has relevant information, notice in writing requiring the person, with\n\n\f161\n\nrespect to any matter relevant to the investigation for the purposes of which the\norder is sought, to\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nanswer any question, either at a time specified in the notice or at once,\nat a place so specified;\n\nprovide  any  information  specified  in  the  notice,  by  a  time  and  in  a\nmanner so specified;\n\nproduce any document, or any documents of a description, specified\nin the notice, either at or by a time so specified or at once, and in a\nmanner so specified.\n\nAn application for a disclosure order shall be made without notice and shall\n\n(2)\nstate that\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\na person specified in the application is subject to a criminal recovery\ninvestigation  or  a  money  laundering  investigation  and  the  order  is\nsought for the purposes of the investigation; or\n\na  person  specified  in  the  application  or  property  specified  in  the\napplication is subject to a civil recovery investigation and the order is\nsought for the purposes of the investigation.\n\nThe requirements referred to in subsection (1) are that there are reasonable\n\n(3)\ngrounds for suspecting\n\n(a)\n\nin the case of\n\n(i)\n\na criminal recovery investigation, that the person specified in the\napplication  has  benefited  from  his  criminal  conduct  or  that\nproperty  specified  in  the  application  as  being  subject  to  the\ninvestigation is an instrumentality of an offence;\n\n(ii)\n\na civil recovery investigation, that\n\n(A)\n\nthe person specified in the application as being subject to the\ninvestigation  holds  recoverable  property  or  associated\n\n\f162\n\nproperty  or  has,  at  any  time,  held  property  that  was\nrecoverable property or associated property at the time; or\n\n(B)\n\nthe

for sufficient consideration or not in favour\nof a person who acted in good faith and without notice, the prosecutor or the\nRecovery Authority, as the case may be, may apply to the Court for an

maximum  period  set  out  opposite  that  amount  in  the  second\ncolumn.\n\n(3)\n\nWhere\n\n(a)\n\na  warrant  of  commitment  is  issued  for  a  default  in  payment  of  an\namount ordered to be paid under this Act in respect of any offence or\noffences; and\n\n(b)\n\nat the time the warrant is issued, the defendant is liable to serve a term\nof custody in respect of the offence or offences,\n\nthe term of imprisonment to be served in default of payment of the amount shall\nnot begin to run until after the term mentioned in paragraph (b) has been served.\n\nWhere, under a power granted by this Act, the Court varies a confiscation\n(4)\norder  or  a  recovery  order  and  the  effect  is  to  reduce  the  maximum  period  of\nimprisonment specified in this section\n\n(a)\n\nwhere, as a result, the maximum period of imprisonment is less than\nthe term of imprisonment imposed by the Court, the Court shall impose\na reduced term of imprisonment;
