of\ncompetent jurisdiction, sell the ship or share without the concurrence of every\nprior mortgagee.\n\nMortgage not affected by bankruptcy\n\n257.\nA registered mortgage of a ship or share shall not be affected by any\nact of bankruptcy committed by the mortgagor after the date of the registration\nof the mortgage, notwithstanding that the mortgagor at the commencement of the\nbankruptcy had the ship or share in his possession, order or disposition, or was\nthe reputed owner of it, and the mortgage shall be preferred to any right, claim,\nor interest in the ship or share of the other creditors of the bankrupt or of any\ntrustee or assignee on their behalf.\n\nTransfer of mortgages and transmission of mortgage interest\n\n258.(1)\nA registered mortgage of a ship or share may be

person\nentitled under the transmission in the register as mortgagee of the ship or share.\n\nLien of registered mortgage\n\nA  mortgage  validly  registered  under  this  Act  shall  constitute  a\n259.(1)\nmaritime  lien  upon  the  vessel  in  the  amount  of  the  outstanding  mortgage\nindebtedness secured by the vessel.\n\nA mortgagor, before executing a registered mortgage, shall disclose to the\n(2)\nmortgagee in writing the existence of every maritime lien, prior mortgage or other\nobligation  or  liability  upon  the  vessel  to  be  mortgaged  that  is  known  to  the\nmortgagor.\n\nAfter the execution of the mortgage and before the mortgagee has had a\n(3)\nreasonable time in which to record it and have proper endorsements made upon\nthe documents of the vessel, the mortgagor shall not, without the consent of the\nmortgagee, incur any contractual obligation creating a maritime lien upon the\nvessel other than liens denominated in Article 4 of the International Convention\non Maritime Liens and Mortgages, 1993.\n\nA preferred mortgage may bear the rate of interest that the parties to the\n\n(4)\nmortgage mutually agree.\n\n\f284\n\nRecord of

Registrar for recording purposes.\n\nJurisdiction and procedure on mortgages\n\n261.(1)\nNotwithstanding section 260, a lien in respect of a mortgage may be\nenforced in Barbados by a suit in rem in the High Court upon default of any of\nits terms or conditions and, in addition to any notice by publication, the applicant\nshall give notice of the commencement of suit, in such a manner as the High\nCourt may direct, to the master, other ranking officer or caretaker of the vessel\nand to any person who has recorded a notice of claim of an undischarged lien\nupon the vessel.\n\n\f285\n\n(2)\nSubsection (1) does not apply where, in spite of a bona fide attempt made\nby the applicant to the satisfaction of the High Court, the person could not be\ntraced within Barbados.\n\n(3)\nSubject to section 251, the lien of a mortgage may also be enforced by a\nsuit in rem or otherwise in any foreign country in which the vessel may be found,\nin  accordance  with  the  procedure  of  that  country  for  the  enforcement  of  ship\nmortgages constituting maritime liens on vessels documented under the laws of\nthat country.\n\nNotwithstanding anything in this Act, a mortgagee may, in addition to any\n(4)\nother remedies granted under this section, bring a suit in personam against the\nmortgagor in a court of competent jurisdiction for the amount of the outstanding\nmortgage indebtedness or for any deficiency in the full payment of it.\n\nNothing  in  this  Act  is  deemed  to  authorize  the  enforcement  by  suit  in\n(5)\nrem  in  the  High  Court  of  the  rights  of  the  mortgagee  in  respect  of  assets  or\npersonal property other than vessels covered by a mortgage.\n\nConsequences of sale by the court\n\n262.\nThe sale of a vessel may be

owner  or  of  any  person  authorized  by  the  owner,  have  a\nmaritime lien on the vessel from the time of the transaction for the amounts due\nin that respect.\n\nMarine  liens  created  pursuant  to  this  section  shall  be  governed  by  the\n\n(2)\ninternational conventions referred to in section 264.\n\n\f286\n\n(3)\nNothing in this section is deemed to confer a lien in favour of a person\nreferred to in subsection (1) if the person knew, or with the exercise of reasonable\ndiligence could have ascertained, that the person who requisitioned the services,\nsupplies or other necessaries was acting without authority.\n\nA person who is entitled to a lien under subsection (1) may, at any time by\n(4)\nagreement or otherwise, waive his right to the lien or, in the case of preferred\nmortgage, to the preferred status of the lien.\n\nInternational Convention on Maritime Liens and Mortgages, 1993\n\nArticle  16  of  the  International  Convention  on  Maritime  Liens  and\n264.(1)\nMortgages, 1993 shall have the force of law in Barbados, but without prejudice\nto any transaction enacted prior to the date of coming into force of this Act to\nwhich Article 1-11 of

lien  that  may  be\nclaimed against a vessel and that take precedence over all other liens on the vessel,\nother  than  liens  specified  under  Article  4  of  the  International  Convention  on\nMaritime Liens and Mortgages 1993.\n\nMeaning of preferred mortgage\n\n266.\na vessel registered in Barbados that meets the requirements of section 269.\n\nIn this Part, “preferred mortgage” means a mortgage recorded against\n\n\f287\n\nRecording and contents\n\n267.(1)\nA  sale,  conveyance,  hypothecation,  mortgage  or  assignment  of\nmortgage of a vessel, against a person other than the grantor or mortgagor, his\nheirs  or  devises  and  persons  having  actual  notice  of  it  is  not  valid  until  the\ninstrument evidencing the transaction is recorded under this section.\n\nThe Principal Registrar shall record an instrument referred to in subsection\n(2)\n(1),  in  the  order  of  its  receipt,  in  the  indices  to  be  kept  for  that  purpose,\nshowing\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nthe name of the vessel;\n\nthe names of the parties;\n\nthe time and date of receipt of the instrument;\n\n(d)\n\nthe interest of the vessel transferred or affected; and\n\n(e)\n\nthe  amount  of  the  direct  or  contingent  obligations,  including  those\nprovided for in section 275, that are or may become secured by the\nmortgage.\n\nRegistration, recording and discharge of financing charters\n\n268.(1)\nWithout  adversely  affecting  the  documentation,  eligibility  for\ndocumentation or renewal of documentation of a vessel, a documented owner\nand a charterer who has executed a contract in the form of a demise or bareboat\ncharter of a documented vessel may register for recording a copy of the contract\nwith the Principal Registrar in the name of the documented owner.\n\nThe contract shall be signed and acknowledged by the documented owner\n\n(2)\nand the charterer and shall include\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nthe name and official number of the vessel;\n\nthe date of the contract;\n\nthe names and addresses of the documented owner and the charterer;\n\n\f288\n\n(d)\n\nthe total amount secured; and\n\n(e)\n\nthe  maximum  aggregate  of  the  nominal  amount  of  all  charter  hire\npayments, termination payments, and purchase or put option amounts\nthat  could  under  any  circumstances  be  due  and  payable  under  the\nfinancing  charter,  excluding  any  interest,  indemnities,  expenses  or\nfees.\n\nA security interest in a vessel in favour of a documented owner, evidenced\n(3)\nby  a  contract  that  is  a  financing  charter,  that  is  registered  for  recording  in\ncompliance with this section, is deemed to be a preferred mortgage on the vessel\nin favour of the documented owner for all purposes, effective as of the date and\ntime of filing.\n\nThis  Part  shall  apply  to  any  contract  registered  in  accordance  with  this\n\n(4)\nsection that is a financing charter.\n\nA  documented  owner  may  also  register  for  recording,  any  renewals,\n(5)\namendments, supplements, assignments or other instruments related to a contract\nregistered under subsection (1).\n\nA  documented  owner  may  grant  one  or  more  preferred  mortgages\n(6)\nencumbering  the  whole  of  a  vessel,  and  any  supplements,  amendments,\nassignments  or  other  instruments  related  to  them,  notwithstanding  that  the\ndocumented owner or predecessor in interest has entered into a contract that is\ndeemed to be a preferred mortgage on the vessel pursuant to subsection (1).\n\nThe mere registration or recording of a contract as a financing charter under\n(7)\nthis section shall not constitute evidence that the contract is, in fact, a financing\ncharter or that it creates a security interest.\n\nThe  documented  owner  party  to  a  financing  charter  is  deemed  to  be  a\n(8)\nmortgagee under a preferred mortgage and the finance charterer is deemed the\nmortgagor, for all purposes under the laws of Barbados.\n\nWithout  affecting  the  validity  of  a  financing  charter  as  a  preferred\n(9)\nmortgage, the parties to a financing charter may redact or omit any exhibit to it,\nincluding any schedule with respect to the due date and amount of individual\n\n\f289\n\ninstalments  of  charter  hire  and  the  timing  and  amount  of  individual  purchase\noptions, termination payments or puts.\n\nAn existing demise or bareboat charter that does not meet the requirements\n(10)\nof this section may be eligible for filing as a financing charter upon execution\nand acknowledgment of an amendment or supplement that specifically attaches\nand incorporates the existing demise or bareboat charter, if the amendment or\nsupplement meets the recording requirements of this section.\n\nThe Principal Registrar may accept for filing a discharge of a preferred\n(11)\nmortgage maritime lien that is evidenced by a recorded financing charter under\nthis section, if the filing will not affect the registration of the vessel or otherwise\naffect any rights or obligations of the parties under the financing charter.\n\nPreferred mortgage\n\nA valid mortgage that at the time it is made includes the whole of a\n269.(1)\nvessel,  including  a  vessel  under  construction,  shall  have  a  preferred  status  in\nrespect of the vessel as of the date of its recording under this Act.\n\nThe preferred status of a mortgage under this Part shall not be prejudiced\n\n(2)\nor impaired by reason\n\n(a)\n\nthat the mortgage secures the payment, pledge or assignment of monies\nor  rights,  due  or  to  become  due,  such  as  guarantee  fees,  insurance\noptions,  charter  hire,  freight  revenues  or  any  other  fees,  costs  or\ncharges,  direct  or  contingent,  incidental  to  the  sale,  purchase  or\noperation of a Barbados vessel;\n\n(b)\n\nof the applicability of or compliance with section 275; or\n\n(c)\n\nthat  no  advance  of  monies  is  or  has  been  made  at  the  time  of  its\nrecording.\n\n(3)\n\nNotwithstanding subsection (1), a valid mortgage, whenever made, that\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nincludes the whole of any vessel;\n\nis recorded as provided in this Part; and\n\n\f290\n\n(c)\n\nis granted in continuation of a prior recorded mortgage, hypothecation\nor  similar  charge  on  the  vessel,  whether  granted  under  the  laws  of\nBarbados  or  the  laws  of  another  nation  under  which  the  vessel  was\ndocumented at the time the prior mortgage was recorded,\n\nshall have preferred status in respect of the vessel as of the date of recording of\nthe prior mortgage, hypothecation or similar charge.\n\nFor purposes of this section, a mortgage that is granted in continuation of\n(4)\na prior recorded mortgage, hypothecation or similar charge is deemed a mortgage\non a Barbados vessel if\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nthe vessel covered by the mortgage is covered by the prior mortgage,\nhypothecation or similar charge;\n\nthe obligations secured by the mortgage are obligations secured by the\nprior mortgage, hypothecation or similar charge;\n\nthe mortgage is granted by the current vessel owner, whether or not the\nowner  is  the  vessel  owner  who  granted  the  prior  mortgage,\nhypothecation or similar charge to secure obligations secured by the\nprior mortgage, hypothecation or similar charge; and\n\n(d)\n\nfor  a  vessel  entering  the  Barbados  international  ships  registry,  the\nmortgage is recorded during the period defined in subsection (6).\n\nNothing  in  subsection  (4)  shall  be  construed  to  pre-empt  any  court\n(5)\njudgment that would recognize the preferred status of a mortgage on a vessel of\nBarbados prior to the date of its recording.\n\nFor  a  vessel  entering  the  Barbados  international  ships  registry,  the\n(6)\npreferred  status  of  a  mortgage,  hypothecation  or  similar  charge  on  the  vessel\nrecognized under section 284 shall continue for a period of 30 days following\nregistration of the vessel, if the information with respect to the mortgage required\nby the Principal Registrar is furnished to the Principal Registrar in connection\nwith the registration of the vessel under this Act.\n\n\f291\n\n(7)\nThe preferred status of a mortgage shall not be adversely affected by the\ndeletion or release of the mortgage as a matter of record from the vessel’s prior\nregister in connection with, or as a condition to, deletion of the vessel from that\nregister.\n\nA certified extract of the preferred mortgage index of the public register\n(8)\nmaintained  by  the  Principal  Registrar,  a  certificate  of  ownership  and\nencumbrance  issued  by  the  Principal  Registrar  or,  in  the  case  of  a  mortgage,\nhypothecation  or  similar  charge  recorded\nin  another  nation,  similar\ndocumentation,  including  a  transcript  of  registry,  certified  or  issued  by  the\nappropriate governmental agency in that nation, shall be accepted as evidence of\nthe  granting  and  recording  of  a  mortgage,  hypothecation  or  similar  charge,\nincluding the date of its recording.\n\nTermination of mortgagee’s interest\n\nThe interest of a mortgagee in a vessel registered under this Act shall\n270.(1)\nnot  be  terminated  by  a  forfeiture  of  the  vessel  for  a  violation  of  any  law  of\nBarbados, unless the mortgagee authorized, consented or conspired to effect the\nact, failure, or omission that constituted the violation.\n\nSubject to subsection (3), a vessel that is the subject of a preferred mortgage\n(2)\nmay not be cancelled from the register for so long as the indebtedness secured\nby the preferred mortgage remains unsatisfied or the mortgage is not otherwise\ndischarged.\n\nThe Principal Registrar may, not less than 60 days following the mailing\n(3)\nof notice to all mortgagees of record at their last known mailing addresses of his\nintent to do so, strike a vessel from the registry and flag of Barbados as a result\nof receipt by the Principal Registrar of evidence satisfactory to him that the vessel\nhas been lost, destroyed or transferred to another registry following sale by order\nof an admiralty court in a civil action in rem.\n\nThe striking of a vessel under subsection (3) shall not impair or affect the\n(4)\nlien or status of any preferred mortgage recorded under this Part or terminate the\ninterest of a mortgagee in the vessel.\n\n\f292\n\nConditions precedent for ship mortgage\n\n271.(1)\nstates the interest of the mortgagor in the vessel, and the interest mortgaged.\n\nA mortgage in relation to a vessel shall not be recordable unless it\n\n(2)\nA mortgage or instrument of release or discharge of a mortgage shall not\nbe recorded unless it is notarized, bears an apostille, has been acknowledged or\nis  submitted  with  such  other  proof  of  due  execution  required  by  the  laws  of\nBarbados.\n\nBill of sale; recording\n\n272.\nconveyance of a vessel, or a facsimile of one, if\n\nThe Principal Registrar may accept for recording a bill of sale or other\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nthe original has been received by a notary public or a special agent that\nrecites the interest of the seller in the vessel and the interests sold or\nconveyed;\n\nit has previously been acknowledged or is submitted with such other\nproof of due execution required by the laws of Barbados; and\n\nif it is a bill of sale of a vessel already documented under the laws of\nBarbados,  it  has  attached  to  it  a  copy  of  its  latest  certificate  of\nregistration.\n\nRecording of mortgage\n\n273.(1)\nvessel if\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nThe  Principal  Registrar  may  accept  for  recording  a  mortgage  on  a\n\nit recites the interest of the mortgagor in the vessel and the interest\nmortgaged;\n\nit  is  notarized,  bears  an  apostille,  has  been  acknowledged  or  is\nsubmitted with such other proof of due execution required by the laws\nof Barbados; and\n\n\f293\n\n(c)\n\nwritten proof is furnished to the Principal Registrar of the amounts and\ndates of any documents or evidence of debts in support of it.\n\n(2)\nThe  Principal  Registrar  shall  record  a  mortgage  or  related  instrument\nsubmitted in proper form, and shall, upon request, issue a certified extract of the\npreferred  mortgage  index  of  the  public  register  maintained  by  the  Principal\nRegistrar as evidence of recording of a preferred ship mortgage under this Part.\n\nA certificate of ownership and encumbrance shall, upon request, be issued\n(3)\nby the Principal Registrar, setting forth all recorded mortgages, encumbrances\nand related instruments with respect to a vessel registered under this Act as at the\ntime and date of its issuance.\n\nAllocation of mortgage indebtedness\n\nIf  a  preferred  mortgage  includes  more  than  one  vessel  or  includes\n274.(1)\nproperty that is not a vessel, the mortgage may provide for the separate discharge\nof each vessel and of all property not a vessel by the payment of a part of the\nmortgage indebtedness.\n\nIf a vessel that is covered by a preferred mortgage includes more than one\n(2)\nvessel, or property that is not a vessel, is to be sold on the order of an admiralty\ncourt in a civil action in rem and the mortgage does not provide for a separate\ndischarge as provided in subsection (2), the preferred mortgage shall constitute\na lien on that vessel in the full amount of the outstanding mortgage indebtedness,\nand  an  allocation  of  mortgage  indebtedness  for  the  purpose  of  a  separate\ndischarge may not be made by that court among the vessel and other property\ncovered by the mortgage.\n\nAdvances and repayments pursuant to commitment\n\nA  preferred  mortgage  may  secure  future  advances,  including\n275.(1)\ncontingent obligations, and shall not be extinguished or lose its priority because\nall  previously  outstanding  obligations  secured  by  it  have  been  fully  repaid  or\notherwise performed, if an advance or other value is to be given at a later time\npursuant to commitment existing at the time the mortgage is recorded.\n\n\f294\n\n(2)\nFor  the  purpose  of  subsection  (1),  an  advance  or  other  value  is  given\npursuant to commitment if the mortgagee or other person entitled to the benefit\nof the security of the mortgage has bound himself to give it, whether or not a\nsubsequent event of default or other event not within his control has relieved, or\nmay relieve, him from that obligation.\n\nWhen a preferred mortgage secures an obligation in respect of which one\n(3)\nor more advances or repayments may be made from time to time in the future\nand the maximum amount outstanding under the obligation at any one time is\nlimited  to  a  certain  amount,  the  amount  to  be  recorded  with  respect  to  that\nobligation may be either\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe maximum amount that may be outstanding at any one time; or\n\nthe aggregate of all possible advances that may be made.\n\nA preferred mortgage made pursuant to commitment shall clearly indicate\n(4)\nwhether the amount is the maximum amount that may be outstanding at any one\ntime or is the aggregate of all possible advances.\n\nAdvances or other value given pursuant to agreement\n\n276.(1)\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this Part, a preferred mortgage\nmay  secure  an  agreed-upon  maximum  amount  representing  all  debts  or\nobligations arising or that may arise between the debtor and the creditor within\na specified period.\n\nSuch a maximum amount may exceed the value of the vessel or vessels,\n(2)\nwhich may themselves represent only a part of all of the assets that are subject\nto the preferred mortgage.\n\nOnly indebtedness that incurred on or prior to the maturity date or date of\n(3)\ntermination of a preferred mortgage made pursuant to agreement shall retain its\nstatus  and  ranking  as  a  preferred  maritime  lien  under  this  Part,  and  that\nindebtedness  shall  include  all  expenses  and  interest  associated  with  the\nindebtedness prior to maturity.\n\n\f295\n\n(4)\nA preferred mortgage made pursuant to agreement under this section shall\nnot be required to represent a commitment to lend on the part of the mortgagee,\nbut shall secure all debts or obligations arising or that may arise between the\nparties as a result of transactions the nature of which are subject to the provisions\nof the mortgage deed, whether present or future, actual or contingent, and shall\nset forth in addition to other terms and conditions the maximum amount and the\nmaturity  date,  or  a  statement  of  the  date  of  termination  if  it  is  other  than  the\nmaturity date.\n\nNothing  contained  in  this  section  shall  be  construed  to  impair  the  lien\n(5)\nstatus, recordability, validity or enforceability with respect to a vessel registered\nunder this Part of a preferred mortgage granted by its owner that\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nsecures  obligations,  in  whole  or  in  part,  arising  out  of  specific\nsuccessive business contracts or other transactions, whether or not such\ncontracts or transactions are related to or arise from the construction,\npurchase, sale or chartering of a vessel registered under this Part; or\n\nsecures all debts or obligations owed or to be owed under it, so long as\nthe aggregate amount of such debts or obligations does not exceed at\nany one time the stated maximum amount of the mortgage.\n\nThe  preferred  status  of  a  mortgage  made  pursuant  to  agreement  in\n(6)\naccordance with this section that may be secured by property that is not a vessel\nor more than one vessel shall not be impaired by reason that the mortgage does\nnot provide for a separate discharge of it.\n\nUnits of account\n\n277.(1)\nThe obligations secured by a preferred mortgage may be expressed in\nany unit or units of account to which the parties may agree, including the currency\nof Barbados and the currency of a foreign state, or in equivalents of any other\nunit or units of account established by intergovernmental organizations.\n\nIf a preferred mortgage secures an obligation in one or more specified units\n(2)\nof account and there is an option to have a unit of account altered from time to\n\n\f296\n\ntime, the principal amount of the mortgage to be recorded shall be denominated\nin one or more of the specified units of account.\n\nA recording referred to in subsection (2) may include as additional words\n(3)\n“or an equivalent amount in any alternate unit of account” or similar language,\nand if such additional words are recorded, no change in the recorded amount shall\nbe required to reflect the fact that the obligation or any portion of it is subsequently\ndenominated in a different unit of account, unless the parties otherwise agree.\n\nWhen a preferred mortgage secures an obligation in respect of which there\n(4)\nis an option to have the obligation amount denominated from time to time in\nalternate units of account but which continues to be payable in, or by reference\nto, a specified unit of account\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe amount of the obligation to be recorded shall be expressed in the\nspecified unit of account; and\n\nnotwithstanding any exercise of the option, no change in the recorded\namount shall be required.\n\nA preferred mortgage described in subsections (2) or (4) may additionally\n(5)\nsecure  a  loss  up  to  a  specified  amount  arising  out  of  fluctuations  between  a\nspecified unit of account and any alternate unit of account in which the obligation\namount may be denominated from time to time, and that specified amount shall\nalso be recorded.\n\nLien of preferred mortgage\n\n278.(1)\nA  preferred  mortgage  shall  constitute  a  maritime  lien  upon  the\nmortgaged  vessel  in  the  amount  of  the  outstanding  mortgage  indebtedness\nsecured by the vessel.\n\nThe  lien  of  a  preferred  mortgage  shall  not  be  in  any  way  impaired  or\n(2)\naffected because the vessel’s document following recording of the mortgage has\nexpired, or has been restrictively endorsed, suspended, revoked or cancelled.\n\n\f297\n\nInterest on preferred mortgage\n\nNotwithstanding  any  other  law  or  regulation  to  the  contrary,  a\n279.\npreferred mortgage may secure an interest, including interest in an interest, on\nan obligation secured by the mortgage as the parties may agree, including at a\nfixed rate, variable rate, rate based upon a formula, or by adding margins to the\nmortgagee’s  cost,  from  time  to  time,  of  funding  an  obligation  secured  by  the\nmortgage.\n\nPriority, disclosure of liens and penalty\n\nA mortgagor, before executing a preferred mortgage, shall disclose to\n280.(1)\nthe mortgagee in writing the existence of any maritime lien, prior mortgage or\nother obligation or liability upon the vessel to be mortgaged that is known as the\nmortgagor.\n\nAfter  the  execution  of  a  mortgage  and  before  the  mortgagee  has  had  a\n(2)\nreasonable time in which to record it, the mortgagor shall not incur without the\nconsent  of  the  mortgagee  any  contractual  obligation  creating  a  lien  upon  the\nvessel, other than a lien specified under Article 4 of the Convention on Maritime\nLiens and Mortgages 1993.\n\nA mortgagor, or the president or

453  to  456,  a  ship  is  unsafe  if,  having\n452.(1)\nregard to the nature of the service for which she is intended, the ship is unfit to\ngo to sea without serious danger to human life by reason of\n\n(a)\n\nthe condition, or the unsuitability for its purpose, of\n\n(i)\n\nthe ship or her machinery or equipment; or\n\n(ii)\n\nany part of the ship or its machinery or equipment;\n\n(b)\n\nundermanning;\n\n(c)\n\noverloading or unsafe or improper loading; or\n\n(d)\n\nany other matter relevant to the safety of the ship.\n\nFor the purposes of sections 453 to 456, a ship at sea is unsafe if, having\n(2)\nregard to the nature of the service for which she is being used or is intended, the\nship is, by reason of the matters referred to in paragraphs (1)(a) to (d),\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nunfit to remain at sea without serious danger to human life; or\n\nunfit to go on a voyage without serious danger to human life.\n\nIn sections 420 to 423, a reference to “going to sea” shall, in a case where\n(3)\nthe  service  for  which  the  ship  is  intended  consists  of  going  on  voyages  or\nexcursions that do not involve going to sea, be construed as a reference to going\non such a voyage or excursion.\n\nPower to detain unsafe ship\n\n453.(1)\nto an inspector to be an unsafe ship, the ship may be detained.\n\nWhere a ship in a port in Barbados or at sea in Barbados waters appears\n\n\f403\n\nSubject to subsection (3), the power of detention conferred by subsection\n\n(2)\n(1) is exercisable in relation to foreign ships as well as Barbados ships.\n\n(3)\nThe power of detention of a ship at sea in Barbados waters is not exercisable\nin relation to a foreign-registered ship while the ship is exercising the right of\ninnocent passage.\n\nThe officer detaining a ship shall serve on the master of the ship a detention\n\n(4)\nnotice that\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nstates that the inspector is of the opinion that the ship is an unsafe ship;\n\nspecifies the matters that, in the inspector’s opinion, make the ship an\nunsafe ship; and\n\nrequires  the  ship  to  comply  with  the  terms  of  the  notice  until  it  is\nreleased by an officer referred to in section 1220(1).\n\nAn officer detaining a ship that is not a Barbados ship shall send a copy of\n(5)\nthe detention notice as soon as practicable to the nearest consular officer for the\ncountry to which the ship belongs.\n\n(6)\n\nIn this section, “ inspector” means a person referred to in section 1056(1).\n\nReferral of detention notice to arbitration\n\n454.(1)\nWithin 21 days from the service of a detention notice under section\n453(4)(b), the master or owner of a ship may, by a notice given to the inspector,\nrefer any question as to whether an opinion formed by an inspector on a matter\nspecified in the detention notice had a valid basis to a single arbitrator appointed\nby agreement between the parties to the arbitration agreement.\n\nThe giving of a notice in accordance with subsection (1) shall not suspend\n(2)\nthe  operation  of  the  detention  notice  unless,  on  the  application  of  the  person\nmaking the referral, the arbitrator so directs.\n\nThe arbitrator shall have regard, in coming to his decision, to any other\n(3)\nmatters not specified in the detention notice that appear to him to be relevant to\nwhether the ship was an unsafe ship.\n\n\f404\n\nWhere on a reference under this section the arbitrator decides, as respects\n\n(4)\nany matter to which the reference relates,\n\n(a)\n\nthat  the  matter  did  not  constitute  a  valid  basis  for  the  inspector’s\nopinion,  he  shall  cancel  the  detention  notice  or  affirm  it  with  such\nmodifications as he may think fit; and\n\n(b)\n\nthat the matter constituted a valid basis for the opinion, he shall affirm\nthe notice in its original form.\n\nThe arbitrator shall include in his decision a finding whether there was a\n\n(5)\nvalid basis for the detention of the ship as an unsafe ship.\n\nA person is not qualified for appointment as an arbitrator under this section\n\n(6)\nunless he is\n\n(a)\n\na person holding a certificate of competency as a master mariner or as\na marine engineer officer class 1, or an equivalent certificate;\n\n(b)\n\na naval architect;\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\na  barrister  or  solicitor  of  10  years  standing  entitled  to  practice  in\nBarbados or in a Commonwealth jurisdiction; or\n\na person with special experience of shipping matters, or of activities\ncarried on in ports.\n\nAn arbitrator appointed under this section shall have the powers conferred\n\n(7)\non an inspector by section 1057.\n\n(8)\n\nIn this section “inspector” means a person referred to in section 1056(1).\n\nCompensation for invalid detention of ship\n\n455.(1)\nrelation to a ship\n\nIf on a reference under section 454 relating to a detention notice in\n\n(a)\n\nthe arbitrator decides that a matter did not constitute a valid basis for\nthe inspector’s opinion; and\n\n\f405\n\n(b)\n\nit appears to him that there were no reasonable grounds for the inspector\nto form that opinion,\n\nthe arbitrator may award the owner of the ship such compensation in respect of\nany  loss  suffered  by  him  in  consequence  of  the  detention  of  the  ship  as  the\narbitrator thinks fit.\n\nAny  compensation  awarded  under  this  section  shall  be  payable  by  the\n\n(2)\nMinister.\n\nOwner and master liable in respect of unsafe ship\n\n456.(1)\n\nIf a ship that\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nis in a port in Barbados; or\n\nis a Barbados ship and is in any other port,\n\nis unsafe, the master and the owner of the ship each commit an offence.\n\nWhere, at the time when a ship is unsafe, any responsibilities of the owner\n(2)\nwith respect to the matters relevant to its safety have been assumed in whole or\nin part by a person other than the owner\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\ndirectly, under the terms of a charter-party or management agreement\nmade with the owner; or\n\nindirectly, under the terms of a series of charter-parties or management\nagreements,\n\nthe reference to the owner in subsection (1) shall be construed as a reference to\nthat other person.\n\n(3)\n\nA person guilty of an offence under this section is liable\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\non summary conviction, to a fine of $100 000; or\n\non conviction on indictment, to a fine of $200 000 or to imprisonment\nfor a term of 2 years, or both.\n\n\f406\n\nIt shall be a defence in proceedings for an offence under this section to\n\n(4)\nprove that, at the time of the alleged offence\n\n(a)\n\narrangements  had  been  made  that  were  appropriate  to  ensure  that\nbefore the ship went to sea it was made fit to do so without any serious\ndanger  to  human  life  by  reason  of  the  matters  relevant  to  its  safety\nspecified in the charge; or\n\n(b)\n\nit was reasonable for such arrangements not to have been made.\n\nIt shall also be a defence in proceedings for an offence under this section\n\n(5)\nto prove that\n\n(a)\n\nunder the terms of a charter-party or management agreement entered\ninto by the accused,\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\nwhere the accused is the owner, his responsibilities with respect\nto the matters relevant to the ship’s safety; or\n\nwhere the accused is liable to proceedings under this section by\nvirtue of subsection (2), the responsibilities assumed by him,\n\nhad at the time of the alleged offence been wholly assumed by some other person\nor persons who were party to the agreement; and\n\n(b)\n\nin the circumstances of the case, the accused had taken reasonable steps\nand exercised reasonable diligence to secure the proper discharge of\nthe relevant responsibilities during the period during which they had\nbeen assumed by the person referred to in paragraph (a).\n\nIn  determining  whether  a  defence  is  available  to  an  accused  under\n\n(6)\nsubsection (5), regard shall be had to\n\n(a)\n\nwhether prior to the time of the alleged offence the accused was, or in\nall  the  circumstances  ought  reasonably  to  have  been,  aware  of  any\ndeficiency  in  the  discharge  of  the  responsibilities  referred  to  in\nsubsection (5); and\n\n\f407\n\n(b)\n\nthe extent to which the accused was or was notable, under the terms of\na charter-party or management agreement referred to in paragraph (5)\n(a),\n\n(i)\n\nto terminate it; or\n\n(ii)\n\nto intervene in the management of the ship,\n\nin the event of any such deficiency, and whether it was reasonable for the accused\nto place himself in that position.\n\nNo proceedings for an offence under this section shall be instituted except\n\n(7)\nby, or with the consent of, the Minister or the Director of Public Prosecutions.\n\nIn this section, “management agreement”, in relation to a ship, means an\n(8)\nagreement,  other  than  a  charter-party  agreement  or  contract  of  employment,\nunder which the ship is managed, in whole or in part, by a person other than the\nowner, whether on behalf of the owner or on behalf of some other person.\n\nReferences in this section to responsibilities being assumed by a person\n(9)\nunder the terms of a charter-party or management agreement are references to\ntheir being so assumed by him whether or not he has entered into a further charter-\nparty or management agreement providing for them to be assumed by some other\nperson.\n\nUse of unsafe vessels\n\n457.(1)\nlighter, barge or like vessel when, because of\n\nWhere a
