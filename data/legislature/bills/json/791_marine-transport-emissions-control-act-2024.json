Dust, dirt, soot, smoke and exhaustparticles are considered PM. PM is typically categorized as totally PM, or just PM, or can be further divided into twosmaller size categories:PM10,which consists ofparticles measuring up to 10 micro-metres in diameter and PM25, which consists ofparticles measuring 2.5 micro-metres in diameter or smaller.Diesel Particulate Matter (DPM) is a species of PMconsidered very important.SOURCESAirborne PM is a mixture of solid particles and liquiddroplets generated innumerous ways. The primaryport-related PM  sources arefrom exhaust of engines thatpower shore-side equipmentand vehicles, marine vessels,non-renewable energy generation and otherindustrial and commercialsources that burn fuel. PM can also be generated fromlarge open  areas of exposedearth earth or dirt roads wherevehicles and equipment candisperse PM into the air.HEALTH ANDENVIRONMENTALEFFECTSFine particles are a concern due to their microscopic size, which enables them to travelmore deeply into the lungs and blood stream, increasing health issues.Exposure to PM2.5 is linked  to respiratory disease,decreased lung function, asthma attacks, heart attacks and premature death.\f159\n\n L.R.O. 1998Eleventh Schedule - (Cont'd)AIR POLLUTANTS - (Cont'd)Oxides of Sulphur (SOx) is agroup of colourless,  corrosivegases, produced by burningfuels containing Sulphur.Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are any compound of carbon other than CO, CO(cid:3671),carbonic acid, metalliccarbides, or carbonates andammonium carbonate whichparticipate in atmosphericphotochemical reactions.Some VOCs are alsoconsidered  PM.SOURCES - (Cont'd)SOx is group of gases released when fuels containing Sulphur are burned in the combustionprocess. The primary port-related SOx sources is exhaust from engines that power shore-side equipment and vehicles,marine vessels, non-renewableenergy generation, other fossil-fuel based industrial andcommercial activities in andaround the port.VOCs are generated when fuel is burned in the combustion process. The primary port-related VOC sources are from the exhaust of engines thatpower shore-side equipment and vehicles, marine vessels,non-renewable energy- generation and other fossil-fuel based commercial andindustrial activities in and around the port.HEALTH ANDENVIRONMENTALEFFECTS - (Cont'd)SOx is associated with avariety   of    respiratory diseases Inhalation of SOxcan cause increased airwayresistance by constrictinglung passages. Some of the SOx become sulphateparticles in theatmosphere, adding tomeasured PM levels.High concentrations ofgaseous SOx can lead to theformation of acid rain,harming trees and plants bydamaging foliage anddecreasing growth.VOCs contribute to ozonedepletion, and some aretoxic and contribute to a widerange of adverse healtheﬀ ects.\f160\n\n L.R.O. 1998Eleventh Schedule - (Concl'd)AIR POLLUTANTS - (Concl'd)Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colourless, odourless toxic gas commonly formed when carbon containing fuel is notcompletely burned.Greenhouse gases (GHGs) that are typically emitted fromport-related sources include carbon dioxide  (CO(cid:3671);),methane (CH4), and nitrousoxide(N20).SOURCES - (Concl'd)CO forms during incomplete combustion of fuels. The primary port-related COsources are from theexhaust from engines that power shore-sideequipment and vehicles, marine vessels, non-renewableenergy generation and otherfossil-fuel based commercialand industrial activities in andaround the port.GHGs come from naturalprocesses and human activities. The primary port-related GHG sources are fromengines that power shore-side equipment and vehicles,marine vessels, non-renewableenergy generation and otherfossil-fuel based commercialand industrial activities in andaround the port.HEALTH ANDENVIRONMENTALEFFECTS - (Concl'd)CO combines withhaemoglobin in red bloodcells and decrease theoxygen-carrying capacityof the blood. CO weakensheart contractions, reducing the amount of blood pumped through the body. It can aﬀ ectbrain and lung function.Most climate scientistagree that the main cause ofthe current global warming trend is the human expansion of the 'greenhouse eﬀ ect'.Warming results when the atmosphere traps heatradiating from Earth towardsSpace. Certain gases in the atmosphere block heat from escaping, otherwise referred to as GHGs.
