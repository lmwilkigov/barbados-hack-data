The system was devised for a different era and has its roots in a\n\ndifferent place.  Nearly 52 years after Independence, it is right that we revisit this issue\n\nand  come  up  with  legislation  that  is  relevant  to  a  21st  Century  Barbados.  Our  current\n\nsystem is neither efficient in its approach nor transparent in its application.  It is seen as\n\na  barrier  to  investment  and  at  the  same  time  lacks  the  teeth  to  protect  our  fragile\n\nenvironment and cultural heritage.\n\nIn  its  2018  Manifesto,  “Building  The  Best  Barbados  Together”,  the  Government\n\ncommitted itself to  improving  the quality and speed of delivery of services,  including\n\nTown  and  Country  Planning  permissions,  to  promote  doing  business  with  ease.    The\n\nreform of this outdated legislation was, therefore, identified as “mission critical”.\n\nIn order to engage the people of Barbados in the development of new legislation, two\n\nstakeholder consultations on the reform of the planning system were held on 16th and 25th\n\nJuly  2018  and  social  media  has  also  been  used  to  encourage  participation.  Comments\n\nmade by the public have been taken into account in the formulation of this policy paper.\n\nThis  paper  examines  the  issues,  considers  options  and  makes  recommendations  for\n\nfundamental reform of the town planning legislation in Barbados.  This reform is essential\n\nto provide a fit for purpose planning system which regains the trust and confidence of\n\nthe Barbadian people.  However, it is recognised at the outset that legislative reform on\n\nits  own  is  not  enough.    It  must  be  accompanied  by  fundamental  reform  of  our\n\nmanagement processes and practices if it is to be fully successful.\n\nTo guide the review process, the following policy goals and principles were established:\n\n1.  Goal 1 - Transparency and accountability\n2.  Goal 2 - Openness and inclusiveness\n3.  Goal 3 - Efficiency and effectiveness\n4.  Goal 4 - Sustainable Development\n5.  Goal 5 - Fit for purpose\n\n1\n\n\fIn delivering these goals the principles of good governance, e-government, consultation\n\nand  participation  and  pro-active  management  should  also  be  applied.    The  report\n\nconsiders  governance  issues,  a  range  of  strategic  policy  considerations,  together  with\n\ncross cutting and implementation issues. This executive summary highlights the higher\n\norder issues and main changes proposed which will require decision.\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\nThere  are  three  basic  models  of  governance  found  in  planning  legislation  in  the\n\nCommonwealth Caribbean.\n\na)\n\nThe Ministerial Model\n\nThis  is  the  model  currently  in  operation  in  Barbados.    Under  this  arrangement,  the\n\nresponsibility  for  administering  the  legislation  is  vested  in  the  Minister,  but  there  is\n\nconsiderable  delegation  to  the  Chief  Town  Planner.    The  Minister  has  the  power  to\n\ndetermine  certain  classes  of  application  and  to  decide  appeals.    The  way  the  system\n\noperates is very opaque, it is susceptible to politicization, and there is scope for personal\n\ncorruption.  It is also  narrowly technically  based with limited coordination with other\n\nregulatory  agencies.  There  is,  however,  political  accountability  and  the  costs  of\n\nadministration are relatively low.\n\nb)  The Statutory Corporation Model\n\nIn  this  arrangement,  the  powers  are  vested  in  a  statutory  corporation  with  a  Board\n\nappointed by the Minister.  This model has limited direct accountability and costs are\n\nhigh as Statutory Corporations are responsible for their own finances, fixed assets and\n\npersonnel.    Although  theoretically  more  independent,  they  are  often  liable  to  political\n\ninterference.\n\nc)\n\nThe Hybrid Model\n\nThis  model  vests  a  statutory  Board  with  the  responsibility  for  decision-making.    The\n\nBoard is multi-disciplinary and includes representatives from regulatory authorities and\n\nthe private sector and is serviced by the TCPDO.  Collective decision-making increases\n\ntransparency, providing conflicts of interest are clarified. As part of this model, a Tribunal\n\nwould hear Appeals. The Minister would retain the power to determine certain classes\n\nof development. The costs associated with this option are modest.\n\n2\n\n\fProposed Changes\n\nThe Hybrid model is recommended but will require clear regulations to govern its\n\noperation.\n\nSTRATEGIC POLICY INTERVENTIONS\n\nPhysical Development Planning\n\nThe Physical Development Plan provides the policy framework to guide development.\n\nThe  current  Physical  Development  Plan  amended  (2003)  is  in  the  process  of  being\n\nreviewed with the revised plan awaiting formal consultation and approval.\n\nThe PDPs have served Barbados well but there are issues around the legal status of the\n\nplan itself, its content, any lower tier local plans, the provision for public participation\n\nand the frequency of its review.\n\nProposed changes\n\nIt is recommended that:\n\n  The status of the development plan be made more explicit with a presumption\nin favour of the development plan that decisions must be made in accordance\nwith the plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise.\n\n  The second schedule be amended to clarify the status of different types of\nplans and make provision for national park planning, conservation area\nplanning and other types of plans including non- spatial plans and\nsupplementary planning documents.\n\n  Guidelines for public participation are put in place for the plan preparation\n\nand adoption process\n\n  Consideration be given to appointing a Development Plan Tribunal to\n\nconsider representations\n\n  The period for the review of the plan be increased from 5 years to 10 years\n  Greater emphasis is placed on aspects of implementation other than just\n\ndevelopment control\n\n3\n\n\fRegulation of Land Development\n\nThe  purpose  of  planning  legislation  is  to  provide  for  the  orderly  and  progressive\n\n“development of land”.  Development is defined as -\n\n  The carrying out of building, engineering, mining or other operations in, on or\n\nunder any land\n\n  The making of any material changes in the use of any buildings or land\n  The subdivision of land\n\nThe definition of land includes the seabed underlying the Territorial Waters of Barbados.\n\nThe definition of development is broadly satisfactory although there is a need to consider\n\nthe inclusion of demolition (particularly in relation to listed buildings) and to ensure that\n\nsand  mining  is  also  covered.    The  subdivision  provisions  have  also  created  some\n\nproblems in relation to servicing and maintenance of vacant lots.  Consideration could be\n\ngiven to creating a new class of subdivision or severance for small scale division of lots\n\nin already serviced areas\n\n There are two classes of application – outline and full. Some suggestions have been made\n\nthat  it might  be possible to also distinguish between simple and  complex  applications\n\nand this could also be reflected in the time limits for processing applications.\n\nSome types of development are deemed to be permitted and are set out in the Town and\n\nCountry Planning Development Order. This order is in need of revision and updating.\n\nThere  are  certain  categories  of  application  that  are  determined  by  the  Minister  and\n\nprovisions exist for having a hearing.  This element of the system is prone to long delays\n\nand the existing arrangements have been discredited because of lack of transparency and\n\nthe capabilities of the persons conducting hearings.\n\nBarbados  has  entered  into  international  commitments  to  undertake  Environmental\n\nImpact Assessments (EIAs) on proposed activities which are likely to have an adverse\n\neffect  on  the  environment  but  to  date  there  is  no  comprehensive  legal  framework\n\ncovering this.  An EIA Regulation should be prepared as a matter of urgency to clarify\n\nwhen an EIA is required, how it should be conducted and how the mitigation measures\n\nproposed will be monitored.\n\n4\n\n\fThere is similarly a need to clarify the ways in which the Coastal Zone Management Act\n\nand the Town and Country Planning Act interact and the role of the CZMU in decision-\n\nmaking on planning applications\n\nThere is also a need to strengthen the provisions relating to the conservation of the built\n\nheritage (buildings and areas) and the protection of trees.\n\nProposed changes\n\n  To consider changes to the definition of development to include the\ndemolition or the making of material alterations to a listed building.\n\n  To consider if it is appropriate to introduce a definition of simple and complex\n\napplications\n\n  To consider introducing a new category of certified development\n  To impose requirements on subdivisions for maintenance of the infrastructure\n\nand open spaces\n\n  To create a new category of severance for small subdivisions in areas already\n\nserviced\n\n  To review the schedule of Permitted Development (and associated conditions)\n\nand the Use Classes Order to reflect changing circumstances\n\n  Decisions on applications should be made by a new Sustainable Development\nBoard.  This Board should comprise ex-officio public officials and private\nsector representatives and the CTP should serve as the CEO/Secretary of the\nBoard\n\n  Applications referred to the Minister for decision should be significant\n\ndepartures from the PDP and/or matters of strategic economic or\nenvironmental importance. A qualified inspector should hold a hearing and\nreport to the Minister on these applications.  Rules for the conduct of hearings\nand site visits should be clarified and any report or decision should be made\npublicly available. Strict timetables should be adhered to\n\n  Published statements of planning policy related to site development standards\n\n\n\nshould be formally adopted by the Minister\n EIA Regulations should be prepared to clarify the process and put it on a legal\nfooting\n\n  The role of the CZMU in planning applications in the coastal zone and in\n\nfuture on the seabed outside the coastal zone should be clarified\n\n  Provision for making and updating the register of listed buildings should be\nstrengthened and made more transparent and the declaration of conservation\nareas put on a legal footing and the use of Heritage Impact Assessments\nclarified\n\n5\n\n\f  Consideration should be given to having a sub-committee to advise the Board\n\non design and conservation matters\n\n  Consideration be given to developing and implementing an Empty Property\n\nStrategy\n\n  Provisions are made for the use of compulsory powers to support this strategy\n  The Tree (Preservation) Act should be repealed and its provisions incorporated\ninto the new Town and Country Planning Act including a new definition of\n“tree”.  The powers currently assigned to the Minister under these provisions\nshould be transferred to the Sustainable Development Board\n\nPlanning Obligations\n\nThe concept of planning obligations was first introduced to Barbados by the Town and\n\nCountry Planning (Amendment) Act 2007.  In that amendment it was limited to provision\n\nof  affordable  housing.    However,  in  other  jurisdictions  it  is  used  to  fund  a  range  of\n\nphysical, social and environmental requirements.\n\nProposed changes\n\n  To introduce new broader provisions for planning obligations\n\nLimitation Periods\n\nIt is important to set strict timetables for processing applications with some form of\n\nrecourse if they are not met\n\nProposed Changes\n\n  A tiered system of timescales should be introduced with 8 weeks for simple\napplications,13 weeks for complex application and 16 weeks for applications\nrequiring an EIA\n\n  Strict time lines should be adhered from the date of receipt of required\n\ninformation from the applicant\n\n  Consultations with referral agencies should be in accordance with existing\nstrict time lines and consultations should be carried out electronically\n  There should be recourse to appeal to the Board if timelines are not met.\n\n6\n\n\fEnforcement\n\nThe CTP has a great deal of discretion to take action against anyone who is in breach of\n\nthe planning legislation.  The process lacks transparency and the penalties available do\n\nnot act as a deterrent.\n\nProposed changes\n\n  The relevant authority should have to succeed in a prosecution based on an\n\nEnforcement Notice before exercising the power of demolition\n\n  The grounds on which an Enforcement Notice can be appealed to a Judge in\n\nChambers should not be limited\n\n  Provision should be made for appeal against Stop Notices, to avoid the\nnecessity, costs and delays associated with Judicial Review proceedings\n\n  Enforcement and Stop Notices should be prepared and served by persons with\n\nadequate training in legal requirements and procedures\n\n  The CTP should keep a publicly accessible register of Enforcement Action\n\nwhich should be available on-line\n\n  The CTP should report to the Sustainable Development Board on complaints\n\nof breaches and enforcement action taken\n\nAdministrative Fees and Penalties\n\nThe fees charged for planning applications were first introduced in 1970 and have only\n\nbeen reviewed once, in 2009.  Similarly, penalties for breaches in planning regulations\n\nhave never been increased and are now so low that they fail to act as a deterrent.\n\nProposed changes\n\n  A new schedule of fees should be prepared and reviewed annually\n  Penalties and fines should be reviewed to bring them in line with similar\n\noffences\n\n  Fines should be reviewed regularly by the Sustainable Development Board to\n\ntake into account inflation and changing attitudes to the offence\n\nAppeals\n\nS19 of the current legislation provides for an applicant, who is aggrieved by a decision to\n\nrefuse  planning  permission  or  conditions  applied  to  a  permission,  to  appeal  to  the\n\nMinister  to  have  the  decision  reviewed.    It  is  recommended  that  the  duties  currently\n7\n\n\fundertaken by the Minister on recommendation from a person appointed by the Minister\n\nbe  transferred  to  a  Planning  Appeals  Tribunal.    The  Tribunal  should  be  comprised  of\n\nqualified people with relevant planning experience.\n\nProposed changes\n\n  To transfer the responsibility for hearing and deciding on appeals to a\n\nPlanning Appeals Tribunal\n\n  Rules for the conduct of hearings and site visits should be clarified and any\n\nreport or decision should be made publicly available. Strict timetables should\nbe adhered to\n\nCROSS CUTTING ISSUES\n\nPublic Participation and Access to Information\n\nThe principles of public participation in decision-making were enshrined in Principle 10\n\nof  the  1992  Rio  Declaration.    Involvement  of  the  public  is  important  in  the  decision-\n\nmaking  process,  but  many  existing  planning  processes  are  opaque  and  allow  for  no\n\npublic engagement.  This lack of openness leads to a mistrust of the system.  Opening the\n\nsystem up to public scrutiny and involvement is critical to restore confidence.  While the\n\nrecent review of the PDP has illustrated a progressive approach to public engagement,\n\nthe rest of the system has limited participation.\n\n A common complaint of the existing system is the difficulty of accessing  information.\n\nInformation is important to inform effective public participation and to allow individuals\n\nto  track  the  progress  of  planning  applications.    Even  the  current  statutory  register  is\n\ninadequate, providing very little useful information.\n\nProposed changes\n\n  The publication of a meaningful weekly list of applications received and\ndecisions made. This list to be sent to the press and published on-line\n  Explore the possibility of a comprehensive planning portal that can be\n\naccessed by the public to find information on applications, decisions and\nappeals\n\n  Applicants to be required to post a notice on site before the submission of a\n\nplanning application\n\n8\n\n\f  Third party objections should be taken into account when determining an\n\napplication\n\n  The applicant and third parties should be able to submit evidence and speak\n\nbriefly at the Sustainable Development Board\n\nInter-Agency Consultation\n\nThe  performance  of  statutory  consultees  is  one  of  the  main  reasons  for  delays  and\n\ninefficiency in the current system and needs to be addressed.\n\nProposed changes\n\n  Electronic means of communication should be the norm for these\n\nconsultations\n\n  Consideration be given to arranging meetings of all consultees to advise\n\napplicants for large development of what is required and plan a coordinated\nresponse\n\nIMPLEMENTATION\n\nOnce the legislation is in place there will be a need to prepare the more detailed orders\n\nand regulations and to establish the new governance arrangements.  What is proposed is\n\na significant change from existing practices.  For the changes to be successful, there will\n\nbe a need for strong leadership to deliver a change in culture.  Managing this change will\n\nbe critical.  New processes will need to be put in place and training provided to develop\n\nnew skills.\n\nProposed changes\n\n  Introduce change management and training programmes for staff and Board\n\nmembers\n\n  Put in place new procedures and processes\n  Manage pro-actively with performance targets\n  Deliver quick wins (changes that can be introduced easily without legislation\n\nor major funding implications) which will increase transparency and\nefficiency and reinforce the new ways that the service is to be delivered in\nfuture\n\n9\n\n\fCONCLUSION\n\nThis  Green  Paper  highlights  a  number  of  possible  improvements  to  the  existing  town\n\nplanning  system  which  are  aimed  at  delivering  the  broad  goals  of  transparency  and\n\naccountability, openness and inclusiveness, efficiency and effectiveness, and achieving\n\nsustainable development and a system which is tailored to Barbadian society and fit for\n\npurpose.\n\n10\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\n1.

The  existing  law  regarding  land  use  planning  and  development\n\ncontrol, the Town and Country Planning Act, CAP.240 (the Act), was enacted in 1965 and\n\ncame into force on July 8th, 1968, fifty years ago. This legislation was based largely on the\n\neponymous  British  legislation  of  1947;  however,  in  the  absence  of  a  system  of  local\n\ngovernment  in  Barbados,  the  powers  vested  in  the  Local  Authorities  in  Britain  were\n\nconferred on a government official, the Chief Town Planner (CTP), in Barbados. Hence,\n\nfrom  the  inception,  the  regulatory  system  in  Barbados  has  lacked  key  elements  of\n\ntransparency and accountability that are inherent in the British system.\n\nSubstantial amendments have been made to the Act over the years, namely in 1968, 1981,\n\n1983, 1998 and 2007. For the most part, these amendments were designed to import into\n\nthe Act changes in planning law in Britain, with the exception of the amendments made\n\nin 1998  which were  consequential on the enactment of the  Coastal Zone Management\n\nAct, CAP.394. The original legislation envisaged an efficient regulatory process, with a\n\nlimitation  period  of  2  months  for  determining  applications  for  planning  permission,\n\ninclusive of 14 to 21 days for interdepartmental consultations. Embedded amongst the\n\n1981 amendments was a provision which removed the obligation of the CTP to seek the\n\napplicant’s agreement for extensions of the 2-month statutory deadline. It is arguable that\n\n-  in  addition  to  the  growing  complexity  of  information  requirements  in  support  of\n\napplications  -  this  amendment  has  been  the  major  cause  of  the  inordinate  delays  in\n\ndecision-making which now characterize the system.\n\nIn its 2018 report, “Doing Business”, the World Bank ranked Barbados 132nd out of the\n\n190 countries studied with respect to the overall ease of doing business. This represents\n\na slippage of 15 places below its previous position.  A major factor explaining this  low\n\nranking is the fact that Barbados is 155th with respect to dealing with construction permits,\n\nwhich take an average of 442 days (14.5 months) to be approved, in comparison with the\n\naverage  time  of  192  days  (6.3  months)  for  all  countries  in  the  Latin  America  and\n\nCaribbean  region.  Notably,  this  average  delay  in  permitting  exceeds  the  2-month\n\nlimitation period for the determination of applications for planning permission set by the\n\nAct by more than a year.\n\n13\n\n\fIn  its  2018  Manifesto,  “Building  The  Best  Barbados  Together”,  the  Government\n\ncommitted itself to  improving  the quality and speed of delivery of services,  including\n\nTown  and  Country  Planning  permissions,  to  promote  doing  business  with  ease  in\n\nBarbados.  Further,  it  undertook  to  modernize  our  approach  to  Physical  Development\n\nPlanning  by  making  the  development  control  process  transparent  and  accountable  by\n\nproviding, amongst other things, for public comment on development proposals, public\n\nparticipation  in  decision  making,  and  the  publication  of  decisions  and  the  reasons  for\n\napproval or refusal of applications.\n\nThe existing Act and the subsidiary legislation made under it – the Town and Country\n\nPlanning  (Fees)  Regulations,  1970,  S.I.  1970  No.181;  the  Town  and  Country  Planning\n\nDevelopment  Order,  1972,  S.I.  1972  No.75,  and  the  Town  and  Country  Planning\n\nRegulations,  1972,  S.I.  1972  No.76  -  are  all  obsolete  and  not  consistent  with  these\n\nprinciples.  The  review,  repeal  and  replacement  of  the  existing  legislation  are  urgently\n\nneeded as the introduction of transparent and efficient development control processes\n\nwas designated in the Manifesto as “Mission Critical”.\n\nIn  order  to  engage  the  people  of  Barbados  in  the  development  of  new  legislation,  the\n\nPrime  Minister’s  Office  in  partnership  with  the  Barbados  Town  Planning  Society\n\norganised  two  stakeholder  consultations  on  the  reform  of  the  planning  system.  These\n\nwere held on 16th and 25th July 2018 and live-streamed for interactive public participation\n\non\n\nthe  GIS  website.  A  separate  e-mail  address\n\nfor  submitting  comments\n\ntownplanningreform@barbados.gov.bb was also established to allow wider engagement\n\nby the public in suggesting changes.  The issues raised and recommendations made by\n\nparticipants  in  these  stakeholder  events  and  comments  made  by  the  public  have  been\n\ntaken into account in the formulation of this policy paper.\n\n2.\n\nPOLICY GOALS AND PRINCIPLES\n\nAs  mentioned  previously  the  Town  and  Country  Planning  Act,  enacted  in  1965,  was\n\nlargely based on earlier UK legislation.  The system was devised for a different era and\n\nhas its roots in a different place.  Nearly 52 years after Independence, it is right that we\n\nrevisit this issue and come up with legislation that is relevant to a 21st Century Barbados.\n\nOur current system is neither efficient in its approach nor transparent in its application.\n\n14\n\n\fIt is seen as a barrier to investment and at the same time lacks the teeth to protect our\n\nfragile environment and cultural heritage.\n\nThe Government has established a governance model for approaching reform which has\n\nbeen used as a starting point for identifying the policy goals and principles that should\n\nguide this reform.  The questions posed are as follows:\n\n1.  What is the public interest that the Government must seek to protect?\n2.  What is the public mischief against which the government must guard?\n3.  How might the use of technology help the government achieve national goals?\n4.  What  are  the  social  justice  issues  which  the  government  needs  to  take  into\n\naccount?\n\n5.  What structures and processes can government put in place to obtain the views of\n\nBarbadians and include them in decision making?\n\nGoals\n\nThe  following  goals  will  guide  the  review  process  and  proposed  changes  should  be\n\nmeasured against them.\n\n1.  GOAL 1: Transparency and accountability\n\nAll decisions in the town planning system should be made in a way that it is clear\n\nabout who or what body has made the decision and why the decision has been\n\nmade.\n\n2.  GOAL 2: Openness and inclusiveness\n\nMembers of the public should be able to input into the decision making process.\n\nWhere possible decisions should be made in public and individuals should have\n\na right  to have their views heard.   Public registers should be accessible  in hard\n\ncopy and on line.\n\n3.  GOAL 3:  Efficiency and effectiveness\n\nDecisions should be made in a timely manner, and prescribed timescales should\n\nbe adhered to by all parties.\n\n4.  GOAL 4: Sustainable development\n\nDecisions should be guided by the principles of sustainable development ensuring\n\nlong term environmental, economic and community health and wellbeing.\n\n15\n\n\f5.  GOAL5: Fit for purpose\n\nAll  legislation,  regulations,  policies  and  procedures  should  be  fit  for  purpose.\n\nThey should reflect the specific needs of Barbados as a small island state in the 21st\n\ncentury.\n\nPrinciples\n\n1.  PRINCIPLE 1: Good Governance\n\nGood governance is critical to ensure trust and confidence in the system.  In a small\n\nand  interconnected  society  like  Barbados  it  is  important  to  guard  against  the\n\ninfluence  exercised  by  proximity  and  the  potential  for  corruption.    Governance\n\narrangements should be put in place that reduce the potential for undue influence\n\nor  corruption  and  require  high  standards  of  integrity  including  declarations  of\n\ninterest.\n\n2.  PRINCIPLE 2: E-Government (digital by default)\n\nIn the 21st Century the maximum use should be made of e-government.  The Town\n\nPlanning system should be computerised in a way that allows easy access by the\n\npublic  to  information,  more  efficient  consultations  and  reduces  bureaucratic\n\ndelays.    Improved  platforms  for  data  sharing  and  providing  management\n\ninformation  should  be  used  to  improve  plan  making,  provide  evidence  based\n\npolicy decisions, improved management information, as well as improvements to\n\nthe user experience.\n\n3.  PRINCIPLE 3: Consultation and participation.\n\nBoth  the  plan  making  process  and  the  regulation  of  development  should\n\nencourage  public  participation.    An  ability  to  influence  decisions  will  help\n\nimprove  the  public  understanding  of  the  planning  system  and  make  it  a  more\n\nvalued and trusted part of government activity.\n\n4.  PRINCIPLE 4: Proactive Management\n\nA  new culture of proactive management  which encourages interaction with the\n\npublic  and  is  focused  on  enabling  and  facilitating  high  quality  sustainable\n\ndevelopment  not  just  controlling  and  regulating  development,  will  require  a\n\nculture change.  It will also need to proactively monitor and manage performance\n\nto achieve the necessary improvements.\n\n16\n\n\f3.\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\nMajor changes to the existing administrative provisions for governance of  the physical\n\ndevelopment planning and development control processes that are provided for by the\n\nexisting planning legislation are necessary in order to conform to the policy goals and\n\nprinciples enunciated above.\n\nThere  are  three  basic  types  of  administrative  arrangements  to  be  found  in  planning\n\nlegislation  in the Commonwealth Caribbean. Each has advantages  and disadvantages.\n\nThese can be summarized as follows.\n\na)\n\nThe Ministerial Model\n\nIn countries where this structure is in place, including Barbados, responsibility for the\n\nadministration of the legislation is vested in a Minister and it is administered in practice\n\nby a department within the Ministry. In some countries where this structure is in place,\n\nthe legislation does not even mention the relevant department. Barbados is the exception\n\nin  that  the  existing  legislation  expressly  states  that  the  CTP  is  responsible  for  the\n\npreparation  of  development  plans  and,  except  in  specified  cases,  for  determining\n\napplications for planning permission. The Minister has the power to determine specific\n\ntypes  of  applications  and  to  decide  appeals  against  decisions  of  the  CTP.    There  is\n\nprovision for the appointment by the Minister of a Town and Country Planning Advisory\n\nCommittee, but the role of this body is purely advisory and limited in remit to matters\n\non which the Minister seeks its advice.\n\nThe advantages of this arrangement are that the Minister has ultimate authority over the\n\nprocesses  of  development  planning  and  development  control  for  which  he/she  is\n\nresponsible  to  Parliament.  Additionally,  the  overhead  costs  of  administration  are\n\nrelatively low because there are shared with the Ministry and, to some extent, the public\n\nservice as a whole. The disadvantages of this arrangement  are that decision-making  is\n\nsusceptible to politicization; inputs from other regulatory agencies are not a priority for\n\nthose  bodies;  and  decisions  tend  to  be  made  on  a  narrow  technical  basis.  The\n\norganizational  culture  tends  to  be  bureaucratic  and  decision-making  opaque.  Hence,\n\nthere is scope for influence peddling and personal corruption and a pervading suspicion\n\nthat corruption exists. This undermines the credibility of the system.\n\n17\n\n\fb)  The Statutory Corporation Model\n\nIn countries where this structure is in place, responsibility for the administration of the\n\nlegislation is vested in a statutory corporation with a Board of Directors appointed by the\n\nMinister,  which  includes  members  of  civil  society.  The  Board  is  responsible  for\n\nadministering the law in accordance with policy directions received from the Minister,\n\nbut the law is administered in practice by the staff of the statutory corporation under the\n\ngeneral  supervision  of  the  Board.  Appeals  from  decisions  of  the  staff  of  the  statutory\n\ncorporation are usually to a court of law.\n\nThe theoretical advantages of this arrangement are that the body corporate enjoys greater\n\nautonomy than a department of government; the oversight of technical decision-makers\n\nby a Board inclusive of members of civil society broadens the perspectives of the agency;\n\nthe ability of the corporation to hire staff on better terms than are available in the public\n\nservice permits it to compete with the private sector for human resources; and it should\n\nhave  a  business-like  corporate  rather  than  bureaucratic  organizational  culture.  The\n\ndisadvantages of this  arrangement  are that the Minister has only indirect control over\n\nmatters  for  which  he/she  is  responsible  to  Parliament;  and  the  overhead  costs  of  the\n\ninstitution  are  relatively  high,  as  a  statutory  corporation  is  responsible  for  the\n\nmanagement of its own finances, fixed assets, and personnel.\n\nExperience  in  the  Commonwealth  Caribbean  has  shown  that  most  of  the  theoretical\n\nadvantages of statutory corporations are illusory. Appointments to the Boards are often\n\nmade on the basis of political allegiance, rather than professional competence, and the\n\npowers  of  the  Minister  to  give  directions  to  the  Board  are  used  to  micro-manage  the\n\nsupposedly  semi-autonomous  agencies.  Further,  most  of  these  agencies  are  staffed  by\n\nformer public servants or public servants seconded from various departments; hence, the\n\nculture remains bureaucratic.\n\nc)\n\nThe Hybrid Model\n\nIn  the  countries  where  this  structure  is  in  place,  namely  all  the  OECS  countries,\n\nresponsibility for the administration of the legislation is vested in a statutory Board with\n\nexecutive  powers  that  is  comprised  of  ex  officio  members  from  relevant  government\n\ndepartments and persons from the private sector appointed by the Minister. The day to\n\nday  discharge  of  the  development  control  functions  provided  for  by  the  legislation,\n\nincluding the receipt and processing of applications for planning permission, is carried\n\n18\n\n\fout by a department of the Ministry and the head of that department is designated as the\n\nExecutive  Secretary  of  the  Board  and/or  its  Chief  Executive  Officer.  Appeals  against\n\ndecisions of the Board are heard by an Appeals Tribunal appointed under the Act. The\n\nMinister/Cabinet  retains  the  power  to  determine  specific  applications  or  classes  of\n\napplications.\n\nThe principal advantage of this hybrid arrangement is that most decisions are made by a\n\nmulti-disciplinary body which includes representatives of other regulatory agencies and\n\nof civil society. This improves inter-agency coordination, allows for a sharing of expertise\n\nthat  reduces  the  duplication  of  functions  within  the  public  service  and  promotes\n\npragmatism  in  decision-making.  Moreover,  the  collective  decision-making  process\n\npromotes transparency and discourages personal corruption. Additionally, the overhead\n\ncosts are low because the statutory Board does not have staff of its own but is supported\n\nby the Ministry. The principal disadvantage of this arrangement is that in small societies\n\nBoard members are susceptible to conflicts of  interests; so this needs to be  adequately\n\nguarded against in the legislation. A particular weakness of this model as it operates in\n\nthe OCES countries is that development control is divorced from development planning\n\nand is undertaken in  the absence of a land use plan and/or published policy documents.\n\nHence,  decision-making  is  necessarily  ad  hoc;  however,  this  will  not  be  the  case  in\n\nBarbados where both a statutory plan and published policy documents exist.\n\nRecommendations -\n\nOn the basis of decades of experience with the operation of these three types of systems\n\nin  SIDS  in  the  Commonwealth  Caribbean,  it  is  strongly  recommended  that  the\n\ngovernance structure for the new planning legislation in Barbados should be based on\n\nthe  hybrid  model.  Further  details  of  the  proposed  governance  arrangements  will  be\n\ndiscussed  in  the  following  sections  of  this  paper;  however,  the  main  features  of  the\n\nproposed arrangements are that -\n\n  The Minister will retain the power to determine specific classes of applications and\n\nhave  the  power  to  appoint  the  private  sector  members  of  the  Sustainable\n\nDevelopment Board and the Appeals Tribunal.\n\n  Additionally,  the  Minister  will  have  oversight  of  the  department  of  his/her\n\nMinistry (the TCPDO) responsible for carrying out the day to day work of physical\n\ndevelopment planning and development control;\n\n19\n\n\f  Decisions on routine applications for planning permission will be made by a multi-\n\ndisciplinary statutory Board (the Sustainable Development Board), inclusive of the\n\nrepresentatives of the agencies which are routinely consulted about applications\n\nand stakeholders from the private sector. This will introduce transparency into the\n\ndecision-making process and eliminate opportunities for personal corruption;\n  Delays  caused  by  the  referral  of  applications  to  other  regulatory  agencies  for\n\nstatutory consultations  will  be minimized  by the inclusion of representatives of\n\nthe key agencies on the Board as ex officio members;\n\n  The  appointment  of  private  sector  members  to  the  Board,  nominated  by\n\nprofessional  bodies  and  organizations  representing  business  interests,  will\n\nprovide  for  stakeholder  involvement  in  decision-making  and  for  pragmatic\n\nconsiderations to be taken into account in regulatory decision-making;\n\n\n\nIt  is  recommended  that  the  formal  title  of  the  Board  should  be  the  Sustainable\n\nDevelopment  Board  to  reflect  a  positive  approach  to  high  quality  development\n\nand commitment to achieving environmental standards;\n\n  Appeals  against  decisions  of  the  Board  will  be  heard  and  decided  by  a  capable\n\nAppeals Tribunal with due process guarantees;\n\n  The  jurisdiction  of  this  Tribunal  could  extend  to  the  hearing  of  appeals  against\n\nadministrative decisions made under other regulatory laws governing land use,\n\ndevelopment and the environment;\n\n  Meetings of the Board and the Tribunal should be conducted in public;\n  Administrative  costs  will  be  minimized  and  adequate  provision  made  for  cost\n\nrecovery.\n\n### 4.  STRATEGIES\n\n#### A.  Physical Development Planning\n\nA  development  plan  is  commonly  recognized  as  a  policy  framework  representing  a\n\nGovernment’s  vision  for  land  use  and  development.  This  framework  is  then  used  to\n\nguide  and  facilitate  the  development  of  individual  land  parcels  within  a  specific\n\njurisdiction.\n\n1)\n\nType/Hierarchy of Plans\n\nSubsections  5(1)  and  (2)  of  the  existing  Act  make  provision  for  the  preparation  of  a\n\ndevelopment plan for the whole island. Section 2 refers to a development plan consisting\n20\n\n\fof a report of an island survey together with a plan proposing how land may be used and\n\nthe stages for the carrying out of any proposed development.\n\nSection 6(1) indicates that the national development plan may allocate sites and areas of\n\nland for roads, public and other buildings and works, air-fields, parks, pleasure grounds,\n\nnature  reserves,  open  spaces,  agriculture,  residential,  industrial,  commercial  or  other\n\npurposes.  The  national  development  plan  would  also  designate  land  subject  to\n\ncompulsory acquisition by the Crown\n\nThe Act further makes provision in s.6(2) for the preparation of development plans for\n\nparts  of  the  island  at  a  more  in-depth  level  through  the  defining  of  areas  for  a\n\ncomprehensive  development  plan.  This  second  tier  of  development  planning  may  be\n\ndefined  by  the  CTP  under  the  current  administrative  arrangements.  A  comprehensive\n\ndevelopment plan may be prepared for an area to be developed or redeveloped. The Act\n\ndoes  not  specify  the  level  or  type  of  development  planning  within  the  notion  of  a\n\ncomprehensive development plan leaving this up to the professional judgement of the\n\nCTP.\n\nUnder s.6(2) of the Act, a comprehensive development plan for an area that should be\n\ndeveloped  or  redeveloped  may  address:  bad  lay-out  or  obsolete  development;  the\n\nrelocation of population or industry or the replacement of open space in the course of the\n\ndevelopment or re-development of any other area; or any other purpose specified in the\n\nplan.\n\nThe Second Schedule of the Act makes specific provision for those matters that may be\n\nincluded in a development plan. Part 1- Roads; Part II – Buildings and Other Structures;\n\nPart  III  –  Community  Planning;  Part  IV  –  Amenities  (including  allocation  of  lands  for\n\nburial  grounds  and  crematoria,  communal  parks,  birds  and  sanctuaries,  protection  of\n\nmarine  life,  preservation  of  buildings,  caves,  sites  and  objects  of  artistic,  architectural,\n\narchaeological  or  historic  interest,  preservation  or  protection  of  forests,  woods,  trees\n\nshrub,  plants  and  flowers);  Part  V  –  Public  Services,  Part  VI  -  Transport  and\n\nCommunication, Part VII – Miscellaneous.\n\nIn  the  Barbados  Physical  Development  Plan  1988,  under  the  “Plan  Implementation”\n\nsection, there  is mention of the introduction of a three-tier planning system - national,\n\nintermediate  and  local  area  levels.  In  the  Barbados  Physical  Development  Plan  2003,\n\n21\n\n\freference is made to the national plan as a framework for detailed “structure plans” and\n\n“local area plans”. Also, in the PDP 2003, there is the inclusion a National Park Plan which\n\nis a subject area plan and five (5) community plans that represent the detailed planning\n\ngoals  and  objectives  for  the  specified  communities.    There  was  no  updating  of  any\n\nlegislative measures to reflect these changes and none was necessary given the flexibility\n\nthat resides in the current Act for a second tier of development planning.  On this basis,\n\ndevelopment plans may be prepared for any area of the island as the society experiences\n\nchanges in socio-economic conditions and may find itself having to deal with new and\n\nemerging issues over time.\n\nThrough  a  review  of  other  Caribbean  jurisdictions  such  as  the  Cayman  Islands  and\n\nBermuda, the identification of a hierarchy of plans seems often to correspond with the\n\npresence  of  a  decentralised  system  of  governance.  For  example,  in  Bermuda  the\n\nlegislation specifically makes provision for the preparation of a development plan for the\n\nCity of Hamilton, the capital, and one of two municipal sub-national entities. Similarly,\n\nin the United Kingdom, there is a National Planning Policy Framework and guidance to\n\nwhich Council’s Local Plans must conform and there is also provision for supplementary\n\nplanning documents which when approved form part of the Local Plan.  In addition it is\n\npossible  for  local  communities  to  trigger  neighbourhood  plans  which  can  also  be\n\napproved and become part of the statutory local plan.\n\nIt is recommended that consideration be given to the inclusion of a development plan for\n\nthe City of Bridgetown and that consideration be given to awarding this capital area the\n\nstatus of a municipality under the relevant legislation. It is recommended also that the\n\nrelationship  between  the  national  plan  and  other  comprehensive  development  plans\n\n(local, community, regional, conservation, heritage, park, and so forth) be clearly stated.\n\nThe hierarchical planning system in Southern Australia, for example, explicitly states that\n\nplans  for  the  lower  level  tiers  must  reflect  policies  outlined  in  the  planning  strategies\n\noutlined in the tier above and as such must be reviewed to remain consistent. In this vein,\n\nall  comprehensive  development  plans  must  adhere  to  the  strategies  as  set  out  in  the\n\nnational plan.\n\nAs  stated  earlier,  the  Second  Schedule  of  the  Act  offers  a  list  of  matters  for  which\n\nprovision may be made in the development plans. Specifically, community planning is\n\nmentioned  in  Part  III  but  no  other  type  of  comprehensive  development  plan.  A  wide\n\nrange of area plans have been prepared by the Town and Country Development Planning\n\n22\n\n\fOffice (TCPDO) over the years, including the Greater Bridgetown Development Plan of\n\n1988.    It  is  recommended  that  the  Second  Schedule  may  be  amended  to  remove\n\n“Community Planning” and replace this with a list of essential components for all types\n\nof  comprehensive  development  plans.  Alternatively,  a  broader  list  of  possible\n\ncomprehensive development plans should be added for the purposes of the second tier\n\nof  development  planning.  Provision  may  be  made  for  national  park  planning,\n\nconservation area planning, heritage area planning, among others.\n\nThere are also a number of policy issues which are non-spatial in nature.  Such policies\n\nwhich are  important to guide development also need to be put on a statutory footing.\n\nProvision  should  be  made  for  preparing  and  adopting  such  supplementary  planning\n\ndocuments as part of the Physical, Development Plan.  These could include for example\n\na policy on urban design and a high buildings policy.\n\n2)\n\nStatus of Plans\n\nThe  current  Act  does  not  speak  specifically  to  the  status  of  a  Development  Plan  as  a\n\ndecision making tool.  The Act is approved by Parliament as recorded in s.10(2) and for\n\nthe purposes of decision making the Act states in s.16(1) that the development plan could\n\nbe one of a number of items considered to be a material  consideration in the decision\n\nmaking  process  as  follows:  “Subject  to  this  section  and  sections  17  and  18,  where\n\napplication is made to the Chief Town Planner for planning permission, that officer, in\n\ndealing  with  the  applications,  shall  have  regard  to  the  provisions  of  the  development\n\nplan, so far as material to the application and to any other material considerations.”\n\nIn contrast to the approach taken in CAP 240, there is a presumption in English law in\n\nfavour of the Development Plan. This is stated in s.38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory\n\nPurchase Act 2004 as, “If regard is to be had to the development plan for the purpose of\n\nany determination to be made under the planning Acts the determination must be made\n\nin  accordance  with  the  plan  unless  material  considerations  indicate  otherwise”.    The\n\nEnglish case law on this presumption follows the wording of the Act, but leaves it to the\n\ndecision maker to determine the weight that should be given to material considerations.\n\nGiven the manner in which the status of the PDP is represented in the Barbados Act, there\n\nhave been conflicting rulings in the Courts on its role in decision making for development\n\nactivity.\n\n23\n\n\fAn early comment on the lack of clarity on the role of the development plan is included\n\nin the 1986 Report of the Commission of Enquiry into the Physical Development Plan\n\n1988 by Justice C. Roachford.  Justice Roachford had to make a ruling on the status of the\n\ndevelopment plan prior to assessing public representations of the provisions of the Plan.\n\nHe ruled that the Physical Development Plan was a broad policy document intended to\n\nguide settlement and development patterns for a given period. The development plan\n\nwas  not  to  be  followed  slavishly  but  was  to  be  considered  along  with  other  material\n\nconsiderations such as ministerial policies, existing development rights, the availability\n\nof alternative sites, retention of existing use, fear of setting a precedent. This perspective\n\nwas shared by Sir D. Williams CJ when he passed a judgement in the Oldbury case, R v.\n\nMinister of Housing & Lands ex p. Knitwear Ltd, HCA No.1555/1989.  In that case, the\n\nformer  Chief  Justice  declared  that  the  Physical  Development  Plan  is  a  broad  policy\n\ndocument which is to be seen as only one of the considerations informing decisions on\n\napplications.  The  view  that  the  plan  was  not  binding  was  also  taken  by  the  Court  of\n\nAppeal in the subsequent case of Scotland District Association Inc. v. Attorney General,\n\nMinister of Town & Country Planning & Minister of Health, CA No.17/1996.\n\nIn contrast there is the more recent judgment in the recent case of St. Hill v Chief Town\n\nPlanner  and  Attorney  General,  No.1617  of  2011  (the  Six  Men’s  case),  in  which  Justice\n\nCornelieus opined - regarding the status of the development plan - that it “has the effect\n\nof current law\" (p.45). She continues that, \"The Act states that the Physical Development\n\nPlan is to be seen as a Development Order as provided for under Part 3 of the Act\" (p.45,\n\nparagraph  84).    In  this  same  judgment  she  concluded  that,  \"a  declaration  that  the\n\nDevelopment Plan inclusive of amendments under the Town and Country Planning Act\n\nCap 240 is a statutory instrument is refused\".\n\nThe foregoing is intended to underscore the need for the status of the development plan\n\nto be made explicit. In those jurisdictions reviewed, Cayman. Bermuda, Singapore, the\n\nnational  development  plan  (or  master  plan  in  the  case  of  Singapore)  are  all  statutory\n\ninstruments. This approach is recommended along with a presumption in favour of the\n\ndevelopment  plan  in  the  new  Act,  together  with  supporting  appropriate  governance\n\nmechanisms as deemed necessary.\n\n24\n\n\f3)\n\nPlan Preparation Procedure\n\nSection 8 of the Act states that, “the Chief Town Planner may, during the preparation of\n\na development plan relating to any land or during the preparation of any proposals for\n\nalterations or additions to any such plan, consult such persons or bodies as he thinks fit”.\n\nHence,  the  methodology  for  the  development  plan  preparation  process  is  left  to  the\n\ndiscretion of the CTP under current legislation.\n\nThe preparation of a development plan is a technical process, starting from the defining\n\nof goals through to implementation and monitoring. The stages and steps followed by a\n\nparticular  authority  or  regulatory  body  might  differ.  Also  the  complexity  of  the\n\njurisdiction  and  the  organisation  itself  has  a  direct  impact  on  the  process  adopted.  In\n\nreviewing the development plan-making process in selected jurisdictions, it was noted\n\nthat the importance of having explicit procedures in place for plan-making is a common\n\npractice  for  many  modern  development  planning  systems.  The  Cayman  Islands,\n\nBermuda and Singapore use schedules or equivalent to elaborate on the plan preparation\n\nprocess while in England plan making procedures are detailed in the main sections of the\n\nrelevant Act.\n\n1.Evidence\nGathering and\nConsultation\n\n2.Publication\n\n3.Submission\n\n4.Examination\n\n5.Adoption\n\nFigure 1: Stages of developing a Local Development Plan (adapted from Ministry of Housing Communities &\nLocal Government 2018)\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing it is recommended that plan making procedures be adopted\n\nfor  Barbados  as  deemed  appropriate.  These  might  be  elaborated  in  an  appropriate\n\nSchedule to attend the Act.  Alternatively, the publication of detailed  guidance /advice\n\ndocument may be used to direct the procedures.\n\n25\n\n\f4)\n\nPublic Comment Procedure\n\nSection  9(4)  of  the  current  Act  states  that  before  approving  any  development  plan  or\n\nproposals for the amendment of any such plan, the Minister shall cause to be published\n\nin three issues of the Official Gazette and of at least one newspaper published in the Island\n\na notice: (a) stating that a development plan, or proposals for the amendment of such a\n\nplan, have been prepared by the CTP; (b) naming the place or places where copies of the\n\nplan or proposals may be inspected and purchased by the public; and (c) stating the time\n\n(being  not  less  than  twenty-eight  days  from  the  last  publication  of  such  notice  in  the\n\nOfficial Gazette ) within which objections or representations may be made to the Minister\n\nwith respect to the plan or proposals.\n\nCurrently, procedures for public participation in the development plan process relate to\n\ninspection  of  the  draft  development  plan  before  it  is  adopted  by  the  Government.\n\nHowever, it is widely acknowledged that involving the community in development plan\n\npreparation is one of the most important components in plan making as the community\n\nmembers know best their local issues and possible solutions. The whole aim of having a\n\ndevelopment plan is to guide and facilitate development  for the residents of the place\n\nand business operators. It therefore becomes essential to take their views, objections and\n\nsuggestions into account during the plan preparation process.\n\nAlthough there are currently no statutory requirements for early consultation, there was\n\nextensive public participation in the preparation of the 2017 draft PDP amendment in line\n\nwith good practice.\n\nThe  legal  position  is  clearer  elsewhere.    For  example,  in  England,  local  councils  must\n\nfacilitate discussions and consultation with local communities and other stakeholders in\n\nthe initial stage of preparing a Local Development Plan. This form of consultation may\n\nbe done at public events, panel discussions, leaflets, press articles or council magazines.\n\nProvision  might  also  be  made  for  the  use  of  social  media  to  engage  stakeholders.\n\nFollowing the evidence gathering stage, the local council is required to publish the Local\n\nPlan for consultation, which must take place for a minimum of six weeks.\n\n26\n\n\fFigure 2: Opportunities for public comment in the preparation of Local Development Plans (sourced from Campaign\nto Protect Rural England 2018)\n\nIt is recognized that managing numerous stakeholders can be challenging. Therefore it is\n\nrecommended, for Barbados, that guidelines for public participation procedures be put\n\nin  place  for  plan  preparation  and  adoption  processes.    The  guidelines  for  public\n\nparticipation may be included in appropriate schedules to the Act or through the use of\n\nguidance/ advice notes.\n\n5)  Adoption of Plans\n\nA procedure for the adoption of development plans is outlined in Sections 9 and 10 of the\n\ncurrent Act. Before approval of a development plan or proposals for the amendment of\n\nany such plan, the Minister responsible for planning has to place an official notice in the\n\npublic domain indicating that the Plan has been prepared, name the place or places where\n\nthe Plan may be inspected by the public and state the time period (usually 28 days from\n\nlast  public  notice)  within  which  objections  or  representations  may  be  made  to  the\n\nMinister. A Commissioner is appointed to consider objections and representations from\n\nthe public using established regulatory proceedings for public enquiry.\n\n27\n\n\fSection 10 states: (1) Notice shall be published in three issues of the Official Gazette and\n\nof at least one newspaper published in the Island of the approval by the Minister of a\n\ndevelopment plan or of proposals for amendment of such a plan, and copies of any such\n\nplan  or  proposals  as  approved  by  the  Minister  shall  be  available  for  inspection  and\n\npurchase  by  the  public.  (2)  Every  development  plan  or  amendment  of  a  development\n\nplan shall, after approval by the Minister, be submitted for the approval of both Houses\n\nand if approved by resolution of both Houses shall come into operation on such date after\n\nits approval by Parliament as the Minister may appoint by notice published in the Official\n\nGazette.\n\nIn  other  jurisdictions  in  the  region,  there  is  a  similar  procedure  for  the  adoption  of\n\ndevelopment  plans,  giving  opportunities  for  interested  parties  to  object  or  make\n\nrepresentation  with  respect  to  plan  proposals.    In  the  case  of  Bermuda  and  Cayman\n\nIslands, a tribunal is established to consider objections and representations in relation to\n\nthe physical development plan. Specifically, the Development and Planning Act 2017 in\n\nthe Cayman Islands has provision for a Development Plan Tribunal to consider objections\n\nand representations on development plan amendments.\n\nThe  use  of  a  tribunal  to  consider  development  plan  amendments  would  facilitate  the\n\nmovement  of  the  Barbados  planning  system  to  being  a  more  transparent  and\n\nparticipatory process. Also, the modernization of the process should give consideration\n\nto the inclusion of digital (online) technology to deliver official notices to the public and\n\nreceive objections and representations from the public.\n\n6)\n\nFrequency of Review\n\nAccording to Section 11(1) of the Act: At least once in every five years after the date on\n\nwhich a development plan for the whole of the Island comes into operation, the CTP shall\n\ncarry out a fresh survey of the Island and submit to the Minister a report of the survey\n\ntogether with proposals for any alterations or additions to the plan that appear to him to\n\nbe required. (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) the CTP may at any time submit to the\n\nMinister proposals for such alterations or additions to any development plan as appear\n\nto him to be expedient.\n\nThe first physical development plan for Barbados was prepared in 1971 and came into\n\noperation  on  1976.  Subsequent  to  that,  Barbados  has  had  the  benefit  of  an  updated\n\n28\n\n\fphysical development plan in 1986 (adopted in 1991), another update in 2003 (adopted in\n\n2013) and a more recent revision drafted in 2017 (awaiting further directions for an official\n\nprocess of public participation as defined in the Act).\n\nThe target of a five–year review has never been attained though Barbados is well ahead\n\nof its CARICOM neighbours, some of whom are yet to approve their first national spatial\n\nor physical development plan.  The Barbados system though outdated in its legislation is\n\napparently  still  working  to  produce  essential  policy  directions  for  development  and\n\ninvestment activity. Across the region the five-year review period is reflected in many of\n\nthe  laws  governing  physical  development  planning.  However,  the  availability  of\n\nresources to update a national physical plan every five years has been questioned by a\n\nnumber of stakeholders as revealed in recent consultations on the reform of the planning\n\nsystem. It is noted that in Singapore the national level strategic framework referred to as\n\ntheir concept plan is reviewed every 10 years according to their current legislation. On\n\nthe other hand, the master plan in Singapore which gives more detailed policy guidance\n\nfor site developments is reviewed every 5 years.\n\nConsideration should be given for Barbados to review its national physical development\n\nplan every 10 years bringing the process more in line with the resource availability. The\n\nreview of comprehensive development plans (all second tier development plans) on a\n\nfive-year cycle should also be considered given the openness of this small economy and\n\nvulnerability to global economic changes.\n\n7)\n\nPlan Implementation\n\nThe public perception of town planning is one that is dominated by development control.\n\nThis is understandable given that most members of the public come into contact with the\n\nsystem mainly through the development control process.  However, development control\n\ncan be regarded as one element of development plan implementation.  The main elements\n\nof development plan implementation can be listed as development control, compulsory\n\npurchase, direct action by public bodies, fiscal measures and facilitation:\n\ni.  Development control – The process of deciding planning applications is a crucial\n\nelement  of  implementing  the  vision  for  development  set  out  in  the  Physical\n\nDevelopment  Plan.    It  has  been  recommended  above  that  the  status  of  the\n\ndevelopment plan should be strengthened by introducing a presumption that its\n\npolicies will be followed unless material considerations persuade otherwise.  This\n\n29\n\n\fwill contribute clarity and more certainty to the development control process with\n\nexplanations necessary for any departure from policies set out in the PDP.\nii.  Compulsory Purchase – This can assist in delivering PDP policies.  The purchase\n\nof  land  may  be  needed  to  provide  a  site  for  some  public  facility,  eg  a  school,\n\nhospital, sports ground, etc or to provide infrastructure such as a road widening\n\nscheme.    Alternatively,  compulsory  purchase  can  be  used  to  facilitate  some\n\nprivate  sector  development  that  meets  the  PDP  objectives.    For  instance,  land\n\ncould be acquired as part of a site assembly exercise that would enable a private\n\nsector project of key economic importance to proceed.  Government could either\n\nretain  ownership  as  an  investment  in  the  project  or  sell  on  immediately  and\n\nrecover its costs.\n\niii.  Direct action by public bodies – It may be the statutory function of a Ministry or\n\nstatutory corporation to carry out capital investment to deliver specific projects\n\nin the PDP.  Government could also consider making space available in empty\n\nGovernment-owned  buildings  at  low  or  nominal  rates  on  condition  that  those\n\nbuildings are improved and brought back into use.\n\niv.\n\nFiscal measures – PDP policies may be delivered by a range of fiscal incentives or\n\npenalties.    For  instance,  a  higher  rate  of  tax on  vacant  lots  or  empty  buildings\n\ncould  encourage  owners  to  either  develop  that  property  themselves  or  sell  to\n\nsomeone who will develop it.  There could be similar penalties attached to unused\n\nagricultural land.  Conversely, incentives could be used to encourage people to\n\ncarry out development in line with the PDP.  Such incentives could include tax\n\nrelief  for  investment  in  listed  buildings  or  for  various  energy  conservation  or\n\nrenewable  energy  measures.    The  use  of  these  measures  can  be  targeted  in  an\n\narea-based  fashion,  eg  in  special  development  areas,  conservation  areas,  the\n\nNational Park or the UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nv.  Through  its  contact  with  developers  and  investors  as  part  of  the  development\n\ncontrol  process,  the  TCDPO  is  in  a  position  to  encourage  and  promote\n\ndevelopment that fits with the PDP objectives.  This activity may be difficult to\n\nmeasure  but  can  be  very  effective.    TCDPO  staff  are  not  just  in  a  position  to\n\nnegotiate improvements to planning applications that are submitted but can also\n\nguide applicants to other potential projects.\n\nWhile  recognizing  that  the  TCDPO  is  always  going  to  be  working  under  pressure  to\n\nprocess the workload of planning applications, it is recommended that there should be\n\n30\n\n\fan increased emphasis on other work that supports or promotes achievement of the PDP\n\nobjectives.\n\n#### B.  Regulation of Land Development\n\n1)\n\nExtent of Regulatory Jurisdiction\n\nThe purpose of planning legislation, as stated succinctly in the long title to the existing\n\nlaw, is to provide for the orderly and progressive development of land. Hence, the extent\n\nof  the  jurisdiction  of  relevant  authority  depends  upon  the  meaning  of  the  terms\n\n“development” and “land” as defined by the legislation.\n\nThe approach taken in the existing law, as well as in planning legislation throughout the\n\nCommonwealth Caribbean and in Britain, is to define development in broad terms and\n\nthen  to  cut  down  the  broad  definition  by  specifying  matters  which  do  not  constitute\n\ndevelopment.  The  broad  definition  has  three  limbs:  (1)  the  carrying  out  of  building,\n\nengineering, mining or other operations in, on, over or under any land; (2) the making of\n\nany material change is the use of any buildings or other land; and (3) the subdivision of\n\nland. The matters which would fall within these broad categories but by definition do not\n\nconstitute development are three types of operations and three types of land uses. With\n\nthe  exception  of  the  subdivision  of  land,  which  is  not  included  in  the  definition  of\n\ndevelopment in Britain, there is a great deal of existing jurisprudence on this definition\n\nof development, including the exclusions to the definition, and it is not recommended\n\nthat it be changed, except as outlined below.\n\nAs regards “land”, the definition in the existing law includes the seabed underlying the\n\nTerritorial Waters of Barbados, as well as the foreshore and all land above the Low Water\n\nMark,  which  is  the  limit  of  planning  control  in  Britain.  This  innovation,  made  by  the\n\namendments to the Act in 1968, has since been adopted in other Caribbean SIDS which\n\nhave enacted  modern planning  legislation. This aspect of the regulatory jurisdiction is\n\nexpected  to  become  more  important  in  future  as  Barbados  seeks  to  develop  the  “blue\n\neconomy”.\n\n2)  Building, Engineering, Mining and Other Operations\n\nThe term “operations” in the Act does not have its ordinary dictionary meaning, which\n\nwould include many active processes having no impact on the condition of land; but is\n\nlimited  to  works  of  the  specified  kinds  which  change  the  physical  characteristics  of\n\n31\n\n\fbuildings or other land. Two areas of concern are that it has been held that the category\n\n“other  operations”  does  not  include  demolition  operations,  for  which  planning\n\npermission is not currently required in Barbados. This raised the risk that buildings of\n\ncultural  heritage  significance  can  be  demolished  before  they  are  expressly  protected.\n\nAdditionally, it is essential that mining operations expressly include sand mining. These\n\nissues need to be addressed in the new legislation.\n\nAs  regards  building  operations,  the  CTP  currently  refers  building  plans  to  the\n\ndepartment  of  the  Ministry  responsible  for  public  works  that  is  referred  to  as  the\n\nBarbados Building Authority (although the draft legislation to establish such a statutory\n\nauthority  has  not  been  enacted).  This  department  vets  the  plans  for  conformity  to  the\n\n(draft) Barbados Building  Code, to be made  under the  Standards Act, CAP.326A,  and\n\nadvises  the  CTP  accordingly.  There  is  notable  dissatisfaction  amongst  registered\n\nprofessional  architects  and  engineers  concerning  the  manner  in  which  this  process  is\n\nfunctioning and the institutional arrangements with respect to the Building Code are in\n\nneed of review.\n\nAdditionally, building plans must be approved by the Minister of Health pursuant to the\n\nBuilding Regulations 1969 made under the Health Services Act, CAP.44. The minimum\n\nrequirements with respect to buildings, including requirements with respect to sanitary\n\nconveniences, are set out in the Regulations. Regulation 4 provides that applications must\n\nbe processed within 42 days after receipt and may be refused or granted conditionally;\n\nhowever  reason  must  be  given  for  refusal  or  the  imposition  of  conditions.  Such\n\napplications are currently been processed by the Environmental Protection Department\n\n(EPD), although this Department is no longer within the Ministry of Health, which raises\n\nan  issue  concerning  the  validity  of  approvals  granted  by  the  EPD  on  behalf  of  the\n\nMinister.\n\nHence,  there  is  at  present  some  redundancy  of  regulatory  controls  with  respect  to\n\nbuilding operations between the TCPDO and EPD, to which has been added the referral\n\nof  building  plans  to  the  building  “Authority”  within  the  Ministry  of  Works.  The\n\ndesirability of consolidating these functions into one department which would function\n\nas a “one-stop-shop” for the approval of building plans was discussed in the stakeholder\n\nconsultations. Given the current climate of inefficiency in the TCPDO, practitioners were\n\n32\n\n\freluctant to agree to the allocation of additional functions with respect to the approval of\n\ndetailed building plans to that department.\n\n3)  Material Change of Use\n\nThis expression is not defined in the existing legislation. The expression “change of use”\n\nhas  been  defined  in  legislation  elsewhere  in  the  region,  but  the  key  word  “material”\n\n(meaning significant from a land use planning perspective) has not; however, there is an\n\nabundance of case law on the subject of what constitutes a material change of use of a\n\nbuilding or other land. The concept is dynamic and would not benefit from the inclusion\n\nof a restrictive definition in the new Act.\n\nHowever, there are some inconsistencies in the existing legislation with respects to this\n\ncategory of development, which need to be corrected in the new legislation. The land uses\n\nwhich  are  excluded  from  the  definition  of  development  by  s.13(2)(d),  (e)  and  (f)  are\n\nincluded  in  the  Second  Schedule  to  the  Development  Order  as  forms  of  Permitted\n\nDevelopment. This is incongruous; if these matters do not constitute development they\n\ndo not require permission either on an application for planning permission or by means\n\nof permission granted via a Development Order. It is also recognized that the  existing\n\nUse Classes Order is antiquated and in need of rationalization.\n\n4)\n\nSubdivision of Land\n\nThere is a very broad definition of the term “subdivision” in the existing law; however,\n\nthere is little jurisprudence of this subject as subdivision is not a form of development\n\nsubject  to  planning  control  in  Britain  or  in  some  Commonwealth  Caribbean  countries\n\nwith  very  dated  planning  legislation  (e.g.  Guyana  and  Jamaica).  For  this  reason,\n\nsubdivision control was never properly integrated into the existing planning legislation.\n\nHowever,  subdivision  is  subject  to  regulatory  control  in  Canada  and  there  is  some\n\nrelevant case law from that jurisdiction. Express provisions regarding subdivision have\n\nbeen  included  in  the  modern  planning  legislation  adopted  in  several  Commonwealth\n\nCaribbean countries (e.g. Bermuda, The Bahamas and Nevis).\n\nIt is recommended that adequate provisions with respect to the subdivision of land and\n\nthe provision, and future ownership and maintenance, of infrastructure and open spaces\n\nin  subdivisions,  be  made  the  new  legislation.  This  could  also  distinguish  between  the\n\n33\n\n\fsubdivision  of  raw  land  requiring  new  infrastructure  and  the  simple  division  or\n\nseverance of parcels into two or more lots which are already serviced.\n\n5)\n\nClasses of Applications\n\nUnder  the  existing  legislation,  there  are  two  classes  of  applications  for  planning\n\npermission, outline applications and full or final applications. Outline applications are\n\nprovided for by Paragraph 6 of the Development Order. This provides for the grant of\n\npermission,  which  may  be  conditional,  for  all  aspects  of  the  proposed  development\n\nexcept the matters which are expressly reserved for subsequent approval.  The existing\n\npractice with respect to outline approval is not ideal, as there is a failure to distinguish\n\nclearly  between  the  general  conditions  subject  to  which  approval  is  granted  and  the\n\nreserved matters. It should be noted that, since outline approval constitutes full and final\n\napproval of the development other than as respects reserved matters, under the present\n\nlaw  the  revocation  or  modification  of  outline  approval  can  attract  liability  for  the\n\npayment of compensation by the Minister.\n\nAdditionally, at present the power to grant outline approval is limited to applications for\n\nbuilding operations. It is self-evident that developers proposing to undertake other forms\n\nof development by way of operations and/or subdivision may wish to seek approval in\n\nprinciple  for  such  developments,  before  incurring  the  costs  of  detailed  engineering\n\nand/or architectural designs and environmental impact assessment studies. This should\n\nbe rectified in the new legislation. It would also be advisable to limit the liability of the\n\nCrown with respect to the modification or revocation of such approval in principle.\n\nAnother dimension has been introduced with respect to classes of applications in some\n\nrecent  legislation  in  the  region,  which  distinguish  between  “simple”  and  “complex”\n\napplications for the purposes of regulatory requirements for their processing. The idea of\n\nintroducing this distinction in the new planning legislation in Barbados found favor with\n\nparticipants in the stakeholder consultations held in July 2018. These categories will have\n\nto be carefully defined and the requirements with respect to each category of applications\n\nclearly set out in the new legislation.\n\nIt is recommended that –\n\n  There should be a differentiation between the systems for processing simple and\n\ncomplex plans\n\n34\n\n\f  The current provisions for the grant of outline approval for building operations\n\nshould  be  replaced  by  a  system  of  approval  in  principle  for  any/all  types  of\n\ndevelopment\n\n  Approval in principle should not constitute full and final approval and should be\n\nconditional  and  revocable  on  prescribed  grounds,  without  liability  for  the\n\npayment of compensation\n\n\n\nIn  cases  where  EIA  is  required,  approval  in  principle  could  be  granted  on\n\nsubmission of an initial environmental evaluation, subject to full EIA studies being\n\ncarried out when detailed plans are submitted\n\n6)\n\nPermitted Development\n\nSection 15 of the Act allows the Minister to make a Development Order to provide for the\n\ngrant of planning permission. The Development Order may cover the whole of Barbados\n\nor  any  part  of  it  and  may  either  grant  permission  for  a  development  or  a  class  of\n\ndevelopment specified in the order or provide for the grant of permission by the CTP on\n\napplication  made  to  him.  Permission  can  be  granted  unconditionally  or  subject  to\n\nconditions or limitations specified in the order.\n\nThe categories of Permitted Development are set out in the Town and Country Planning\n\nDevelopment Order 1972.  This order has had minor amendments over the years with the\n\nlast  amendment  being  in  1997.  The  provisions  of  the  Development  Order  concerning\n\nPermitted Development are set out in paragraph 3 of the Order and the Second Schedule\n\nto the Order. This Schedule contains several Parts. Part I contains a listing of the Classes\n\nof development for which permission is granted by the Order and the conditions subject\n\nto  which  such  permission  is  granted.  These  conditions  include  reference  to  Standard\n\nConditions which are set out in Part 2 of the Schedule and cross reference is made in the\n\nStandard Conditions to the Road Classification in Part III of the Schedule. Additionally\n\nPart IV of the Schedule (mistakenly) defines the Use Classes to which the exception in\n\nsection  13(2)(f)  of  the  Act  applies,  which  ought  not  to  form  part  of  the  Schedule  on\n\nPermitted Development.\n\nIn reviewing the system, consideration has  been given to the current UK system from\n\nwhich it was originally derived, other Caribbean countries and Bermuda.  Many of the\n\nCaribbean countries are working on similar outdated legislation although Trinidad and\n\nTobago updated its order in 2015 and the UK equivalent was also revised in 2015.\n\n35\n\n\fIt is clear that the current order is in need of review.  There are many activities which are\n\nnot effectively covered such as renewable energy and areas which need to be expanded\n\nand other areas which could be removed.  The standard conditions applied to permitted\n\ndevelopment are equally out of date and need an overhaul. The road classifications used\n\nin the order have not been updated to reflect current conditions and the water protection\n\nzones are similarly outdated.  Provisions for water use and storage are currently under\n\nreview and would also need amendment. The requirement of standard condition 4 for\n\nthe  CTP  to  be  notified  of  commencement  of  work  to  allow  inspection  could  also  be\n\nreconsidered.\n\nSimilarly, the existing Use Class Order would benefit from refinement. For example, the\n\ncurrent  classification,  includes  restaurants  with  shops  whereas  the  UK  legislation  has\n\nseparate classes for both restaurants and cafes and fast food takeaways.  It might also be\n\nsensible to separate offices into different categories to reflect the nature of their uses and\n\ncompatibility with other uses.  Warehouses that store hazardous materials might benefit\n\nfrom being classified separately from other warehouses. There is currently no separate\n\nclass  for  residential.  Rather  than  including  the  Use  Class  Order  as  a  schedule  to  the\n\nDevelopment Order it would be preferable for this to be a separate Order.\n\nA proposal raised during the consultation process is that in order to reduce the workload\n\nof  the  Planning  Department  a  new  category  of  Certified  Development  could  be\n\nintroduced.  This  would  involve  approved  private  sector  professional  consultants\n\ncertifying that development of a single dwelling in a previously approved subdivision\n\nmet all the required standards.  This would reduce the need for site inspection and speed\n\nup the approval process for residential applications and at the same time free up staff to\n\ndevote time to more complex cases and to enforcement work. Before drafting of the new\n\norders  it  would  be  sensible  to  consult  officers  in  TCDPO  and  the  BTPS  for  their\n\nrecommendations.\n\nProducing a new Development Order provides an opportunity to bring up to date our\n\nexisting regulations, reflecting changes that  have occurred and current demands.  It is\n\nimportant to use this opportunity not only to improve our existing system and correct\n\ncurrent failings but to consider future requirements of the system which are impacted on\n\nby climate change and developing technologies.\n\nRecommendations -\n\n36\n\n\f  To consult with the TCDPO and the BTPS on revisions to the schedule of\n\npermitted development to ensure that the current list is fit for purpose now and\n\nwhere possible is future-proofed\n\n  To review the existing Use Class Order and produce a new order that reflects\n\ncurrent and future uses\n\n  To update standard conditions in consultation with the Barbados Water\n\nAuthority, the Ministry of Transportation and Works, the Coastal Zone\n\nManagement Unit, the Environmental Protection Department and any other\n\nrelevant department or agency\n\n  To consider if permitted development rights should apply across the island or\n\nwhether certain areas eg the Scotland District, the UNESCO World Heritage Site\n\nor Conservation Areas should be excluded.\n\n  Consider introducing a new category of Certified Development\n\n7)  Routine Decisions on Planning Applications\n\nUnder the existing  Act, the CTP has the power to determine applications for planning\n\npermission, except in cases where particular applications or classes of applications are to\n\nbe  referred  to  the  Minister  for  determination,  pursuant  to  directions  published  in  the\n\nOfficial Gazette.\n\nIn dealing with such applications, the CTP has the power to prescribe the form on which\n\napplications  are  to  be  made,  and  the  drawings  and  other  particulars  which  must  be\n\nsubmitted. By virtue of an amendment made to the Act in 1998, these particulars may\n\ninclude an assessment of the impact that the development may have on the environment\n\nof Barbados (an EIA). Additionally, the CTP has the power to require the applicant to\n\nsubmit “such further information as he thinks fit”. Pursuant to the Development Order,\n\nthe  CTP  is  mandated,  before  granting  planning  permission,  to  consult  with  various\n\nstatutory  boards  or  persons,  and  the Minister  has  the  discretion  to  require  the CTP  to\n\nconsult  additional  bodies  or  persons.  The  CTP  may  also  be  required  to  consult  with\n\nspecific persons by virtue of the provisions of other legislation, (e.g. The Director of the\n\nCoastal  Zone  Management  Unit  by  virtue  of  s.33(3)  of  the  Coastal  Zone  Management\n\nAct).\n\nWhen the application requirements have been complied with, the CTP is empowered to\n\ngrant  planning  permission,  unconditionally  or  subject  to  conditions,  or  to  refuse\n\n37\n\n\fpermission, having regard to the provisions of the development plan, so far as material\n\nto  the  application,  and  to  any  other  material  considerations,  giving  reasons  for  that\n\ndecision. This is a very wide discretionary power, which is amplified by the absence of\n\nprescribed development standards and the power of the CTP to relax such standards as\n\nare contained in published policy documents, including the development plan.\n\nThis system is far from satisfactory. It can be criticized as being opaque and lending itself\n\nto influence peddling and personal corruption; but it is also highly inefficient. Besides the\n\nEIA  process  (referred  to  below),  the  principal  identifiable  sources  of  delay  are  the\n\nstatutory  process  of  inter-agency  consultation  with  referral  agencies  (also  discussed\n\nbelow) and the exercise of the power to ask for additional information. In practice the\n\ntime allowed for the receipt of comments from the referral agencies bears no relationship\n\nto the 14 to 21 days allowed by law for the receipt of such advice. Further, requests for\n\nadditional  information  can  be  and  are  made  sequentially  rather  than  up-front,  which\n\nleads to interminable postponements of decisions on complex applications.\n\nIt is recommended that -\n\n  The  TCPDO  should  retain  the  responsibility  for  processing  all  applications  for\n\nplanning permission;\n\n  Strict time lines should be in place for the processing of applications, which may\n\nvary according to the type of applications;\n\n  The power to ask for additional information should be exercised upon submission\n\nof applications and the running of time for the processing of applications should\n\nnot commence until such information has been provided;\n\n  Any  consultations  with  referral  agencies  must  be  carried  out  expeditiously  in\n\naccordance with fixed time limits;\n\n  Where  applicable,  public  consultations  must  be  carried  out  expeditiously  in\n\naccordance with fixed time limits;\n\n  The  power  to  approve  applications,  conditionally  or  unconditionally,  of  refuse\n\npermission  for  development  should  be  vested  in  a  multidisciplinary  statutory\n\nBoard – a Sustainable Development Board - comprised of ex officio members and\n\nprivate sector members appointed by the Minister\n\n  The CTP should serve as the CEO of the Sustainable Development Board\n\n38\n\n\f8)  Ministerial Decisions\n\nThe current arrangements for dealing with planning applications which are “called-in”\n\nor referred to the Minister for determination are much criticised for contributing to delay\n\nin matters which are often of significant economic importance.  The current arrangements\n\nare  also  lacking  in  openness  and  transparency  with  little  regard  for  rules  of  natural\n\njustice.  The process is not adequately managed - staff in the PMO and TCDPO perform\n\nin  a  reactive  rather  than  pro-active  manner  and  there  are  no  performance  targets  or\n\ndeadlines.\n\nSection 18 is the provision of the current Act which provides for the referral of specific\n\napplications or classes of applications to the Minister for decision, instead of being dealt\n\nwith by the CTP.  At present these are all applications in respect of beachfront properties\n\nand all applications for the sub-division or material change of use of agricultural land of\n\nover 2 acres.  These categories were set 32 years ago by a Direction (SI 1986/103) and have\n\nnot been revised since.  Although s.18(1) of the Act allows for the Minister to give the\n\nCTP  directions  to  refer  “any  application”  to  the  Minister  for  determination,  all  such\n\ndirections  must  be  published  in  the  Official  Gazette  pursuant  to  s.2(4)  and  there  is  no\n\nrecord of this having been done.\n\nApplications in the two specified categories may include important developments from\n\na strategic economic or environmental viewpoint.  However, as currently defined, they\n\nmay also include trivial matters which do not necessarily require the Minister’s attention.\n\nAlso, developments of strategic economic or environmental importance, which should\n\nprobably  attract  the  attention  of  the  Minister,  are  not  limited  to  the  two  categories\n\nspecified.\n\nThe  administration  of  the  s.18  process  has  been  made  more  difficult  by  aspects  of  the\n\njudgment of the High Court in the case of St. Hill v Chief Town Planner and Attorney\n\nGeneral, No.1617 of 2011, Judgment of Cornelius J. 25th November 2016, with regard to\n\nchange  of  use  and  development  of  agricultural  land  at  Six  Men’s  Plantation,  St  Peter.\n\nProblematic aspects of this judgment were never appealed and separate administrative\n\narrangements were put in place, in accordance with the judgment, to process applications\n\nreferred  to  the  Minister  within  the  PMO.  The  time  limit  for  appealing  the  judgment\n\nhaving  expired,  legislation  is  now  needed  to  clarify  that  the  Minister  can  expect  the\n\n39\n\n\fTCPDO to process such applications (including conducting statutory consultations) and\n\nalso give a professional opinion on the planning issues.\n\nAs is the case with appeals against decisions of the CTP which are referred to the Minister\n\nfor review (see section 4.G infra), s.18(3) provides that, if either the applicant or the CTP\n\nso  desire,  the  Minister  must  give  them  an  opportunity  of  appearing  before  and  being\n\nheard by a person appointed for that purpose. Hence, most applications referred under\n\ns.18  are  considered  in  a  hearing  chaired  by  a  “panellist”  appointed  by  the Minister  to\n\nreport on the matter.  The  hearings are not open to the public, there are no  published\n\nrules of procedure, there is no regular way for third parties to intervene, there is no two-\n\nway disclosure of documents in advance, the panellist’s report is not made available to\n\neither the applicant or the CTP and under s.18 the Minister is under no obligation to give\n\nreasons for his/her decision. Section 18(4) provides that the Minister’s decision is final;\n\nhowever, such a decision may be challenged in the High Court on the grounds that it is\n\nnot within the powers of the Act, pursuant to s.72.\n\nThere  has  been  criticism  of  the  abilities,  knowledge  and  understanding  of  persons\n\nappointed to conduct hearings.  The appointment process is opaque. There is no stated\n\nrequirement for qualifications or for a track record of relevant experience or knowledge\n\nin  planning,  architecture,  engineering,  surveying,  law  or  other  related  land  use  or\n\nrelevant profession. Panellists are often lay people who have received little or no training\n\nin  planning,  fair  hearing  procedures  or  the  nature  of  their  role.  It  is  not  known  what\n\nweight is given to their reports by the Minister.\n\nThe objective of the referral process should be to provide a system which is both efficient\n\nand at the same time fair, impartial, transparent and independent with no party being at\n\na  disadvantage  and  with  the  rules  of  natural  justice  complied  with.    In  deciding  on  a\n\nframework for the future it is necessary to consider two main elements – governance and\n\nmanagement.  Governance arrangements will be established by the new Act while the\n\nmanagement  issues  will  be  addressed  partly  by  Regulations  and  partly  by  improved\n\nmanagement practices and training.\n\nIn relation to governance it is necessary to consider the extent and nature of Minister’s\n\ndirect involvement in decision-making on planning applications.  In most jurisdictions\n\nthere is a point at which the political leadership will want to have direct influence over\n\n40\n\n\fsome planning matters by making a decision at the political level.  If this is done in an\n\nopen  and  transparent  way  with  publication  of  the  decision  and  its  justification  this  is\n\nclearly  better  than  decision-making  behind  closed  doors  or  the  application  of  covert\n\ninfluence.\n\nThe question then becomes one of which decisions should be determined at the political\n\nlevel.  The current s18 categories are unsatisfactory.  It is suggested that the categories for\n\nreferral  should  be  broadly  defined  in  the  new  Act  as  “significant  departures  from  the\n\nPhysical  Development  Plan  and/or  proposed  developments  of  a  strategic  economic  or\n\nenvironmental  importance”.    If  it  is  decided  to  proceed  with  the  establishment  of  a\n\nSustainable  Development  Board,  then  that  body  should  determine  whether  an\n\napplication should be referred to the Minister for decision.  The Board should make its\n\ndetermination  taking  account  of  the  advice  of  the  CTP  and  in  consultation  with  the\n\nMinister as necessary.\n\nAs the Minister will be making the decision on this class of applications, it is appropriate\n\nthat the Minister should receive a full written report on the case with a recommendation\n\nfrom  the  person  who  conducts  the  hearing  (or  in  a  case  being  decided  on  written\n\nrepresentations  has  reviewed  all  relevant  information).\n\n  For  this  reason,  it  is\n\nrecommended that a suitably qualified Inspector is appointed to deal with each case.  This\n\nmeans  a  person  with  relevant  qualifications  and  experience  in  planning,  architecture,\n\nengineering,  surveying,  law  or  other  related  land  use  or  relevant  profession.    If  it  is\n\ndecided to have a Planning Appeals Tribunal (as recommended in 4. G, below), then the\n\nsame  panel  of  qualified  persons  can  be  used  for  the  appointment  of  Inspectors  for\n\nreferrals.  All appointments to consider a particular case must follow a strict protocol on\n\nconflicts of interest.\n\nIn  the  interests  of  efficiency  as  well  as  openness  and  transparency,  there  is  a  need  for\n\nimprovements to the way the referral process is managed.  Much of this was covered by\n\na consultants’ report in 2013 but the detailed recommendations will need to be adjusted\n\nto match the provisions of the new Act.  Some, but not all, of these management changes\n\ncan be introduced by Regulations.  There is, however, a need for change in the overall\n\nmanagement approach which is a matter of culture and depends ultimately on leadership\n\nfrom senior management in the TCDPO and the PMO.\n\n41\n\n\fThe major requirements are:\n\n#### o  A more pro-active management approach o  Adherence to strict time-tabling by all parties o  Holding Hearings in public o  Clarity and consistency in how Hearings or the Written Representations process\n\nare conducted\n\n#### o  Clarity and consistency in how site visits are conducted o  Early disclosure by all interested parties o  A focus on the issues in dispute, eg by establishing common ground o  Issuing any report prepared for the Minister to all parties involved o  Publication of all decisions with justification o  Training for all involved in the process.\n\n9)  Development Standards\n\nGiven the Minister’s overriding responsibility to secure consistency and continuity in the\n\nframing and execution of a comprehensive policy for the use and development of land, it\n\nis  customary  for  site  development  standards  –  with  respect  to  building  line  set-backs,\n\ncoverage, density, building heights, parking requirements, etc  -  to be set out either in\n\nstatutory instruments or in official policy documents. At present, various fixed standards\n\nare  prescribed  by  the  Development  Order  as  conditions  governing  permitted\n\ndevelopment.  These mandatory standards do not apply to developments in respect of\n\nwhich applications for planning permission are to be determined having regard to the\n\ndevelopment plan and other material considerations.\n\nIn  the  UK  the  practice  used  to  be  that  Planning  Guidance  Notes  (subsequently  called\n\nPlanning  Policy Statements) were issued by the Minister for the guidance of the Local\n\nPlanning Authorities determining applications. It is well established in the jurisprudence\n\non planning legislation that such published policies (in contrast to unpublished “desk-\n\ndrawer”  policies)  are  “material  considerations”  to  be  taken  into  account  in  the\n\ndetermination of applications. This does not mean that they are binding and the decision-\n\nmaker has the discretion to vary or waive  compliance with such standards where this\n\nappears to be merited.\n\nIn some other jurisdictions, for example under the Tasmanian  Land Use Planning and\n\nApprovals Act 1993, a more rigorous approach of issuing Planning Directives has been\n\nadopted. Before their adoption, such Planning Directives must be published in draft for\n\n42\n\n\fpublic comment – which may include a public hearing – and notice of the issuance of any\n\nsuch Directive by the Minister must be published in the Official Gazette. Upon adoption,\n\nsuch Planning Directives become binding on planning authorities.\n\nIn Barbados, there are some existing development standards set out in documents such\n\nas The Applicant’s Handbook and Guide to Town Planning, published by the TCPDO,\n\nand The Applicant’s Handbook and Guide to Coastal Planning in Barbados, published\n\nby the CZMU. These  would be legally  analogous to the published Planning  Guidance\n\nNotes/Planning Policy Statements in the UK.\n\nIt is recommended that -\n\n  The present practice of issuing policy documents which set out basic\n\ndevelopment standards be retained\n\n  However, such policy documents should be kept up to date and emanate from\n\nthe office of the Minister, who is responsible for consistency and continuity in the\n\nformulation of policies for the use and development of land.\n\n  Such policies should be published in draft for public comment before their\n\nadoption by the Minister\n\n  Notice should be given of the adoption of any such policy in the Official Gazette\n\n10)  Environmental Impact Assessments\n\nPrinciple 17 of the 1992 Rio Declaration on the Environment and Development declares\n\nthat  environmental  impact  assessments  (EIAs)  must  be  undertaken  for  proposed\n\nactivities which are likely to have an adverse effect on the environment and are subject\n\nto a decision of a competent national authority. This global undertaking was echoed in\n\nthe Declaration of Barbados and Programme of Action for Small Island Developing States\n\n(SIDS)  entered  into  at  the  1994  Global  Conference  on  the  Sustainable  Development  of\n\nSIDS. In keeping with these international commitments, the Town and Country Planning\n\nAct was amended in 1998 to make provision at s.17(1) for EIAs to be required by the CTP\n\nin support of applications for planning permission for development which is “likely to\n\nhave an effect on the environment of Barbados”.\n\nHence, it has become the practice of the CTP to require EIAs to be submitted by applicants\n\nin some instances. Some guidance with respect to the cases in which EIAs are required\n\nby the CTP, the Terms of Reference (TOR) for EIA studies and the EIA process, including\n\npublic  participation  requirements,  are  contained  in  the  Physical  Development  Plan\n\n43\n\n\f(Amended) 2003, approved by Parliament, and the Applicant’s Handbook and Guide to\n\nTown  Planning,  published  by  the  TCPDO  (which  is  out  of  print  and  not  available\n\nelectronically). However, these publications are both policy documents and to date a firm\n\nlegal framework for the EIA process is lacking. In this respect, as documented in a recent\n\nstudy of the legislative framework for EIA in the Caribbean carried out by the Caribbean\n\nLaw  Institute  under  the  Impact  Justice  Project,  Barbados  is  lagging  behind  other\n\nCommonwealth Caribbean countries.\n\nEIAs are  costly and time consuming  and  it  is essential that  there is transparency with\n\nrespect to the cases in which EIAs are required and the EIA process, including the process\n\nby which EIA reports are reviewed.\n\nIt is recommended that EIA Regulations should be made as a matter of urgency under\n\nthe new legislation. Such Regulations should provide clearly for –\n\n  The cases in which EIAs are or can be required;\n  The stage of the approval process at which EIAs (or different levels of EIA studies)\n\nare required\n\n  The preparation of the TORs for EIAs\n  The carrying out of EIAs, including the qualifications of EIA preparers\n  Public participation requirements\n  The essential elements of EIA reports\n  The mechanism for the review of EIA reports\n  The  incorporation  of  terms  and  conditions  with  respect  to  mitigation  and\n\nmonitoring measures into planning permission\n\n11)  Coastal and Seabed Developments\n\nGiven the definition of “land” in the existing law (which it is not suggested should be\n\namended)  planning  control  in  Barbados  extends  beyond  the  shoreline  to  the  seabed\n\nwithin the Territorial Waters of Barbados. This area of planning control is cross-cut by\n\nthe  coastal  zone  as  defined  by  the  Coastal  Zone  Management  Act,  CAP.394,  which\n\nprovides  inter  alia,  for  the  preparation  of  a  Coastal  Zone  Management  Plan  (CZMP)\n\ndefining  the  Coastal  Zone  Management  Area.  Part  II  of  the  Act  sets  out  the  statutory\n\nprocess for the preparation and approval of the CZMP, inclusive of the holding of a public\n\nenquiry on the draft CZMP, approval of the plan by the Minister and the establishment\n\nof the CZMP by Order published in the Official Gazette.\n\n44\n\n\fSeveral consequential amendments were made to the Town and Country Planning Act,\n\nCAP.240, upon enactment of the Coastal Zone Management Act in 1998. For example,\n\ns.15(1A) limits the power of the Minister to grant planning permission via a Development\n\nOrder  for  any  development  within  the  Coastal  Zone  Management  Area  which  is\n\nprohibited by the CZMP. Likewise s.17(1A) provides that the CTP must request an EIA\n\nwhere  proposed  development  is  in  a  Coastal  Zone  Management  Area.  None  of  these\n\nprovisions  have  come  into  effect  to  date  because  the  draft  CZMP,  which  has  been  in\n\nexistence for many years, has never been through the required process of public enquiry,\n\nMinisterial approval and publication of an Order in the Official Gazette.\n\nNevertheless, the CZMU now plays a pivotal role in the processing of applications for\n\nplanning  permission  for  coastal  development,  whether  such  applications  fall  to  be\n\ndecided  by  the  CTP  or  the  Minister.  Their  policies  are  set  out  in  a  publication,  The\n\nApplicant’s Handbook and Guide to Coastal Planning in Barbados, an electronic copy\n\nof which is available on their website. This document includes reference to the CZMP,\n\nwhich is not available in either electronic or print form, without acknowledgment of the\n\nfact that the plan is not an approved plan. In the Handbook the CZMU acknowledges\n\nthat  regulatory  jurisdiction  over  coastal  development  is  in  the  hands  of  the  planning\n\nauthorities;  however,  in  practice  the  CTP’s  decisions  and  advice  to  the  Minister  with\n\nrespect to coastal applications follow the CZMU’s advice, even with respect to matters\n\noutside of their area of technical competence.\n\nIt is recommended that –\n\n  The CZMU should be called upon to subject the draft CZMP – including the\n\ndelimitation  of  the  coastal  zone  -  to  the  statutory  processes  for  public\n\nconsultation and approval provided for by the CZM Act;\n\n  The  role  of  the  CZMU  in  decision-making  on  applications  for  planning\n\npermission within the coastal zone should be clarified;\n\n  Consideration  should  be  given  in  this  context  to  the  role  that  the  CZMU\n\nshould play with respect to applications for proposed developments on the\n\nseabed outside of the coastal zone.\n\n12)  Conservation of Built Heritage\n\nBarbados has a wealth of heritage assets which provides a very valuable heritage tourism\n\nproduct.  However, much of the built heritage is in poor condition and at risk of loss.  The\n\n45\n\n\fexisting legislation is weak and very limited and the penalties for non-compliance are so\n\nlow  that  they  provide  no  deterrent.    The  designation  of  the  UNESCO  World  Heritage\n\nstatus  for  Bridgetown  and  its  Historic  Garrison  recognises  the  importance  of  this  key\n\nasset, but does not provide the protection or tools to maximise its potential.\n\nSections  28,  29  and  30  of  the  Act  contain  the  existing  provisions  for  making  Building\n\nPreservation Orders (s.28), compiling a list of buildings of special architectural or historic\n\ninterest (s.29) and requires the owner of a listed building to give the CTP at least 2 months\n\nnotice of any proposal to carry out works to demolish or alter/extend a listed building\n\n(s.30).\n\nAlthough the provisions of the Building Preservation Order are stronger  - in that they\n\nrequire consent for work to a historic building  - they involve the service of individual\n\nnotices,  which  is  time  consuming  and  the  provisions  are  rarely  used.    The  Listed\n\nBuildings  list  is  not  comprehensive  and  needs  updating  and  there  are  no  provisions\n\nwithin the legislation for designation of heritage conservation areas.\n\nIn many other jurisdictions the demolition, alteration or extension to a listed building is\n\nconsidered  to  be  development  and  requires  either  planning  consent  or  specific  listed\n\nbuilding consent.  The Barbados National Trust has expressed a strong preference for the\n\nstatus for Listed Buildings to be strengthened and for control of demolition to be included\n\nin the definition of development.  If this is done, the existing provisions for the Building\n\nPreservation Order are no longer required.  An applicant would have to apply for consent\n\nfor planning permission for demolition or alteration of a listed building and would have\n\nthe  same  rights  of  appeal  as  any  other  applicant  if  they  were  not  satisfied  with  the\n\ndecision or conditions attached.\n\nThere is clearly a need to update and review the list. The existing Act makes provision\n\nfor this to be done by either the Minister or the Barbados National Trust or other persons\n\nor bodies.  The review of the list should be an open and consultative process and notices\n\nshould be served on the owners of properties.  The CTP has expressed the view that it\n\nshould  also  be  possible  to  list  part  of  a  building  or  features  of  special  architectural  or\n\nhistoric interest and not only the entire building.\n\nThere is also no provision in the Barbados legislation to deal with the protection of the\n\ncharacter of historic areas and to designate heritage conservation areas.  The revised PDP\n\n46\n\n\fidentifies a number of historic areas, but there are no specific powers in the legislation to\n\ndeal with formal designation of such areas or provisions to protect their character.\n\nSection 2.2.5 of the PDP - Cultural Heritage is very comprehensive.  It identifies how the\n\nPublic Register of Historic Places will be prepared, updated with provisions for public\n\nparticipation.  It also specifically identifies 6 designated Cultural Heritage Conservation\n\nAreas:\n\n1.  Historic Bridgetown and its Garrison\n2.  Strathclyde\n3.  Belleville\n4.  Hastings Pavilion/Ocean View\n5.  Speightstown\n6.  Rock Hall\n\nThe  PDP  recommends  strict  controls  of  development\n\n(including\n\ntrees  and\n\nadvertisements)  not  only  within  the  World  Heritage  site  and  Heritage  Conservation\n\nAreas  but  adjacent  to  them.    There  is  also  a  requirement  for  a  Heritage  Impact\n\nAssessment.    However,  as  under  the  existing  legislation  the  Plan  is  merely  a  material\n\nconsideration  it  is  unclear  what  legal  status  these  provisions  have.  There  is  also  a\n\nrecommendation  of  a  fine  of  up  to  $50,000  for  unauthorised  interventions  and\n\ndemolitions.\n\nGiven  the  importance  of  our  heritage  asset  it  is  important  that  it  is  afforded  greater\n\nprotection within the new legislation.\n\nIt is recommended that -\n\n  The definition of development be extended to include demolition works\n  Provisions for making, updating and making public the register of listed buildings\n\nbe strengthened and be made more transparent\n\n  Provisions  are  made  for  the  formal  designation  of  heritage  conservation  areas\n\nincluding the World Heritage Site\n\n  Provisions  are  also  made  for  control  of  development  within  and  adjoining\n\nconservation  areas  and  the  requirement  for  a  Heritage  Impact  Assessment  is\n\nclarified\n\n  The penalties for altering or demolishing a listed building are included as part of\n\nthe more comprehensive schedule of penalties.\n\n47\n\n\f  Consideration  be  given  to  having  a  sub-committee  of  the  Sustainable\n\nDevelopment Board to advise the Board on design and conservation of the built\n\nheritage.\n\n13)  Urban Design\n\nIncreasingly  the  issue  of  urban  design  is  seen  as  an  important  consideration  in  the\n\nplanning process and in place making.  Good urban design is about more than individual\n\nbuildings, it is about the relationship between buildings and the spaces between them.\n\nThe current planning system in Barbados has little emphasis on design at the national\n\nphysical planning level which is more of a strategic approach to the overall development\n\nof the island.  At this scale, there are blanket policy guidelines for density and in some\n\nareas heights, as well as road reserves and building lines and set backs. The current five\n\nstorey  limit  for  beach  front  development  has  led  to  a  monotonous  uniformity  and\n\nprovided little scope for innovative design.\n\nThis approach has been taken in the context of a very discretionary legislative framework\n\nwhich  allows  the  TCDPO  to  use  professional  judgements  to  impose  site-specific\n\nguidance. This discretionary approach has not always had sustainable design outcomes.\n\nIn  the  recently  revised  Barbados  Physical  Development  Plan,  at  the  more  detailed\n\nphysical  plan  levels  such  as  community  planning,  there  are  policies  which  set  out  an\n\napproach to design which considers issues such as vernacular style, sustainable building\n\ndesign and height and massing of new buildings.  There is increasing pressure for high\n\nbuildings and  in the community plans the Barbados Physical Development Plan Draft\n\n2017, there is direction on where it would be appropriate to have them based on current\n\nconditions.    Integrating high buildings into sensitive historic environments is a challenge\n\nfaced  by  many  cities.    Those  who  have  been  successful  at  integrating  modern\n\ndevelopment into the historic fabric have usually had clear policies on how this should\n\nbe done.\n\nIn  Barbados  it  is  important  that  we  continue  to  understand  the  development  and\n\neconomic  pressures  which  drive  modern  development  and  the  needs  to  balance  this\n\nagainst the need to preserve our heritage and the character that makes Barbados unique.\n\nThere is no blanket height policy that will fit every section of a development precinct as\n\nthe overall purpose, functionality, aesthetics and amenity of the area must be considered.\n\n48\n\n\fIt is recommended that the extensive urban design policies developed as part of the work\n\nof the Barbados Physical Development Plan Draft 2017 and presented within the context\n\nof nine community plans, be revisited as required, and extended to include other critical\n\ndevelopment  zones  in  order  to  develop  further  guidance/standards  appropriate  to\n\nBarbados.  These could take the form of Supplementary Planning Documents as part of\n\nthe  Development  Planning  Process  and/or  through  planning  directives.    The  new  act\n\nshould make provision for this by allowing such Supplementary Planning Documents to\n\nbe adopted as part of the Physical Development Plan.\n\n14)  Derelict and Vacant Buildings and Land\n\nIn planning for the orderly use of land it is important to ensure that land is used for its\n\nintended purpose.  Barbados has a limited supply of land but there are large numbers of\n\nbuildings which are vacant and derelict and subdivisions where lots remain vacant for\n\ndecades.  This is a very inefficient use of resources. Vacant lots need to be serviced and\n\nthe  infrastructure  and  utilities  maintained.    Long  term  vacancies  lead  to  dereliction,\n\ndamage the amenity of the neighbourhood and can also be a health hazard. The presence\n\nof  derelict  buildings  (both  residential  and  commercial)  has  a  negative  impact  on  the\n\nappearance of the island. Vacant lots that are not maintained become overrun by bush,\n\ncow-itch and vermin and have a detrimental effect on residential subdivisions.\n\nWhat  is required is a  strategy to bring  these wasted resources back into use.  In other\n\njurisdictions the development and use of proactive Empty Property Strategies have had\n\nreal  success.    These  work  on  the  basis  of  actively  encouraging  owners  to  bring  the\n\nproperties back to use but as a last resort can use compulsory powers to acquire or force\n\nthe sale of the property.  Tools need to be put in place to facilitate this work although the\n\nthreat of compulsory action is often sufficient to bring about change.\n\nIt is recommended that\n\n  Consideration  is  given  to  developing  and  implementing  an  Empty  Property\n\nStrategy\n\n  Provision is made for the use of compulsory powers where necessary to support\n\nthis strategy.\n\n49\n\n\f15)  Tree Preservation\n\nSection 27 of the Act contains provisions for the making of Tree Preservation Orders to\n\nprotect  trees,  groups  of  trees  and  woodlands  in  the  interests  of  amenity  or  of  soil\n\nconservation. The section sets out the particulars to be included in and the procedure for\n\nmaking of such orders, inclusive of publication of a notice of intention to make any such\n\norder and the consideration of objections and representations, before the Order can be\n\nmade. No such Orders have ever been made, but in 1981 separate legislation, the Trees\n\n(Preservation) Act, CAP. 397, was adopted without any amendment having been made\n\nto the provisions of section 27.\n\nUnder  this  legislation  a  person  who  wished  to  kill  a  tree  the  circumference  of  which\n\nexceeds one metre at a point half a metre from the ground, except a tree that poses an\n\nimminent danger or is required to be removed under other legislation, must apply to the\n\nCTP for permission. The CTP is allowed 28 days to approve such applications. The effect\n\nof these provisions was to reverse the obligation imposed on the Minister by s.27 of the\n\nAct  to take proactive measures for tree  preservation and impose an obligation to seek\n\napproval  upon  persons  wishing  to  fell  trees  to  which  the  Act  applies.  It  offers  no\n\nprotection  to  important  species  such  as  palms  and  mangroves,  which  do  not  attain  a\n\nmetre in girth. However, the Act also contains an important provision which vests the\n\nCTP with additional powers to require the owners of land to plant trees on vacant land,\n\nor land abutting a public road, or land on which a new road is to be built (e.g. within\n\nsubdivisions). This is backed up by a provision whereby the CTP may require a developer\n\nto  deposit  a  sum  of  money  in  the  Treasury  as  security  for  implementing  landscaping\n\nconditions of planning permission.\n\nTree preservation orders are potentially useful in preserving the amenity of conservation\n\nareas and other sensitive areas, but the provisions of these two Acts need to be reconciled.\n\nIt is recommended that -\n\na)  The tree preservation order provisions be retained in the new Act\nb)  The  Trees (Preservation) Act be repealed and its provisions  incorporated in the\n\nnew Town and Country Planning Act\n\nc)  A more appropriate definition of “tree” be used in the new legislation\n\n50\n\n\fd)  All  powers  and  duties  assigned  to  the  Minister  under  these  provisions  be\n\ntransferred to the Sustainable Development Board if one is established.\n\n#### C.  Planning Obligations\n\nThe concept of planning obligations (sometimes referred to as contributions or planning\n\ngain) was introduced into Barbados planning law  by the Town and Country Planning\n\n(Amendment)  Act,  Act  No.  51  of  2007,  which  inserted  a  new  part,  Part  IVA,  into  the\n\nexisting  law.  As drafted,  s.32F, which provides for agreements between applicants for\n\nplanning  permission  and  the  Crown  with  respect  to  planning  obligations,  relates\n\nspecifically to the provision of affordable housing. In other countries planning obligations\n\ncan extend to other elements of physical and social infrastructure and to environmental\n\nenhancements.  Even  in its limited form, s.32F has not been used because  Regulations\n\nwith respect to planning obligations have not yet been made pursuant to s.32H.\n\nPlanning  obligations  are  usually  connected  to  the  grant  of  planning  permission  and  it\n\nmay  be  a  condition  of  planning  permission  that  a  developer  enters  into  a  planning\n\nobligations  agreement.    Planning  obligations  resemble  planning  conditions  but  can\n\nachieve planning objects that cannot be achieved by planning conditions.  For instance,\n\nplanning obligations can fund off-site infrastructure.  Developers may agree to carry out\n\nspecified works themselves or pay a commuted sum equivalent to the agreed cost of the\n\nworks.  In the UK there is also a Community Infrastructure Levy which is a tariff-based\n\napproach to collecting the contribution.\n\nThe criticism often levelled at planning obligations is that they can equate to the buying\n\nand  selling  of  planning  permissions.    Policy  in  Britain  addresses  this  by  requiring\n\nplanning obligations to assist in mitigating the impact of unacceptable development and\n\nmake it acceptable in planning terms.  Planning obligations may only constitute a reason\n\nfor  granting  permission  if  they  meet  the  tests  that  they  are  necessary  to  make  the\n\ndevelopment  acceptable  in  planning  terms,  directly  related  to  the  development,  and\n\nfairly and reasonably related in scale and kind.  This policy is incorporated in Regulations\n\nand  is  based  on  case  law.    Local  planning  authorities  are  expected  to  include  their\n\nplanning  obligations  policies  in  development  plans  and  keep  details  of  all  planning\n\nobligations agreements and their discharge in the planning register.\n\n51\n\n\fPlanning obligations could be used in Barbados to fund a range of physical, social and\n\nenvironmental requirements, including for instance:\n\n#### o  Affordable housing – either on-site as part of a large development or elsewhere\n\nfollowing a contribution on a tariff basis\n\n#### o  Junction and other highways improvements linked to traffic generation by a new\n\ndevelopment\n\n#### o  New  or  enhanced  public  beach  access  and  facilities  related  to  beachfront\n\ndevelopment\n\n#### o  Boardwalk extensions related to beachfront development o  Additional class rooms or school facilities related to new residential development o  Environmental mitigation measures during construction and after completion of\n\na development.\n\nIt  is  recommended  that  the  new  planning  legislation  contains  broader  measures  for\n\nplanning obligations.\n\n#### D.  Limitation Periods\n\nThe existing law specifies certain deadlines by which various steps should be taken  by\n\nthe CTP and others with respect to the administration and enforcement of the Act. As\n\nregards  the  processing  of  applications,  the  law  provides  that  the  CTP  must  make  a\n\ndecision on an application within 2 calendar months of submission. Within this period\n\nthe CTP may allow agencies with which statutory consultations must be carried out 14 to\n\n21  days  to  comment  on  the  application.  These  deadlines  are  never  met.  Due  to  an\n\namendment made to the Act in 1981, the CTP no longer has to ask the applicant to agree\n\nto an extension of the time limit for determination of the application. The only recourse\n\nthat the applicant has is to appeal to the Minister pursuant to section 20 of the Act, on the\n\ngrounds that the application is deemed to have been refused after the elapse of 2 months.\n\nThis is never done as there are no deadlines for the processing of appeals to the Minister,\n\nwhich may take even longer to be determined.\n\nThis  is  an  area  where  we  can  learn  from  experience  elsewhere.    In  the  UK  poor\n\nperformance by Local Planning Authorities led to a major review in the 1990s and targets\n\nwere  set  and  monitored  with  the  results  published  in  a  league  table.  Penalties  and\n\nrewards  were  applied  to  influence  performance.    This  resulted  in  an  improvement  in\n\n52\n\n\fperformance.  The current English standards included in the 2015 General Development\n\nOrder  are  8  weeks  for  a  simple  application,  13  weeks  for  major  developments  and  16\n\nweeks where an application is subject to an EIA.  There is also a non-statutory “planning\n\nguarantee” reflecting Government policy that no application should spend more than a\n\nyear with decision-makers, including any appeal.\n\nIt is absolutely essential to efficiency of the regulatory process that the relevant authority\n\nhas deadlines for processing  applications, that such deadlines  be realistic and that  the\n\napplicant has meaningful recourse if they are not met.  It is clear that large applications\n\nare much more complex now than they were in the 1960s when the original 2 months\n\ntime  limit  was  set  and  this  should  be  reflected  in  the  proposed  deadlines.    The\n\nintroduction  of  the  new  Sustainable  Development  Board  will  also  require  that\n\napplications are processed in line with its meeting cycles.\n\nIt is recommended that –\n\n  The  deadlines  of  2  months  for  the  determination  of  applications  should  be\n\nreplaced by a tiered system of 8 weeks for simple developments, 13 weeks for\n\nmajor developments and 16 weeks if an EIA is required.\n\n  The running of time for this limitation period should start from the time when\n\nthe applicant has submitted a completed application, inclusive of an EIA and any\n\nother additional information (when required)\n\n  The deadline of 14 to 21 days for the receipt of comments from referral agencies\n\nshould be retained\n\n  The  relevant  authority  should  have  to  get  the  applicant’s  agreement  to  any\n\nextension of this deadline for decision-making\n\n  Either the application should be deemed approved at the expiry of the limitation\n\nperiod or the applicant should have meaningful recourse against the delay.  Such\n\nrecourse could take the form of an appeal to the Appeal Tribunal\n\n  Where  it  is  clear  at  the  outset  that  an  extended  period  would  be  necessary  to\n\nprocess an application, the CTP and the applicant should consider entering into\n\na planning performance agreement before the application is submitted.\n\n53\n\n\fE.  Enforcement\n\nUnder the existing legislation there is a suite of measures that can be taken by the CTP to\n\nenforce compliance with planning control. However, the CTP must initiate enforcement\n\nproceedings within 4 years of the unauthorized development having been carried out.\n\nWhere  development  is  carried  out  without  planning  permission  or  in  breach  of  the\n\nconditions subject to which such permission was granted, the CTP may serve the owner\n\nand occupier of the land with an Enforcement Notice setting out the breach of planning\n\ncontrol committed and the steps the developer must take to remedy the breach. Where\n\nthe development consists of or includes the carrying out of building or other operations,\n\nthe CTP may also serve a Stop Notice requiring works for the development cited in the\n\nEnforcement  Notice  to  cease  immediately.  If  the  developer  fails  to  comply  with  the\n\nEnforcement Notice within the specified time, the CTP may enter upon the land and take\n\nthe steps required by the Notice and recover the cost of doing so from the owner of the\n\nland. The person served may also be prosecuted and fined for non-compliance with an\n\nEnforcement  Notice  or  a  Stop  Notice.  Enforcement  notices  are  subject  to  the  strict\n\ninterpretation standards applicable  in the criminal law because  they may lead to such\n\nconvictions and penalties.\n\nThe options open to a person served with an Enforcement Notice are to comply with the\n\nnotice; to appeal to a Judge in Chambers against the notice on any of several grounds\n\nspecified in the Act; to challenge the validity of the notice by way of a defence to summary\n\nproceedings  in  the  Magistrate’s  Court  for  breach  of  the  notice;  or  by  way  of  Judicial\n\nReview proceedings in the High Court on grounds other than those which could have\n\nbeen raised on an appeal to a Judge in Chambers. There is no means of challenging a Stop\n\nNotice short of Judicial Review proceedings in the High Court. In the event that a Stop\n\nNotice or the Enforcement Notice on which it is based is held to be invalid, the Crown is\n\nliable for the losses incurred by the developer arising from the stoppage of works.\n\nThe major issues arising with respect to these provisions of the existing law are that the\n\nCTP has the discretion as to whether to take enforcement action in any instance and the\n\ncourts will not enquire into how this discretion has been exercised. This is a source of\n\nconcern as to whether it is being exercised fairly. Secondly, the CTP is in the practice of\n\ninitiating  demolition  action  after  the  expiry  of  the  time  limit  for  compliance  with\n\nEnforcement  Notices  without  having  vindicated  such  notices  by  prosecution  of  the\n\ndeveloper in the Magistrate’s Court. This is inadvisable as, if the Notice is proved to be\n\n54\n\n\finvalid in Judicial Review proceedings the Crown would be liable to pay the developer\n\ncompensation,  which  may  be  appreciable  particularly  if  a  Stop  Notice  has  also  been\n\nserved.  Thirdly,  the  existing  fines  for  breaches  of  Enforcement  and  Stop  Notices  are\n\ntrivial.\n\nParticipants  in  the  stakeholder  consultations  supported  the  retention  of  the  4  year\n\nlimitation  period  for  the  initiation  of  enforcement  proceedings  in  Barbados;  however,\n\nthey opined that there should be transparency with respect to how the CTP exercises the\n\ndiscretion to take such proceedings, so that complainants can find out what is being done\n\nand,  if  no  enforcement  action  is  taken,  the  reasons  why.  It  was  also  agreed  that\n\nenforcement powers need to be exercised with greater care, having regard to the liability\n\nfor the Crown which may result where it is proved that Enforcement Notices are flawed\n\nor have not been served in the correct manner. The lack of a public register of enforcement\n\nactions  was  also  identified  as  a  problem,  which  gives  rise  to  the  present  practice  of\n\nrequesting certificates of compliance as part of conveyancing practice.\n\nIt is recommended that –\n\n  The 4 year limitation period should be retained\n  The  relevant  authority  should  have  to  succeed  in  a  prosecution  based  on  an\n\nEnforcement Notice before exercising the power of demolition\n\n  The  grounds  on  which  an  Enforcement  Notice  can  be  appealed  to  a  Judge  in\n\nChambers should not be limited\n\n  Provision should be made for appeal against Stop Notices, to avoid the necessity,\n\ncosts and delays associated with Judicial Review proceedings\n\n  Enforcement and Stop Notices should  be prepared and served by persons with\n\nadequate training in legal requirements and procedures\n\n  The CTP should keep a publicly accessible register of Enforcement Action which\n\nshould be available on-line\n\n  The CTP should report to the Sustainable Development Board on complaints of\n\nbreaches and enforcement action taken.\n\n55\n\n\fF.  Administrative Fees & Penalties\n\na)  Administrative Fees\n\nThe Town and Country Planning (Fees) Regulations 1970 (S.I. 1970 No 181) introduced\n\nthe concept of charging of fees for planning applications and set fee levels.  The scale of\n\nfees remained in place for 23 years until amended by the Town and Country Planning\n\n(Fees) (Amendment) Regulations 2009.  That fee scale has been unchanged for the last 9\n\nyears.\n\nThe concept of charging fees to cover the administrative cost of processing applications\n\nis  well  established.    The  scale  of  fees  charged  should  reflect  the  cost  of  delivering  the\n\nfunction but also should be proportionate to the scale and nature of the development.\n\nThe  existing  structure  seeks  to  do  this  by  making  some  charges  related  to  the  square\n\nfootage of the development.  The charge for a chattel house has remained for some time\n\nat the nominal $10 limit.  However, a residential property of 2,000 sq. ft. would pay the\n\nsame fees as a 30,000 sq. ft. luxury villa.   There might be a need to make adjustments to\n\nthresholds and categories to respond to changing circumstances.\n\nThe fees for retrospective applications are double that of an application made in advance\n\nof development. At present there are no fees applied to hearings for appeals and referrals\n\nto the Minister to cover the additional cost of the hearing.\n\nIncreasingly developers are requiring pre-application discussions on large and complex\n\nprojects.  This is an important aspect of the facilitation role that the planning department\n\nis expected to play.  It can be non-productive if such  work is speculative and does not\n\nresult in an application.  It would be possible to charge for this activity in advance of an\n\napplication and deduct the cost from the final fee.\n\nIt is important that fee structures should be kept up to date and reviewed.  This would\n\nenable inflation in costs to be accommodated, but would also allow for consideration to\n\nbe given to changes in circumstances which will occur from time to time.  For example,\n\nthe 2009 revision introduced a new class for marinas to reflect the expensive nature of the\n\ntechnical assessments required for that type development.\n\nIt is recommended that a new schedule of fees should be prepared and once approved\n\nshould  be  reviewed  annually  by  the  Sustainable  Development  Board  and  changes  (if\n\nnecessary) recommended to the Minister for approval.\n\n56\n\n\fb)  Penalties and Fines\n\nSimilarly  out  of  date  are  the  penalties  and  fines  for  breaches  in  planning  regulations.\n\nThese have not been updated since the original legislation and are so low that they do\n\nnot have any deterrent value.  For example, the fine for demolishing a Listed Building is\n\na  mere  $500  while  non-compliance  with  Enforcement  Orders  only  results  in  fines  of\n\n$1,000 plus daily charges.\n\nA review should be made of all existing penalties, including fines, to bring them in line\n\nwith  other  similar  offences  and  where  fines  are  the  penalty  they  should  regularly  be\n\nupdated to take into account inflation and changing attitudes to the offence.  This review\n\ncould also be undertaken by the Sustainable Development Board and recommendations\n\nfor change made as appropriate.  In addition, some form of inflation measure could be\n\nautomatically applied annually to the fine component of penalties.  While this would not\n\ndeal with the deterrent value of the penalty, it would ensure that once set they do not\n\nbecome obsolete over time, as has happened with the current system.\n\n#### G.  Appeals\n\nAs with planning applications referred to the Minister for decision (discussed in section\n\n4.B.8 above), current arrangements for dealing with appeals against decisions taken by\n\nthe CTP are much criticised for contributing to delay. The current arrangements are also\n\nlacking in openness and transparency with little regard for rules of natural justice and\n\nthe  process  is  not  well  managed.  Staff  in  the  TCPDO  and  PMO  perform  in  a  reactive\n\nrather than pro-active manner and there are no performance targets or deadlines.\n\nSection 19 of the Act provides for an applicant who is aggrieved by the decision made by\n\nthe  CTP,  either  to  refuse  planning  permission  or  against  conditions  subject  to  which\n\nplanning permission is granted, to request the CTP to refer the decision for review by the\n\nMinister. Additionally, s.20 extends the right to appeal to the Minister under s.19 to cases\n\nin which the CTP has failed to determine an application within the two-month limitation\n\nperiod set by  s.20(1) and Regulation 7.  However, as the appeal route  is no  faster than\n\nwaiting for a decision from the CTP, it is almost unknown for applicants to invoke their\n\nright to appeal under s.20.\n\n57\n\n\fThe provisions of the  existing  legislation regarding  the procedure to be followed with\n\nrespect to appeals to the Minister are vague, inadequate and have allowed for the lack of\n\na time-bound, fair and transparent appellate procedure to be followed.\n\nRegulation 9(1) provides that the applicant must make the request in writing with 28 days\n\nreceipt of the decision, stating the grounds of appeal; however, as regards the deadlines\n\nfor  action  by  the  CTP,  s.19(3)  of  the  Act  provides  only  that,  when  such  a  request  is\n\nreceived,  the  CTP  must  refer  it  to  the  Minister  with  “all  reasonable  dispatch”  and\n\nRegulation  9(3)  provides  that  the  CTP  must  furnish  the  Minister  with  copies  of  the\n\nrelevant  documents,  including  a  statement  of  his/her  observations  on  the  request,  “as\n\nsoon  as  practicable”.  Section  19(6)  provides  that,  if  either  the  applicant  or  the  CTP  so\n\ndesire, the Minister permit them to having a hearing before a person appointed by the\n\nMinister for that purpose. There are no provisions in the Act or Regulations governing\n\nthe qualifications for the appointment of persons to conduct hearings or the procedures\n\nfor  the  conduct  of  such  hearings,  reporting  by  the  person  conducting  the  hearing  or\n\ndecision-making  by the  Minister. Further, under  s.19(9), the Minister  is only bound to\n\ngive a statement of reasons for his/her decision if expressly requested by the applicant.\n\nHence, the existing law and practice does not conform to basic rules of natural justice.\n\nThere is no urgency on the part of the CTP with regard to the referral of appeals to the\n\nMinister, the delay being attributed to the necessity to prepare the CTP’s memorandum\n\nwith respect to the application, for which there is no deadline. Section 19 hearings are not\n\nopen to the public, there are no  settled rules of procedure; there is no regular way for\n\nthird parties to intervene; there is no two-way disclosure of documents in advance; and\n\nthe  report  of  the  person  conducting  the  hearing  is  not  made  available  to  either  the\n\nappellant or the CTP. As with applications referred to the Minister under s.18, there have\n\nbeen criticisms of the selection and performance of persons appointed to conduct appeal\n\nhearings.\n\nThe  current  Act  is  unclear  as  to  whether  it  provides  for  appeals  by  written\n\nrepresentations.  S.19(6) says that the Minister will appoint someone to conduct a hearing\n\nif either the appellant or CTP wishes.  However, it gives no guidance on how the Minister\n\nshould proceed if neither of them expresses that desire.  It is presumed that the Minister\n\nwould  proceed  using  the  information  mentioned  in  the  1972  Regulations:    Para  9(2)\n\nrequires that any request for review of a decision by the CTP “shall be in writing and\n\n58\n\n\fshall state the precise grounds on which the request is based” and  Para 9(3) asks the CTP\n\nto provide the file and a statement containing his/her observations on the request.  The\n\nMinister would effectively determine the appeal on the basis of written representations.\n\nThis  position  is  unsatisfactory  and  probably  explains  to  a  large  extent  why  few  or  no\n\nappeals are decided by written representations.  There may also be a feeling on the part\n\nof applicants and appellants that with a planning system which is closed and opaque, the\n\nHearing  is  the  one  opportunity  to  have  their  say.    In  England  and  Wales  there  are\n\nsignificant time savings with written representations and a large proportion of appeals\n\nfollow  this  route.    In  Bermuda,  where  applicants  can  attend  and  speak  at  the\n\nDevelopment Applications Board when their applications are first considered, the vast\n\nmajority of appeals are by written representations.  It is possible that in future there will\n\nbe more interest in using written representations in Barbados if it is quicker, less costly,\n\nand  if  applicants  have  more  confidence  in  the  planning  system  generally.    It  is\n\nrecommended that the new Act includes provision for appeals by written representations\n\nand that the Regulations are drafted accordingly.\n\nThese flaws in the existing appellate process expose the Minister to potential litigation.\n\nAlthough s.19(8) of the Act provides that the decision of the Minister on appeals is final,\n\nsuch decisions are susceptible to review by the High Count pursuant to s.72 of the Act,\n\non  the  limited  grounds  that  they  are  not  within  the  powers  of  the  Act,  and  on  all  the\n\ngrounds applicable to administrative decisions generally pursuant to the Administrative\n\nJustice Act, CAP.109B, s.16(1)(b).\n\nThe objective of the appeal process should be to provide a system which is both efficient\n\nand at the same time fair, impartial, transparent and independent with no party being at\n\na  disadvantage  and  with  the  rules  of  natural  justice  complied  with.    In  deciding  on  a\n\nframework for the future it is necessary to consider two main elements – governance and\n\nmanagement.  Governance arrangements will be established by the new Act while the\n\nmanagement  issues  will  be  addressed  partly  by  Regulations  and  partly  by  improved\n\nmanagement practices and training.\n\nIn relation to appeals it is necessary to consider whether the Minister should be involved\n\nin  making  the  final  decision.    It  is  arguable  that  all  matters  of  strategic  national\n\nimportance – and which should therefore be considered by the Minister – will have been\n\n59\n\n\fsubmitted  for  determination  by  the  Minister  through  the  referral  process  (see  section\n\n4.B.8  above).  Another  factor  to  consider  must  be  the  extent  to  which  the  Minister’s\n\nvaluable time would be well spent considering minor appeals and where the Minister’s\n\ninvolvement could contribute to further delay for the appellant.\n\nPractice varies in other jurisdictions.  In Bermuda and Jamaica, like Barbados, the final\n\ndecision on all appeals (including written representations cases) is actually made by the\n\nMinister.  In  Britain,  there  is  a  right  of  appeal  to  the  Minister  but  the  vast  majority  of\n\nappeal decisions are made by the professional Planning Inspectorate, although there is a\n\nprovision for the Minister to “recover” an appeal and make the decision. In The Bahamas\n\nand  other  Commonwealth  Caribbean  jurisdictions,  including  the  British  Overseas\n\nTerritories as well as the OECS member countries,  appeals are decided by an Appeals\n\nTribunal. Under the recent legislation in Trinidad & Tobago, appeals against planning\n\ndecisions  lie  to  the  same  special  court,  the  Environmental  Commission,  established  to\n\nhear appeals under the environmental legislation.\n\nHence, as alternatives to the current arrangement, two governance options are suggested:\n\n1.  Professional Inspectorate\n\nThis  is  the  approach  adopted  for  instance  in  the  UK  and  in  the  much  smaller\n\nterritory of Bermuda.  In the UK the Planning Inspectorate is an executive agency\n\nof  Government  with  professional  inspectors  deciding  the  bulk  of  appeals\n\nthemselves  and  making  recommendations  to  the  Secretary  of  State  on  major\n\nprojects.  In Bermuda, an independent Inspector (currently one from Canada and\n\none from Barbados) visits the island periodically to conduct site visits and hearings\n\nbefore making recommendations to the Minister.  This arrangement achieves the\n\nobjective of independence in a territory where the population is one quarter that\n\nof Barbados.\n\n2.  Planning Appeals Tribunal\n\nThis is the approach which has been adopted in the majority of Commonwealth\n\nCaribbean  countries.  The  law  provides  for  the  Minister  to  appoint  suitably\n\nqualified persons to be members of the Appeals Tribunal. In some cases, provision\n\nis  made  for  a  larger  number  of  persons  to  be  appointed  to  a  panel  from  which\n\nAppeals  Tribunals  are  appointed  on  a  case  by  case  basis,  to  avoid  potential\n\n60\n\n\fconflicts of interest and/or the Appeals Tribunal becoming overloaded or a centre\n\nof  undue  influence.  The  persons  on  the  panel  should  all  be  qualified  and  have\n\nrelevant experience in planning, architecture, engineering, surveying, law or other\n\nrelated land use or relevant profession.  Nominations could be put forward by the\n\nrelevant professional bodies for approval by the Minister.  After hearing a case or\n\nconsidering written representations the Appeals Tribunal would issue its decision.\n\nThe Tribunal could also heard appeals from administrative decisions made under\n\nlegislation other than the planning law, that are related to land development.\n\nIn deciding between these options the issue of costs is relevant.  There is not the work\n\nvolume to justify a full-time Inspectorate but it would be possible to purchase time from\n\nqualified consultants.  The Bermuda model of using Inspectors from overseas brings the\n\nadditional  costs  of  travel  and  accommodation.    Tribunal  members  would  also  need\n\nremuneration and, whatever model is adopted, there will be servicing costs.  Whether a\n\nprofessional Inspector or a Planning Tribunal is adopted, there must be strict provisions\n\nwith regard to conflicts of interest.\n\nThe recommended approach is that of an Appeals Tribunal.  Having three persons make\n\na  decision  reduces  both  the  possibility  of  corruption  and  the  suspicion  of  corruption,\n\nespecially  if  the  three  persons  are  selected  at  random  from  amongst  a  large  panel  of\n\nqualified persons. The Tribunal’s decisions would be final on the planning merits of the\n\ncase and the only challenge through the courts would be on points of law.\n\n### 5.  Cross-cutting Issues\n\n#### A.  Public Participation\n\nAs acknowledged by the global community in Principle 10 of the 1992 Rio Declaration on\n\nEnvironment  and  Development,  environmental  issues  are  best  handled  with  citizens’\n\nparticipation, including the opportunity to participate in decision-making processes. This\n\nwas echoed, with specific reference to human settlements and shelter development, in\n\nthe 1996 Istanbul Declaration and Habitat Agenda, Chapter III.C and IV.D.3. Barbados\n\nsubscribed to both international instruments; however the existing planning legislation\n\ndoes not reflect these principles.\n\n61\n\n\fThe 2017 draft revision of the Physical Development Plan marked a major step forward\n\nin public participation in the planning process in Barbados.  By introducing a stage of\n\nparticipation on the draft plan before its formal submission the Minister, the CTP and the\n\nconsultancy team actually went further than is required by the existing law.  Early in the\n\nplan preparation process there was a stakeholder event organized in conjunction with the\n\nBarbados Town Planning Society, the draft document was made available for comment\n\non-line, and there were a number of town hall meetings at different locations.\n\nUnfortunately,  this  level  of  involvement  does  not  apply  to  the  development  control\n\nprocess.  In practice, the only requirement is to hold town hall meetings on completion of\n\nan EIA.  Following the decision of the High Court in the case of Archer & Others v Chief\n\nTown  Planner  &  Attorney  General,  No.1367  of  2008,  Judgment  of  Cornelius  J.,  18th\n\nNovember 2014, it is now custom and practice to consult neighbours when there is an\n\napplication for a change of use in a residential neighbourhood.  In the absence of readily\n\navailable information on planning applications submitted, there is little opportunity for\n\nthird parties to comment on proposals that affect them individually or have an impact on\n\nthe public at large.  This situation is unsatisfactory.\n\nIt  is  recommended  that  the  following  improvements  should  be  introduced  and\n\nincorporated in the new Act:\n\ni.  The  good  practice  shown  in  preparation  of  the  2017  draft  revision  of  the  PDP\n\nshould be reaffirmed;\n\nii.  Applicants should be required to post a notice on site prior to the submission of a\n\nplanning application and certify that they have done so;\n\niii.  The CTP should publish on-line and by email to the press meaningful information\n\non all applications received;\n\niv.  Third  party  comments  should  be  regarded  as  being  capable  of  being  material\n\nconsiderations in the evaluation of planning applications;\n\nv.  Third party persons who have submitted comments or objections should have the\n\nopportunity  to  submit  evidence  and  speak  briefly  at  Sustainable  Development\n\nBoard meetings;\n\nvi.  Third party persons who  have previously submitted comments or  objections to\n\nthe  SDB  should  also  have  the  opportunity  to  appear  at  the  Planning  Appeals\n\nTribunal;\n\n62\n\n\fvii.  Third party persons who have submitted comments or objections should similarly\n\nbe able to appear at a Hearing convened to consider an application referred to the\n\nMinister.\n\n#### B.  Access to Information\n\nAccess  to  information  is  a  vital  element  of  building  confidence  in  the  town  planning\n\nsystem and is a common thread which has run through a number of the sections above.\n\nAs recognized in Principle 10 of the Rio Declaration, there are direct links to the cross-\n\ncutting issue of public participation - without information participation becomes difficult\n\nand frustrating.  The public today expects access to information and modern technology\n\nprovides the means to achieve it.\n\nIn  the Physical  Development Planning  process  progress  has been  made  with the draft\n\nrevised PDP available on-line ahead of the consultation meetings last year.  In keeping\n\nwith  this,  evidence  that  forms  the  basis  for  future  review  of  the  PDP  and  monitoring\n\nreports should be made available on-line also.  In this context, it is recognized that a large\n\nelement  of  the  data  that  forms  the  PDP  evidence  base  actually  comes  from  other\n\nGovernment departments and agencies.  Sometimes there is an unwillingness to share\n\nthis data between (or even within) departments.  It is recognized that  the TCDPO has\n\nbeen moving in the right direction on this issue and there is a need for other departments\n\nand agencies to do likewise.\n\nTurning to development control and other regulatory aspects of the system, the current\n\nAct requires the CTP to keep a Register which takes the form of a paper document.  This\n\nis available for consultation by members of the public who visit the TCDPO; however,\n\nthere is no deadline for making entries in the Register so the available information is often\n\nincomplete and unreliable. Further, as recognized by the High Court and Court of Appeal\n\nof  the  Eastern  Caribbean  Supreme  Court  in  the  recent  case  of  Anne  Hendricks  Bass  v\n\nDirector of Physical Planning, access to the brief notes in the planning register without\n\naccess  to  the  documents  and  plans  submitted  cannot  provide  adequate  information\n\nconcerning  planning  applications. In the context of 2018 and the Information Age this\n\ndoes not constitute an acceptable level of access.\n\nWhile recognizing that there are funding constraints on how much progress we can make\n\nin the short term, it  is worth looking  at what can  be done to give the public access to\n63\n\n\finformation  elsewhere.    In  England  and  Wales  the  Planning  Portal  is  a  joint  venture\n\nestablished in 2002 between central government, local government and a private sector\n\nservice provider.  It is the route for submission of almost all planning and building control\n\napplications and follows every application through the decision-making process.  It also\n\ncovers  appeals,  including  enforcement  appeals  and  applications  for  listed  building\n\nconsent.    The  information  available  to  the  public  is  extensive.    Full  details  of  every\n\napplication including drawings and  supporting  data such as design statements, traffic\n\nstudies  and  EIAs  can  be  accessed.    Responses  to  statutory  consultations,  third  party\n\ncomments and planning officers’ reports are available along with copies of all decisions\n\nwith  reasons.    For  appeals,  all  witness  statements,  proofs  of  evidence  and  inspectors’\n\nreports are available.  The Planning Portal complies with UK freedom of information and\n\ndata  protection  legislation.    In  normal  circumstances  the  only  information  that  is  not\n\nfreely accessible is commercially confidential material and this is strictly defined.  In the\n\nUK Council planning meetings are open to the public and minutes of these meetings are\n\npublished on-line.  Some Councils regularly stream their committee meetings.\n\nWhile recognizing the cost of the UK approach and the fact that it would take a long time\n\nto develop something similar, it is possible to introduce some changes at relatively little\n\nor  no  cost.    For  instance,  the  CTP  should  publish  on-line  and  via  email  to  the  press  a\n\nmeaningful weekly list of applications received and decisions made.  As a minimum, this\n\nlist should show the date received, the application number, the applicant, the location of\n\nthe site and the nature of the development proposed.  For decisions it should also show\n\nthe date of the decision and whether permission was granted or refused.  The list should\n\nalso  include  decisions  on  applications  referred  to  the  Minister  and  appeals.    This  step\n\nforward does not require new legislation and could be implemented in the short term\n\nwithout prejudicing the full package of reform.\n\n#### C.\n\nInter-Agency Consultations\n\nStatutory consultations on planning applications are a major contribution to inefficiency\n\nin the system.  The CTP complains that  agencies  do not meet their  deadlines and this\n\ncauses  delay  in  determining  applications  or  submitting  his  case  on  matters  that  are\n\nreferred  to  the  Minister  for  decision.    The  referral  agencies  complain  that  they  have\n\ninsufficient resources in terms of personnel or technology to handle these consultations\n\nefficiently.\n\n64\n\n\fSection 17(2)(b) of the current Act says the Minister may require the CTP to consult with\n\nthe Town and Country Planning Advisory Committee and other authorities by way of an\n\norder or directions.  Para 8 of the 1972 Development Order addresses this with detailed\n\nrequirements  to  consult  the  relevant  Minister  (or  such  person  as  the  Minister  may\n\nappoint) on transport, traffic and drainage, on agricultural implications of development,\n\nand the Water Board (now impliedly the Barbados Water Authority).  Para 8(3) gives the\n\nMinister power to extend that direction to other statutory boards and persons.  Para (4)\n\ndirects the CTP to allow a period of not less than 14 days and not more than 21 days for\n\nreferral agancies to respond before he can make a decision.  Para (5) allows the CTP to\n\nconsult  other  boards,  persons  or  bodies  as  appropriate  including  the  Chief  Medical\n\nOfficer, statutory undertakers, the Port Manager, the Harbour Master and the Director of\n\nCivil  Aviation.    The  detail  in  the  Development  Order  is  outdated  and  needs  revision.\n\nThere is also an anomaly in that it does not refer to the Director of the CZMU although\n\ns.17(1C) of the Act is a 1998 amendment requiring the Minister to consult the Director of\n\nCoastal Zone Management before granting or refusing planning permission under  s.15\n\nwhich relates to Development Orders.\n\nDefects  in  the  statutory  consultations  process  are  one  of  the  major  concerns  of\n\nstakeholders.  It is considered that the process of transporting files from office to office is\n\noutmoded.    Stakeholders  think  electronic  communications  (including  simple  e-mail\n\nmethods) should be used.  There is also criticism that some departments do not have the\n\ntechnological  capacity  to  receive  plans  and  respond  by  electronic  means.    Also,  it  is\n\nrecognized  that  responding  to  planning  consultations  is  not  a  high  priority  in  some\n\noperational departments.  There is a feeling amongst stakeholders that deadlines need to\n\nbe met but an understanding that personnel and skills shortages can prevent this.  This\n\nis an area where there could be stakeholder support for “spend to save” measures that\n\nwould provide necessary technology and fill skills gaps.\n\nIt is recommended that -\n\n  The Development Order should be updated as it relates to statutory consultations.\n  There should be a specific requirement to consult the Director of the CZMU and\n\nthere  should  be  a  clearer  expectation  of  consultation  with  relevant  non-\n\ngovernmental  bodies  on  applications  which  relate  to  their  areas  of  interest  and\n\nexpertise.\n\n65\n\n\f  Electronic  means  of  communication  should  become  the  norm  for  these\n\nconsultations.\n\n  The TCPDO should have service level agreements with the major referral agencies.\n\nSuch agreements would make it clear at what point the  TCPDO would proceed\n\nwithout a particular body’s input.\n\nIt  is  noted  that  there  could  be  an  improvement  in  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of\n\nstatutory  consultations  as  a  by-product  of  the  proposed  governance  arrangements.\n\nReferral  agencies  will  be  represented  on  the  Sustainable  Development  Board  and  this\n\nmay itself give a higher priority to responding.  Also, people on the Board will be able to\n\ngive a “back-stop” response for their department or agency if an application comes to the\n\nBoard before a formal response has been received.\n\nAnother suggestion that came out of the stakeholder consultations was that there should\n\nbe  meetings  early  in  the  consideration  of  an  application  (possibly  before  submission)\n\ninvolving the planners, relevant referral agencies and the applicant as a more regular part\n\nof the process.  This would give everyone the opportunity to make their requirements\n\nclear early on.  This idea relates to the broader question of how complex applications are\n\nmanaged.  Simple time limits can be inappropriate to these applications and it is better to\n\nadopt a project management approach involving the applicant and agree the tasks that\n\nneed to be completed and set a time line for achieving them.\n\nThis  leads  to  consideration  of  the  issue  of  having  a  “one  stop  shop”  for  planning\n\napplications and related permits.  Stakeholder feeling was ambivalent:\n\ni.\n\nii.\niii.\n\nThere  was  an  enthusiasm  for  the  idea  of  making  all  applications  to  one  point\n\n(preferably by electronic means)\n\nThere was an enthusiasm for the idea of co-locating staff\n\nThere was a resistance to conflating all applications in one submission – basically\n\nthis reflects a design process where the principles are established (and planning\n\nconsent often obtained) before expensive detailed design work is undertaken)\n\niv.  There  was  criticism  that  some  agencies  were  using  the  development  control\n\nsystem to introduce requirements that did not have planning relevance simply\n\nbecause other regulatory systems were inadequate.\n\n66\n\n\fIt is suggested that points i. and ii. are taken forward as the opportunity arises and that\n\npoints iii. and iv. are borne in mind.\n\nIt  is  necessary  to  make  specific  reference  to  building  standards  and  building  control.\n\nWhile  these  issues  do  not  strictly  relate  to  inter-agency  consultation  on  planning\n\napplications,  there  was  considerable  discussion  relating  to  them  at  the  stakeholder\n\nevents.  Nobody suggested that an island like Barbados in the Caribbean hurricane belt\n\ndoes not need an appropriate set of building standards.  There was considerable debate\n\nabout  the  way  these  should  be  delivered.    There  was  criticism  of  the  currently  un-\n\nproclaimed legislation as representing an expensive public sector model that the country\n\ncould not afford.  There was strong support from the private sector professionals in the\n\nstakeholder events for a system of self-certification of plans by qualified and registered\n\nprofessionals (backed by insurance) and inspection by independent professionals.  While\n\nnot  within  the  remit  of  this  paper,  it  is  noted  that  new  legislation  will  be  needed  on\n\nbuilding standards to achieve an effective and affordable solution.\n\n#### D.  Certification of Compliance\n\nSection  21  of  the  Act  indicates  that  where  a  person  who  proposes  to  carry  out  any\n\noperation on land or make any changes in the use of land wishes to have it determined\n\nwhether  the  proposal  constitutes  development  and,  if  it  does,  whether  a  planning\n\napplication  is  required,  he  may  apply  to  the  CTP  for  a  determination.    Any  person\n\ndissatisfied in point of law may appeal to a judge. It is reported that financial institutions\n\nin Barbados require borrowers to produce certification that works constitute permitted\n\ndevelopment prior to granting loans for such works. Presumably this is being done under\n\nthis section.\n\nThere  are  no  provisions  in  the  Act  relative  to  issuing  certificates  of  compliance  per  se;\n\nhowever,  certificates  issued  by  the  CTP  are  required  under  other  statutes  (e.g:  under\n\nPublic Entertainment Act, CAP.85A, s.4(1)(a); and the Special Development Areas Act,\n\nCAP.237A  s.5).  Moreover,  it  has  become  an  established  practice  in  Barbados  for  legal\n\npractitioners  to  apply  to  the  CTP  for  certificates  of  compliance  as  part  of  the  search\n\nprocess to verify that the title to property to be conveyed to purchasers is good. This is\n\nnecessitated  in  part  because  the  TCPDO  does  not  maintain  a  register  of  enforcement\n\nproceedings.\n\n67\n\n\fThe England and Wales legislation (Town and Country Planning Act 1990: Section 191 as\n\namended  by  section  10  of  the  Planning  and  Compensation  Act  1991  and  the  Town  and\n\nCountry Planning (General Development Procedure) Order (England) 2015) has similar\n\nprovisions  for  the  issuing  of  a  Lawful  Development  Certificate.  A  Lawful  Development\n\nCertificate  is  a  legal  document  stating  the  lawfulness  of  past,  present  or  future  building  use,\n\noperations, or other matters. If granted by the local planning authority, the certificate means that\n\nenforcement  action  cannot  be  carried  out  with  respect  to  the  development  referred  to  in  the\n\ncertificate.\n\nThe certificate is not a planning permission. The planning merits of the use, operation or\n\nactivity in the application are not relevant. The issue of a certificate depends entirely on\n\nfactual evidence about the history and planning status of the building or other land and\n\nthe interpretation of any relevant planning law or judicial authority. The responsibility is\n\non the applicant to provide evidence to support the application.\n\nAn application for a Lawful Development Certificate form should be used to establish\n\nwhether:\n\n  an existing use of land, or some operational development, or some activity in\n\n#### breach of a planning condition, is lawful\n\n  a proposed use of buildings or other land, or some operations proposed to be\n\ncarried out in, on, over, or under land, would be lawful\n\nExamples when an application for a Lawful Development Certificate should be made\ninclude:\n\no  when planning enforcement action is taken by the local planning authority and\n\nthe  owner  believes  it  is  immune  from  action  because  the  time  limit  for  taking\n\nenforcement action has passed\n\n#### o  when  an  owner  discovers,  in  the  course  of  a  sale  of  the  land,  that  planning\n\npermission has never been granted, and needs to show a prospective purchaser\n\nthat no enforcement action can be taken by the local planning authority\n\nA certificate granted for a proposed, or an existing use, operation or activity will specify\n\n(by reference to a plan or drawing) the area of land included in the certificate and describe\n\nthe precise  nature  of the use, operation or activity which  is lawful. The certificate will\n\n68\n\n\fgive the reason for determining the use or operation to be lawful and specify the date of\n\nthe application for the certificate.\n\nIn UK legislation it is an offence to provide false or misleading information or to withhold\n\nmaterial  information  with intent to deceive.  The council to can revoke, at any time, a\n\ncertificate they may have issued as a result of such false or misleading information.\n\nRecommendation -\n\n#### o  That the existing legislation and procedures relating to Certificates of Compliance\n\nbe reviewed and brought up to date.\n\n#### E.  Use of Technology\n\nThe increased use of technology in the planning system could significantly advance inter-\n\nagency consultations, decision making time-frames, transparency and modernization of\n\nplanning  practice\n\nin  Barbados.  Recent  stakeholder  consultations  and  other\n\nrepresentations by professional bodies have pointed to a number of concerns that centre\n\non out-dated management systems in planning practice.  Those challenges and concerns\n\ninclude the manual circulation of files for consultation within the TCDPO and between\n\nthe  TCDPO  and  other  consulting  agencies,  the  limited  or  incomplete  land  registration\n\nsystem as a basis for forward planning to facilitate development and investment, poor\n\npublic access  to  information on proposed developments,  limited on-line information on\n\nthe number and types of development applications being received by the TCDPO and\n\nthe limited use of google earth images to manage unauthorised developments, among\n\nothers matters.\n\nIt is expected that a shift to a more digital system of planning  would facilitate a more\n\ntransparent  planning  system  through  greater  public  involvement  and  participation.\n\nAdditionally, greater incorporation of technology into the planning process, specifically\n\ndevelopment  control  and  enforcement,  can  lead  to  a  more  efficient  planning  system.\n\nIncorporation  of  technology  can  facilitate  timelier  completion  of  tasks  (e.g.  review  of\n\napplications)  while  reducing  the  need  for  repetitive  tasks  which  may  lead  to  more\n\nmanageable workloads for planning officials and increase productivity.\n\nIn  particular,  stakeholders  have  emphasised  the  need  for  a  dynamic  process  for  the\n\nmonitoring  of  changes  to  the  development  plan  facilitated  by  an  updated  digital\n\n69\n\n\finformation  sharing  platform.  This  might  involve  an  easily  accessible  digital  forum\n\nwhere the public can not only view proposed changes to development plans but share\n\ntheir views and comments on such amendments on a digital platform. Recently, the Draft\n\nPDP  2017  was  uploaded  to  a  website  and  the  public  was  able  to  offer  feedback  and\n\ncomments of the proposed revisions to the PDP. It has been proposed that this process be\n\ntaken further and once the development plan is approved by the Government the pattern\n\nof development decisions could be viewed by the public on an on-going basis.\n\nThere  has  also  been  also  a  suggestion  for  the  use  of  digital  evidence  in  legal  cases\n\nconcerning planning enforcement. An example used was Google Earth, which provides\n\nsatellite  imagery  at  a  relatively  high  spatial  resolution.  As  such  it  could  employed  to\n\ndelineate  for  example  breaches  into  areas  where  development  is  not  permitted  (e.g.\n\ncoastal  setbacks,  ecologically  sensitive  areas,  and  heritage  sites).  Conversely  it  could\n\nprove useful in the settling of disputes concerning land encroachment. The main benefit\n\nis that evidence of this form can be provided in-situ during a court session and could be\n\nreferred to in an attempt to settle relevant disputes.\n\nThere have been strong calls from stakeholders for a shift to an electronic / web-based\n\nsystem  for  the  submission  and  review  of  development  applications.  Specifically,\n\nstakeholders  stated  that  an  electronic  planning  application  process  would  be  more\n\nefficient and would ultimately facilitate a more timely decision. Additional components\n\nof  such  a  system  include:  a)  a  publicly  accessible  GIS  database  of  areas  where\n\ndevelopment  is  not  permitted,  b)  electronic  submission  of  planning  applications,  c)\n\ndigitization  of  planning  applications  and  fully  digital  process  for  circulation  of\n\napplications to agencies involved in approval of planning applications (e.g. applications\n\ndatabase / emails), d)  an online system  for public tracking  progress of applications, e)\n\nposting notices of applications on-line\n\nA number of countries have incorporated some of the changes requested by stakeholders\n\ninto  their  planning  systems.  One  such  country  is  Singapore,  which  has  made  fully\n\naccessible to the public the present main development plan (Master Plan), as well as past\n\nversions of that particular plan. The plan is in the format of an interactive map which\n\nshows the various land uses within the nation.\n\n70\n\n\fFigure 3: Singapore’s Master Plan (sourced from Urban Redevelopment Authority 2018)\n\nAny member of the public is able to view the permitted land uses and zones in any part\n\nof the country and toggle off or on various layers (e.g. footpaths, cycling paths, overhead\n\npasses etc). Secondly, Singapore has an online database of proposed amendments to their\n\nMaster Plan as well as approved amendments. Amendments in their case mainly refers\n\nto proposed changes of land uses from their permitted use as outlined in the Master Plan.\n\nThe details of such amendments are also available for public inspection. This facilitates\n\nthe  public  consultation  process  required  in  Singapore,  before  any  amendment  to  the\n\nMaster Plan is made.\n\nDevelopment  plans  for  local  areas  and  some  neighbourhoods  in  England  are  easily\n\naccessible  online.  There  exists  a  database,  accessible  to  the  public,  of  all  local  plans\n\nsubmitted  in  the  country,  their  status  (how  far  they  have  progressed  in  the  approval\n\nprocess).  This  information  is  provided  in  spreadsheet  format  which  facilitates  data\n\nanalysis.  Additionally,  all  planning  applications  (updated  weekly)  and  their  status\n\n(approved, denied, etc) is accessible on the internet through the Planning Portal for all\n\nlocal areas within England. The public is also able to comment on or object to proposed\n\ndevelopments  digitally,  using  the  same  portal.  Detail  information  on  the  progress  of\n\nplanning appeals is also available.\n\nThere is the potential institutional capacity for the incorporation of digital information\n\ninto each aspect of Barbados’ planning system. The Lands and Survey Department has  a\n\nwealth of geospatial data and is a repository of all certified survey plans. This department\n71\n\n\fhas  the  largest  group  of  trained  geomatic  engineers  in  the  Government  Service.\n\nAdditionally, the Town and Country Planning Department has invested heavily in GIS\n\n(Geographical  Information  Systems),  training  and  equipment  over  the  years,  and\n\nunderstands  the  significance  of  GIS  in  the  analysis  of  planning  options  and  scenarios.\n\nPerhaps  a  jointly  operated  national  geospatial  agency  or  repository  of  geospatial  data\n\n(between  the  aforementioned  and  other  relevant  agencies)  can  be  established  so  as  to\n\nassist  in  the  preparation  of  development  plans  which  can  be  easily  and  continually\n\nmonitored for changes and updated as necessary and are easily accessible to the public.\n\nPublic  participation  and  transparency  can  be  facilitated  in  Barbados’  planning  system\n\nthrough  the  provision  of  digital  information  on  planning  applications  and  planning\n\ntrends.  Also,  provisions  should  be  made  to  strongly  encourage  or  mandate  the  use  of\n\ndigital information and electronic devices in the circulation of planning documentation\n\nbetween relevant agencies. This would most likely greatly improve the timeliness of the\n\ndevelopment planning application process and lead to a more efficient system.\n\n### 6.     Implementation\n\nIntroducing the legislation\n\nThe reforms to the town planning system recommended in this paper will require major\n\nchanges to both primary and subordinate legislation.  It is proposed that Barbados will\n\nhave a new Town and Country Planning Act.  This will be drafted by October and should\n\npass through both Houses of Parliament by 30 November.  The Act can then receive the\n\nRoyal  Assent  but  should  not  be  proclaimed  until  all  the  subordinate  legislation  and\n\nadministrative changes are in place.\n\nAfter the Act has been drafted work can start on the subordinate legislation.  This will\n\ninclude  the  new  General  Development  Order,  a  Use  Classes  Order,  and  Regulations\n\ncovering amongst other things the operations of the Sustainable Development Board and\n\nthe Planning Appeals Tribunal.  By its nature this subordinate legislation is technical and\n\ndetailed.  It is suggested that its preparation would be assisted by targeted consultation\n\non specific aspects with appropriate professionals in the public and private sectors as well\n\nas with staff in the TCDPO and the Ministry.  It is also suggested that the target date for\n\ncompletion of drafting the subordinate legislation should be the end of March 2019.\n\n72\n\n\fOrganisational Change\n\nThis paper recommends significant changes to governance with the establishment of a\n\nSustainable Development Board and a Planning Appeals Tribunal.  This change involves\n\nnew  roles  and  responsibilities  for  the  people  involved  in  each  body.    It  also  involves\n\nchanged  roles  and  working  practices  for  staff  in  both  the  TCDPO  and  the  Minister’s\n\nOffice.    To  facilitate  all  these  changes  it  is  recommended  that  early  provisional\n\nappointments  are  made  to  the  Sustainable  Development  Board  and  to  the  Planning\n\nAppeals Tribunal.  This should be done in March 2019 and both bodies should effectively\n\nfunction in “shadow” form to undergo training before the Act is proclaimed and the new\n\nsystem goes live.\n\nTaking  into  account  the  legislative  processes  and  the  need  to  put  the  organisational\n\nchanges  in  place,  it  is  proposed  that  the  new  Act  should  be  proclaimed  and  become\n\neffective  in  June  2019  and  the  Sustainable  Development  Board  and  Planning  Appeals\n\nTribunal should take on their duties at that point.\n\nManaging the change process\n\nAt  a  number  of  points  in  this  Green  Paper  it  is  stated  that  changes  are  needed  in\n\nmanagement culture and leadership.  It is also important that processes introduced or\n\namended by the new Act are managed in a pro-active rather than reactive manner.  While\n\nintroducing new legislation is fundamentally important, we will not be fully successful\n\nin achieving our goals for reform without making these management changes.\n\nMaking  any  change  in  a  bureaucratic  system  requires  clear  and  committed  leadership\n\nfrom the senior people involved. New skills will be needed in managing the processing\n\nof planning applications, referrals to the Minister and appeals.  This will include setting\n\nand meeting targets and progress chasing.  This is a totally different approach from the\n\ncurrent “file-driven” methods.  Staff will need training in new skills.\n\nSimilarly, the existence of a Sustainable Development Board and the use of a Planning\n\nAppeals  Tribunal  will  require  different  skills  in  servicing  meetings  and  actioning\n\ndecisions. As mentioned above, the members of the Sustainable Development Board and\n\nthe Planning Appeals Tribunal will need training in their roles, responsibilities and in the\n\nnature of the processes that they are involved in.\n\n73\n\n\fAll  this  needs  to  be  in  place,  along  with  all  the  subsidiary  legislation,  before  the  new\n\nsystem can go live.  It is recommended that a project management approach is adopted\n\nto managing this programme of change.\n\nItems for early implementation\n\nNot all the changes recommended in this Green Paper require legislation, organisational\n\nchange  or  significant  expenditure.    There  are  actions  that  could  be  implemented\n\nimmediately at relatively or no cost and which would not prejudice implementation of\n\nwider reform and the new legislation.\n\nThe following items are put forward for consideration:\n\ni.  The  Chief  Town  Planner  should  publish  on-line  and  via  email  to  the  press  a\n\nmeaningful  weekly  list  of  applications  received  and  decisions  made  (including\n\ndecisions by the Minister).\n\nii.  Hearings on appeals and matters referred to the Minister should be held in public.\niii.  Voluntary disclosure of evidence in advance should be requested from all parties\n\ntaking part in S18 and S19 Hearings.\n\nPanellists should be advised to adopt a consistent approach to Hearings and site\n\nvisits.\n\nPanellists’ reports should be copied to the applicant or appellant and to the Chief\n\nTown Planner.\n\nIn all cases the Minister’s decision should be published with a justification.\n\niv.\n\nv.\n\nvi.\n\n74\n\n\fTOWN PLANNING DEPARTMENT\nBlock C, Garrison, St Michael\nTel: 246 535-3000\n\n75\n\n"
