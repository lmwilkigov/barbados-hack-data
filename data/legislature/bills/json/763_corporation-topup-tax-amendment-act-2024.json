financial statements of the ultimate parent entity in at least\n2 of the 4 fiscal years immediately preceding the tested fiscal year;\nand\n\n(d)\n\nthe entity is not an excluded entity.\n\n(3)\n\nA joint venture shall be considered to be a qualifying entity where\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nit is located in Barbados; and\n\nthe financial results of which are reported under the equity method in\nthe consolidated financial statements of the ultimate parent entity of an\nMNE group that has an annual revenue of €750 000 000 or more in its\nconsolidated  financial  statements  in  at  least  2  of  the  4  fiscal  years\nimmediately preceding the tested fiscal year.\n\nA  joint  venture  subsidiary  shall  be  considered  to  be  a  qualifying  entity\n\n(4)\nwhere it is\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nlocated in Barbados; and\n\nconsolidated  by  a  joint  venture  that  meets  the  conditions  under\nsubsection (3)(b).\n\nWhere one or more of the fiscal years of a qualifying entity is of a period\n(5)\nlonger or shorter than 12 months, the revenue threshold in subsection (2)(c) and\nsubsection (3)(b) shall be calculated as follows:\n\n€750,000,000 x A/365 where A is the number of days in the fiscal\nyear concerned.\n\n(6)\n\nFor the purposes of this section “excluded entity” means\n\n(a)\n\na  governmental  entity,  an  international  organisation,  a  non-profit\norganisation, a pension fund, an investment fund that is an ultimate\nparent entity or a real estate investment vehicle that is an ultimate parent\nentity;\n\n\f24\n\n(b)\n\nan entity where at least 95 per cent of

carries out activities ancillary to those performed by\nthe entity or entities referred to in paragraph (a);\n\n(c)\n\nan entity where at least 85 per cent of the value of the entity is owned,\ndirectly or through one or several excluded entities, by one or more\nentities referred to in paragraph (a), except pension services entities,\nprovided that substantially all of entity’s income is excluded dividends\nor  excluded  equity  gains  or  losses  that  are  excluded  from  the\ncomputation of the qualifying income or loss in accordance with Part\nIII.\n\nLocation of an entity\n\n7.(1)\nFor the purposes of this Act, an entity other than a flow-through entity\nshall be determined to be located in the jurisdiction where it is considered to be\nresident for tax purposes based on its\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nplace of management;\n\nplace of incorporation or\n\ncriteria similar to (a) or (b).\n\nWhere it is not possible to determine the location of an entity other than a\n(2)\nflow-through entity based on subsection (1), it shall be deemed to be located in\nthe jurisdiction where it was incorporated.\n\n(3)\n\nA flow-through entity shall be considered to be stateless, unless it is\n\n(a)\n\nthe ultimate parent entity of an MNE group; or\n\n\f(b)\n\nrequired to apply an IIR,\n\n25\n\nin  which  case,  the  flow-through  entity  shall  be  deemed  to  be  located  in  the\njurisdiction where it was incorporated.\n\n(4)\n\nA permanent establishment\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nas  defined  in  section  2,  paragraph  (a)  of  the  definition  shall  be\ndetermined  to  be  located  in  the  jurisdiction  where  it  is  treated  as  a\npermanent establishment and is liable to tax under the applicable tax\ntreaty;\n\nas  defined  in  section  2,  paragraph  (b)  of  the  definition  shall  be\ndetermined to be located in the jurisdiction where it is subject to net\nbasis taxation based on its business presence;\n\nas  defined  in  section  2,  paragraph  (c)  of  the  definition  shall  be\ndetermined to be located in the jurisdiction where it is situated;\n\nas  defined  in  section  2,  paragraph  (d)  of  the  definition  shall  be\nconsidered to be stateless.\n\nWhere a constituent entity is located in Barbados and another jurisdiction\n(5)\nand that jurisdiction has an applicable tax treaty with Barbados, the constituent\nentity shall be deemed to be located in the jurisdiction where it is considered to\nbe resident for tax purposes under that tax treaty.\n\n(6)\n\nWhere\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe applicable tax treaty referred to in subsection (5) requires that the\ncompetent  authorities  reach  a  mutual  agreement  on  the  deemed\nresidence for tax purposes of the constituent entity, and no agreement\nis reached; or\n\nthere is no relief for double taxation under the applicable tax treaty,\nreferred to in subsection (5), due to the fact that a constituent entity is\nresident for tax purposes in both contracting parties\n\nsubsection (7) shall apply;\n\n\f26\n\n(7)\nWhere a constituent entity is located in Barbados and another jurisdiction\nand that jurisdiction does not have an applicable tax treaty with Barbados, the\nconstituent entity shall be deemed to be located in the jurisdiction which charged\nthe higher amount of covered taxes for the fiscal year.\n\nFor the purpose of computing the amount of covered taxes referred to in\n(8)\nthe subsection (7), the amount of tax paid in accordance with a controlled foreign\ncompany tax regime shall not be taken into consideration.\n\nIf the amount of covered taxes due in Barbados and another jurisdiction is\n(9)\nthe  same  or  zero,  the  constituent  entity  shall  be  deemed  to  be  located  in  the\njurisdiction where it has the higher amount of substance-based income exclusion\ncomputed on an entity basis in accordance with section 31.\n\nIf the amount of the substance-based income exclusion in Barbados and\n(10)\nanother jurisdiction is the same or zero, the constituent entity shall be considered\nto be stateless, unless it is an ultimate parent entity, in which case it shall be\ndeemed to be located in the jurisdiction where it was created.\n\nWhere a constituent entity changes its location in the course of a fiscal\n(11)\nyear, it shall be deemed to be located in the jurisdiction where it was deemed to\nbe located under this section at the beginning of that fiscal year.\n\nCurrency conversion\n\nEvery amount relevant to the computation of the qualifying income\n8.(1)\nor  loss  of  a  qualifying  entity  for  a  fiscal  year  should  be  consistent  with  the\nreporting currency as defined in subsection (4).\n\nIf an amount that is relevant to the computation of the qualifying income\n(2)\nor loss of a qualifying entity for a fiscal year is denominated in a currency other\nthan  the  reporting  currency  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the\nultimate parent entity of the qualifying entity and is not converted to the relevant\nreporting  currency  in  the  course  of  preparing  the  consolidated  financial\nstatements, that amount is to be converted to the relevant reporting currency using\nthe foreign currency translation principles of the financial accounting standard\nthat  would  have  been  used  to  convert  the  amount  to  the  relevant  reporting\n\n\f27\n\ncurrency  if  that  conversion  were  undertaken  in  the  course  of  preparing  the\nconsolidated financial statements.\n\nNotwithstanding the generality of subsection (1), when determining if any\n(3)\nmateriality or other threshold in this Act that is denominated in the currency of\nthe European Monetary Union is satisfied or exceeded by an amount in respect\nof a group, entity or jurisdiction for a particular fiscal year, the amount is to be\nconverted from that currency to the currency of the European Monetary Union\nusing the average of the daily rates of exchange, in respect of the 2 currencies for\nthe  month  of  December  included  in  the  fiscal  year,  one  year  immediately\npreceding the particular fiscal year, as determined by the Central Bank.\n\nFor the purposes of this section “reporting currency” means the relevant\n(4)\nreporting  currency  utilised  in  the  course  of  the  preparation  of  a  consolidated\nfinancial statement.\n\nPART

income  or  loss  of  a  qualifying  entity  based  on  the  acceptable  financial\n\n\f28\n\naccounting  standard  or  authorised  financial  accounting  standard  used  in  the\npreparation of the consolidated financial statements of the ultimate parent entity,\nthe financial accounting net income or loss of the qualifying entity for the fiscal\nyear may be determined using another acceptable financial accounting standard\nor an authorised financial accounting standard provided that\n\n(a)\n\nthe financial accounts of the qualifying entity are maintained based on\nthat accounting standard;\n\n(b)\n\nthe information contained in the financial accounts is reliable; and\n\n(c)\n\npermanent  differences  in  excess  of  €1  000  000  that  arise  from  the\napplication of a particular principle or standard to items of income or\nexpense or transactions, where that principle or standard differs from\nthe  financial  standard  used  in  the  preparation  of  the  consolidated\nfinancial  statements  of  the  ultimate  parent  entity,  are  adjusted  to\nconform to the treatment required for that item under the accounting\nstandard  used  in  the  preparation  of  the  consolidated  financial\nstatements.\n\nAdjustment to Determine Qualifying Income or Loss\n\nGeneral approach to adjustment to determine qualifying income or\nloss\n\n10.(1)\nA qualifying

foreign  currency  gain  or  loss  is\nincluded in the taxable income\n\nthe tax functional currency is the functional currency used to determine the\nqualifying entity’s taxable income or loss for a covered tax in the jurisdiction\nin which it is located; the accounting functional currency is the functional\ncurrency used to determine the qualifying entity’s financial accounting net\nincome  or

substitute\n11.(1)\nthe amount allowed as a deduction for the computation of its taxable income in\nits location for the amount expensed in its financial accounts for a cost or expense\nof such qualifying entity that was paid with stock-based compensation.\n\nWhere  the  option  to  use  the  stock-options  has  not  been  exercised,  the\n(2)\namount of stock-based compensation cost or expense that has been deducted from\nthe  financial  accounting  net  income  or  loss  of  the  qualifying  entity  for  the\ncomputation of its qualifying income or loss for all previous fiscal years shall be\nincluded in the fiscal year in which that option has expired.\n\nWhere part of the amount of stock-based compensation cost or expense\n(3)\nhas been recorded in the financial accounts of the qualifying entity in fiscal years\nprior to the fiscal year in which the election is made, an amount equal to the\ndifference between the total amount of stock-based compensation cost or

from  the\ncomputation of the qualifying income or loss of a qualifying entity under the\nsubsection (1).\n\nThe carrying value of an asset or a liability for the purpose of determining\n(3)\na gain or a loss under the subsection (1) shall be the carrying value at the time\nthe asset was acquired or the liability was incurred, or on the first day of the fiscal\nyear in which the election is made, whichever date is the latest.\n\nThe election shall be made in accordance with section 44(1) and shall apply\n(4)\nto all qualifying entities located in the jurisdiction to which the election is made,\nunless the filing entity chooses to limit the election to the tangible assets of the\nqualifying entities or to investment entities.\n\nIn the fiscal year in which the election is revoked, an amount equal to the\n(5)\ndifference between the fair value of the asset or liability and the carrying value\nof the asset or liability on the first day of the fiscal year in which the revocation\nis made, determined pursuant to the election, shall be included, if the fair value\nexceeds the carrying value, or deducted, if the carrying value exceeds the fair\nvalue,  for  the  computation  of  the  qualifying  income  or  loss  of  the  qualifying\nentities.\n\n\f35\n\nTangible asset gain or loss adjustment to determine qualifying income\nor loss\n\n15.(1)\nAt the election of the filing entity,

be\nadjusted as set out in this section.\n\nThe net gain shall be offset first against the net loss, if any, that has arisen\n\n(2)\nin the earliest fiscal year of the five-year period.\n\nAny residual amount of net gain shall be carried forward and offset against\n(3)\nany net losses that have arisen in subsequent fiscal years of the five-year period.\n\nAny residual amount of net gain that remains shall be spread evenly over\n(4)\nthe five-year period for the computation of the qualifying income or loss of each\nqualifying entity located in that jurisdiction that has made a net gain from the\ndisposal of tangible assets as referred to in the subsection (1) in the fiscal year in\nwhich the election is made.\n\nThe residual amount of net gain allocated to a qualifying entity shall be\n(5)\nproportionate to the net gain of that qualifying entity divided by the net gain of\nall qualifying entities.\n\nWhere  no  qualifying  entity  has  made  a  net  gain  from  the  disposal  of\n(6)\ntangible  assets  as  referred  to  in  subsection  (1)  in  the  fiscal  year  in  which  the\nelection is made, the residual amount of net gain as referred to subsections (4)\nand (5) shall be allocated equally to each qualifying entity and spread evenly over\nthe five-year period for the computation of the qualifying income or loss of each\nof those qualifying entities.\n\nAny adjustment under this section for the fiscal years preceding the fiscal\n(7)\nyear in which the election is made shall be subject to adjustments in accordance\nwith section 32.\n\n(8)\n\nThe election

conditions are met:\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nit  can  reasonably  be  anticipated  that,  the  intra-group  financing\narrangement will, over its expected duration, increase the amount of\nexpenses  taken  into  account  in  the  computation  of  the  qualifying\nincome or loss of that qualifying entity;\n\nit  can  reasonably  be  anticipated  that  the  intra-group  financing\narrangement would not result in a commensurate increase in the taxable\nincome of the counter party;\n\nthe  counterparty  is  located  in  a  jurisdiction  that  is  not  a  low-tax\njurisdiction or in a jurisdiction that would not have been low-taxed if\nthe  income  related  to  the  expense  had  not  been  accrued  by  the\ncounterparty; and\n\n\f37\n\n(d)\n\nthe qualifying entity has an ETR below 15 per cent

purpose of computing the net qualifying income or loss of those qualifying\nentities.\n\n(2)\n\nThe election shall be made in accordance with section 44.\n\nIn the fiscal year in which the election is made or revoked, appropriate\n(3)\nadjustments shall be made so that items of qualifying income or loss are not taken\ninto  consideration  more  than  once  or  omitted  as  a  result  of  such  election  or\nrevocation.\n\nInsurance companies adjustment to determine qualifying income or\nloss\n\n18.(1)\nAn  insurance  company  shall  exclude  from  the  computation  of  its\nqualifying income or loss any amount charged to policyholders for taxes paid by\nthe insurance company in respect of returns to the policyholders.\n\nAn insurance company shall include in the computation of its

Barbados.\n\nWhere  the  computation  of  a  qualifying  entity’s  international  shipping\n(2)\nincome and qualified ancillary international shipping income results in a loss,\nsuch  loss  shall  be  excluded  from  the  computation  of  the  qualifying  entity’s\nqualifying income or loss.\n\nThe  aggregated  qualified  ancillary  international  shipping  income  of  all\n(3)\nqualifying

that  indirectly  result  from  its\n(5)\ninternational  shipping  activities  and  qualified  ancillary  international  shipping\nactivities  shall  be  deducted  from  the  qualifying  entity’s  revenues  from  such\nactivities to compute the international shipping income and qualified ancillary\ninternational shipping income of the constituent entity on the basis of its revenues\nfrom such activities in proportion to its total revenues.\n\nAll direct and indirect costs attributed to a qualifying entity’s international\n(6)\nshipping  income  and  qualified  ancillary  international  shipping  income  in\naccordance with subsections (4) and (5) shall be excluded from the computation\nof its qualifying income or loss.\n\n(7)\n\nFor the purposes of this section,\n\n“international

financial accounting net income or loss\nshall be the net income or loss reflected in the separate financial accounts of that\npermanent establishment.\n\nWhere  a  permanent  establishment  does  not  have  separate  financial\n(2)\naccounts, its financial accounting net income or loss shall be the amount that\nwould  have  been  reflected  in  its  separate  financial  accounts  if  they  had  been\nprepared on a standalone basis and in accordance with the accounting standard\nused in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements of the ultimate\nparent entity.\n\nA permanent establishment’s financial accounting net income or loss shall\n(3)\nbe adjusted to reflect only the amounts and items of income and expense that are\nattributable  to  it  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  tax  treaty  or  enactment,\nregardless of the amount of income subject to tax and the amount of deductible\nexpenses.\n\nThe financial accounting net income or loss of a permanent establishment\n(4)\nshall not be taken into account in determining the qualifying income or loss of\nthe main entity, except as provided in subsection (5).\n\nA loss of a permanent establishment shall be treated as an expense of the\n(5)\nmain entity (and not of the permanent establishment) for purposes of computing\nits  qualifying  income  or  loss  to  the  extent  that  the  loss  of  the  permanent\nestablishment is treated as an expense in the computation of the domestic taxable\nincome of such main entity and is not set off against an item of income that is\nsubject to tax under the laws of both the jurisdiction of the main entity and the\njurisdiction of the permanent establishment.\n\nQualifying  income  that  is  subsequently  arising  in  the  permanent\n(6)\nestablishment shall be treated as qualifying income of the main entity (and not\n\n\f42\n\nof the permanent establishment) up to the amount of the qualifying loss that was\npreviously treated as an expense of the main entity under the subsection (5).\n\nAllocation of qualifying income or loss from a flow-through entity\n\n22.(1)\nThe financial accounting net income or loss of a constituent entity that\nis a flow-through entity shall be reduced by the amount allocable to its owners\nthat are not constituent entities and that hold their ownership interest in such flow-\nthrough  entity  directly  or  through  one  or  more  of  the  tax  transparent  entities,\nunless\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe flow-through entity is an ultimate parent entity; or\n\nthe flow-through entity is held, directly or through a tax transparent\nstructure by an ultimate parent entity referred to in paragraph (a).\n\nThe financial accounting net income or loss of a constituent entity that is\n(2)\na flow-through entity shall be reduced by the financial accounting net income or\nloss that is allocated to another constituent entity.\n\nWhere  a  flow-through  entity  wholly  or  partially  carries  out  business\n(3)\nthrough a permanent establishment, its financial accounting net income or loss\nwhich remains after applying the formulae referred to in subsection (1) shall be\nallocated to that permanent establishment.\n\nWhere  a  flow-through  entity  is  a  tax  transparent  entity  that  is  not  the\n(4)\nultimate parent entity, the financial accounting net income or loss of the flow-\nthrough entity which remains after applying the formulae set out subsection (1)\nand (3) shall be allocated to its constituent entity-owners in accordance with their\nownership interests in the flow-through entity.\n\nWhere a flow-through entity is a tax transparent entity that is the ultimate\n(5)\nparent entity, any financial accounting net income or loss of the flow-through\nentity  which  remains  after  applying  the  allocation  to  any  permanent\nestablishment shall be allocated to the ultimate parent entity.\n\nWhere  a  flow-through  entity  is  a  reverse  hybrid  entity,  any  financial\n(6)\naccounting net income or loss of the flow-through entity which remains after\n\n\f43\n\napplying the formulae set out in subsections (1) and (3) shall be allocated to the\nreverse hybrid entity.\n\nSubsections (3), (4) and (5) shall be applied separately with respect to each\n\n(7)\nownership interest in the flow-through entity.\n\nPART IV\n\nCOMPUTATION OF ADJUSTED COVERED TAXES\n\nCovered taxes\n\n23.(1)\n\nThe covered taxes of a qualifying entity shall include\n\n(a)\n\ntaxes  recorded  in  the  financial  accounts  of  a  qualifying  entity  with\nrespect to its

relates to a qualified refundable tax credit;\n\nthe  amount  of  current  tax  expense  that  relates  to  an  uncertain  tax\nposition; and\n\nany amount of current tax expense that is not expected to be paid within\n3 years after the end of the fiscal year.\n\nAn amount referred to in subsections (1), (2) and (3) shall only be taken\n\n(4)\ninto account once for the purpose of computing adjusted covered taxes\n\nWhere, in a fiscal year, there is no net qualifying income and the amount\n(5)\nof adjusted covered taxes is negative and less than an amount equal to the net\nqualifying  loss  multiplied  by  the  minimum  tax  rate,  the  amount  equal  to  the\ndifference  between  the  amount  of  adjusted  covered  taxes  and  the  amount  of\nexpected adjusted covered taxes shall be treated as an additional current top-up\ntax for that fiscal year.\n\nThe  amount  of  additional  current  top-up  tax  shall  be  allocated  to  each\n\n(6)\nqualifying entity in the jurisdiction in accordance with section 31.\n\nTotal deferred tax adjustment amount\n\n25.(1)\nWhere the tax rate applied for the purpose of computing the deferred\ntax  expense  is  equal  or  below  the  minimum  tax  rate,  the  total  deferred  tax\nadjustment amount to be added to the adjusted covered taxes of a qualifying entity\nfor a fiscal year pursuant to section 24(1)(b), shall be the deferred tax

rate  lower  than  the\nminimum tax rate, it may be recast at the minimum tax rate in the same fiscal\n\n\f47\n\nyear, provided that the taxpayer is able to demonstrate that the deferred tax asset\nis attributable to a qualifying loss.\n\nWhere a deferred tax asset is increased pursuant to the subsection (6), the\n\n(7)\ntotal deferred tax adjustment amount shall be reduced accordingly.\n\nA deferred tax liability that is not reversed and whose amount is not paid\n(8)\nwithin the 5 subsequent fiscal years shall be recaptured to the extent it was taken\ninto account in the total deferred

in accordance with section 21, any covered\ntaxes arising in the jurisdiction where the permanent establishment is located and\nassociated with such income shall be treated as covered taxes of the main entity\nfor an amount not exceeding such income multiplied by the highest tax rate on\nordinary income in the jurisdiction where the main entity is located.\n\n(6)\n\nFor the purposes of this section\n\n“hybrid  entity”  means  an  entity  treated  as  a  separate  person  for  income  tax\npurposes in the jurisdiction where it is located but as fiscally transparent in\nthe jurisdiction in

changes\n\n28.(1)\nWhere a qualifying entity records an adjustment to its covered taxes\nin a previous fiscal year in its financial accounts, such adjustment shall be treated\nas an adjustment to covered taxes in the fiscal year in which the adjustment is\nmade, unless the adjustment relates to a fiscal year in which there is a decrease\nin covered taxes.\n\nWhere  there  is  a  decrease  in  covered  taxes  that  were  included  in  the\n(2)\nqualifying entity’s adjusted covered taxes for a previous fiscal year, the effective\ntax rate and top-up tax for such fiscal year shall be recomputed in accordance\nwith section 32(1) and (2) by reducing adjusted covered taxes by the amount of\nthe decrease in covered taxes and the qualifying income for the fiscal year and\nany previous fiscal years shall be adjusted accordingly.\n\nAt the annual election of the filing entity, made in accordance with section\n(3)\n44, an immaterial decrease in covered taxes may be treated as an adjustment to\ncovered taxes in the fiscal year in which the adjustment is made.\n\nAn immaterial decrease in covered taxes shall be an aggregate decrease of\n(4)\nless than €1 000 000 in the adjusted covered taxes determined for the jurisdiction\nfor the fiscal year.\n\nWhere the applicable domestic tax rate is reduced below the minimum tax\n(5)\nrate  and  such  reduction  results  in  a  deferred  tax  expense,  the  amount  of  the\nresulting deferred tax expense shall be treated as an adjustment to the qualifying\nentity’s liability for covered taxes that are taken into consideration pursuant to\nsection 24 for a previous fiscal year.\n\nWhere a deferred tax expense was taken into account at a rate lower than\n(6)\nthe minimum tax rate and the applicable tax rate is later increased, the amount\nof  deferred  tax  expense  that  results  from  such  increase  shall  be  treated  upon\npayment  as  an  adjustment  to  a  qualifying  entity’s  liability  for  covered  taxes\nclaimed for a previous fiscal year in accordance with section 24.\n\n\f52\n\nThe adjustment under subsection (6) shall not exceed an amount equal to\n\n(7)\nthe deferred tax expense recast at the minimum tax rate.\n\n(8)\nWhere more than €1 000 000 of the amount accrued by a qualifying entity\nas current tax expense and included in adjusted covered taxes for a fiscal year is\nnot paid within 3 years after the end of that fiscal year, the effective tax rate and\ntop-up tax for the fiscal year in which the unpaid amount was claimed as a covered\ntax shall be recomputed in accordance with section 32(1) and (2) by excluding\nsuch unpaid amount from the adjusted covered taxes.\n\nPART V\n\nCOMPUTATION OF THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND TOP-UP TAX\n\nDetermination of the effective tax rate\n\nThe effective tax rate of a DMTT Group shall be computed, for each\n29.(1)\nfiscal year, provided that there is net qualifying income, in accordance with the\nfollowing formula:\n\nEffective\ntax rate\n\n= adjusted covered taxes of qualifying entities\n\nnet qualifying income of qualifying entities\n\nwhere the adjusted covered taxes of the DMTT Group are the sum of the adjusted\ncovered taxes of all the qualifying entities located in the jurisdiction determined\nin accordance with Part IV.\n\nThe net qualifying income or loss of the DMTT Group in the jurisdiction\n(2)\nfor a fiscal year shall be determined in accordance with the following formula:\n\n\f53\n\nNet qualifying income or loss = qualifying income of the qualifying entities —\nqualifying losses of qualifying entities\n\nwhere\n\n(a)\n\nthe qualifying income of the DMTT Group is the positive sum, if any,\nof  the  qualifying  income  of  all  qualifying  entities  located  in  the\njurisdiction determined in accordance with Part III;\n\n(b)\n\nthe qualifying losses of the DMTT Group are the sum of the qualifying\nlosses of all qualifying entities determined in accordance with Part III.\n\nAdjusted covered taxes and qualifying income or loss of qualifying entities\n(3)\nto  which  section  40  applies  shall  be  excluded  from  the  computation  of  the\neffective tax rate in accordance with subsection (1) and the computation of the\nnet qualifying income in accordance with subsection (2).\n\nThe effective tax rate of each stateless constituent entity shall be computed,\n(4)\nfor each fiscal year, separately from the effective tax rate of all other constituent\nentities.\n\nComputation of top-up tax\n\n30.(1)\nWhere the effective tax rate of a DMTT Group is below the minimum\ntax rate for an income year, the qualifying entities in that DMTT Group that have\nqualifying income shall be liable to top-up tax.\n\nThe  top-up  tax  for  a  fiscal  year  shall  be  the  positive  amount,  if  any,\n\n(2)\ncomputed in accordance with the following formula:\n\nJurisdictional top-up tax=(top-up tax percentage x excess profit) + additional\ncurrent top-up tax\n\nwhere the additional current top-up tax is the amount of tax as determined in\naccordance with section 32 for the fiscal year.\n\nThe top-up tax percentage for a fiscal year shall be the positive percentage\n\n(3)\npoint difference, if any, computed in accordance with the following formula:\n\n\f54\n\nTop-up tax percentage = minimum tax rate — effective tax rate\n\nwhere the effective tax rate is the rate computed in accordance with section 29.\n\nThe  excess  profit  for  the  jurisdiction  for  the  fiscal  year  referred  to  in\n(4)\nsubsection (3) shall be the positive amount, if any, computed in accordance with\nthe following formula:\n\nExcess profit = net qualifying income — substance-based income exclusion\n\nwhere the net qualifying income is the net qualifying income or loss determined\nin accordance with section 29(2).\n\nThe top-up tax of a qualifying entity that is part of a DMTT Group for the\n(5)\ncurrent fiscal year shall be computed in accordance with the following formula:\n\nTop-up tax of a qualifying entity = jurisdictional top-up tax\n\nx qualifying income of the qualifying entity\naggregate qualifying income of all qualifying entities\n\nwhere:\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe qualifying income of the qualifying entity for a fiscal year is the\nincome determined in accordance with Part III;\n\nthe aggregate qualifying income of all qualifying entities for a fiscal\nyear is the sum of the qualifying income of all the qualifying entities\nfor the fiscal year.\n\nIf the top-up tax results from a recomputation pursuant to section 32(1)\n(6)\nand (2) and there is no net qualifying income in the jurisdiction for the fiscal year,\nthe top-up tax shall be allocated to each qualifying entity using the formula set\n\n\f55\n\nout in subsection (5), based on the qualifying income of the qualifying entities\nin the fiscal years for which the recomputations pursuant to section 32(1) and (2)\nare performed.\n\nThe top-up tax of each stateless constituent entity shall be computed, for\n(7)\neach fiscal year, separately from the top-up tax of all other constituent entities.\n\nSubstance-based income exclusion\n\n31.(1)\nUnless a filing entity of MNE group elects, in accordance with section\n44, not to apply the substance-based income exclusion for the fiscal year, the net\nqualifying  income  for  a  jurisdiction  shall  be  reduced,  for  the  purpose  of\ncomputing the top-up tax, by an amount equal to the sum of the payroll carve-\nout referred to in subsection (2) and the tangible asset carve-out referred to

entity shall not\n(9)\nbe  reduced  by  the  amount  of  qualifying  losses  that  already  reduced  the\nundistributed net qualifying income of that investment entity for a previous tested\nyear in application of the subsection (7)(c).\n\nFor the purposes of this section, a deemed distribution shall arise when a\n(10)\ndirect or indirect ownership interest in the investment entity is transferred to an\nentity that does not belong to the MNE group and is equal to the share of the\nundistributed net qualifying income attributable to such ownership interest on\nthe date of such transfer, determined without regard to the deemed distribution.\n\nThe election under subsection (1) shall be made in accordance with section\n\n(11)\n44.\n\nIf the election is revoked, the share of the

qualifying  entities  is  not  otherwise  included  in  the  amount\ndetermined for the purposes of subsection (1)(a), that revenue is to be so included.\n\nSimplified effective tax rate test\n\n63.(1)\nThe  simplified  effective  tax  rate  test  is  met  in  a  fiscal  year  if  the\nsimplified  effective  tax  rate  of  the  qualifying  entities  other  than  investment\nentities
