manner in relation to the\ndata subject;\n\ncollected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further\nprocessed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes;\n\n\f18\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\n(e)\n\n(f)\n\nadequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the\npurposes for which they are processed;\n\naccurate and, where necessary, kept up to date and every reasonable\nstep shall be taken to ensure that personal data that is inaccurate, having\nregard  to  the  purposes  for  which  they  are  processed,  are  erased  or\nrectified without delay;\n\nkept  in  a  form  which  permits  identification  of  data  subjects  for  no\nlonger than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data\nis processed; and\n\nprocessed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal\ndata, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing\nand against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate\ntechnical or organisational measures.\n\nA data controller shall, in relation to all of the personal data he processes,\n\n(2)\ncomply with the requirements set out in subsection (1).\n\nA  data  controller  may  specify  the  purpose  for  which  personal  data  is\n\n(3)\nobtained pursuant to subsection 1(b)\n\n(a)\n\nin  any  notice  given  for  the  purposes  of  section  5(3)(a)  by  the  data\ncontroller to the data subject; or\n\n(b)\n\nin a notification given to the Commissioner pursuant to Part III.\n\nIn determining whether any disclosure of personal data is compatible with\n(4)\nthe purpose for which the data is obtained in accordance with subsection 1(b),\nregard is to be had to the purpose for which the personal data is intended to be\nprocessed by any person to whom the data is disclosed.\n\n\f19\n\n(5)\nSubsection 1(d) is not contravened by reason of any inaccuracy in personal\ndata which accurately record information obtained by the data controller from\nthe data subject or a third party in a case where\n\n(a)\n\nhaving  regard  to  the  purpose  for  which  the  data  was  obtained  and\nfurther  processed,  the  data  controller  has  taken  reasonable  steps  to\nensure the accuracy of the data; and\n\n(b)\n\nthe data subject has notified the data controller of the data subject’s\nview that the data is inaccurate and the data indicates that fact.\n\nPursuant  to  subsection  1(f),  having  regard  to  the  state  of  technological\n(6)\ndevelopment  and  the  cost  of  implementing  any  measures,  the  measures

evidenced in writing; and\n\n(ii)\n\nunder which the data processor is to act only on instructions from\nthe data controller; and\n\n(b)\n\nthe  contract  requires  the  data  processor  to  comply

to\n5.(1)\nbe had to the method by which it is obtained, including in particular whether any\nperson from whom the personal data is obtained is deceived or misled as to the\npurpose or purposes for which the personal data is to be processed.\n\nSubject  to  subsection  (3),  personal  data  is  to  be  treated  as  having  been\n(2)\nobtained fairly if the personal data consists of information obtained from a person\nwho is\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nauthorised by or under any enactment to supply the data; or\n\nrequired  to  supply  by  the  data  any  convention  or  other  instrument\nimposing an international obligation on Barbados.\n\n\f21\n\n(3)\n\nPersonal data is not to be treated as processed fairly unless\n\n(a)\n\nin the case of data obtained from the data subject, the data controller\nensures so far as practicable that the data subject has, is provided with,\nor has readily available to him, the following information:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\nthe identity of the data controller;\n\nwhere a data controller has nominated a representative for the\npurposes of this Act, the identity of that representative;\n\nthe  purpose  or  purposes  for  which  the  data  is  intended  to  be\nprocessed; and\n\nany further information which is necessary, having regard to the\nspecific circumstances in which the data is or is to be processed,\nto enable processing in respect of the data subject to be fair; and\n\n(b)\n\nin any other case, the data controller ensures so far as practicable that,\nbefore the relevant time or as soon as practicable after that time, the\ndata  subject  is  provided  with,  or  has  readily  available  to  him,  the\ninformation specified in subparagraphs (i) to (iv) of paragraph (a).\n\n(4)\n\nFor the purposes of subsection (3)(b), “the relevant time” means\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe time when the data controller first processes the data; or\n\nin  a  case  where  at  that  time  disclosure  to  a  third  party  within  a\nreasonable period is envisaged,\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\nif the data is in fact disclosed to such a person within that period,\nthe time when the data is first disclosed;\n\nif  within  that  period  the  data  controller  becomes,  or  ought  to\nbecome aware that the data is unlikely to be disclosed to such a\nperson within that period, the time when the data controller does\nbecome, or ought to become, so aware; or\n\n(iii)\n\nin any other case, the end of that period.\n\n\f22\n\nLawfulness of processing\n\n6.(1)\n\nProcessing shall be lawful where\n\n(a)\n\nthe data subject has given consent to the processing of his personal data\nfor one or more specific purposes; or\n\n(b)\n\nthe processing is necessary\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\nfor the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a\nparty;\n\nfor the taking of steps at the request of the data subject with a\nview to entering into a contract;\n\nfor  compliance  with  any  legal  obligation  to  which  the  data\ncontroller  is  subject,  other  than  an  obligation  imposed  by\ncontract;\n\n(iv)\n\nin order to protect the vital interests of the data subject;\n\n(v)\n\nfor the administration of justice;\n\n(vi)\n\nfor the exercise of any functions of either House of Parliament;\n\n(vii)\n\nfor the exercise of any functions conferred on any person by or\nunder any enactment;\n\n(viii)\n\nfor the exercise of any functions of a public authority;\n\n(ix)\n\n(x)\n\nfor  the  purposes  of  legitimate  interests  pursued  by  the  data\ncontroller or by the third party to whom the data is disclosed,\nexcept  where  the  processing  is  unwarranted  in  any  particular\ncase  by  reason  of  prejudice  to  the  rights  and  freedoms  or\nlegitimate interests of the data subject; or\n\nprocessing  is  necessary  for  the  purposes  of  the  legitimate\ninterests pursued by the data controller or by a third party, except\nwhere  such  interests  are  overridden  by  the  interests  or\nfundamental  rights  and  freedoms  of  the  data  subject  which\n\n\f23\n\nrequire protection of personal data, in particular where the data\nsubject is a child.\n\nSubsection (1)(b)(x) shall not apply to processing carried out by public\n\n(2)\nauthorities in the performance of their tasks.\n\nConditions for consent\n\nWhere  processing  is  based  on  consent,  the  data  controller  shall\n7.(1)\ndemonstrate that the data subject has consented to processing of his personal data.\n\nWhere  the  data  subject's  consent  is  given  in  the  context  of  a  written\n(2)\ndeclaration which also concerns other matters, the request for consent shall be\npresented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the other matters, in\nan intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.\n\nA  data  subject  has  the  right  to  withdraw  his  consent  in  respect  of  the\n(3)\nprocessing of his personal data at any time and the data controller shall inform\nthe data subject of his right to withdraw prior to him giving consent to the data\ncontroller to process his personal data.\n\nThe  withdrawal  of  consent  by  the  data  subject  shall  not  affect  the\n\n(4)\nlawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.\n\nIn determining whether consent is freely given, the data controller shall\n(5)\ntake into account whether the performance of a contract, including the provision\nof a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of personal data that is\nnot necessary for the performance of that contract.\n\nConditions applicable to child's consent\n\n8.(1)\nThe processing of a child’s personal data shall be lawful only where\nand to the extent that consent is given or authorised by the parent or guardian of\nthe child.\n\nThe data controller shall make reasonable efforts to verify in such cases\n(2)\nthat consent is given or authorised by the parent or guardian of a child, taking\ninto consideration available technology.\n\n\f24\n\nSubsection (1) shall not affect contract law under any enactment in respect\n\n(3)\nof the validity, formation or effect of a contract in relation to a child.\n\nProcessing of sensitive personal data\n\n9.(1)\n\nProcessing of sensitive personal data shall be prohibited unless\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe data subject gives his consent to the processing;\n\nthe processing is necessary for the purposes of exercising or performing\nany right or obligation which is conferred or imposed by law on the\ndata controller in connection with employment;\n\n(c)\n\nthe processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the\ndata subject or another person, in a case where\n\n(i)\n\nconsent cannot be given by or on behalf of the data subject; or\n\n(ii)\n\nthe  data  controller  cannot  reasonably  be  expected  to  obtain  the\nconsent of the data subject;\n\n(d)\n\nthe  processing  is  necessary  in  order  to  protect  the  vital  interests  of\nanother person, in a case where consent by or on behalf of the data\nsubject has been unreasonably withheld;\n\n(e)\n\nthe processing\n\n(i)\n\nis carried out in the course of its legitimate activities by any body\nor association which\n\n(A)\n\nis not established or conducted for profit; and\n\n(B)\n\nexists  for  political,  philosophical,  religious  or  trade  union\npurposes;\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\nis  carried  out  with  appropriate  safeguards  for  the  rights  and\nfreedoms of data subjects;\n\nrelates only to individuals who either are members of the
