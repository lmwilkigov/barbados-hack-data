reversed.\n\nDeductive value\n\nWhere the imported goods or identical or similar imported goods are\n64.(1)\nsold in Barbados in the condition as imported, the customs value of the imported\ngoods under this section shall be based on the unit price at which the imported\ngoods or identical or similar imported goods are so sold in the greatest aggregate\nquantity, at or about the time of the importation of the goods being valued, to\npersons  who  are  not  related  to  the  persons  from  whom  they  buy  such  goods,\nsubject to deductions for the

in Barbados in\nthe condition as imported at the earliest date after the importation of the goods\nbeing valued but before the expiration of 90 days after such importation.\n\nWhere neither the imported goods nor identical nor similar imported goods\n(3)\nare sold in Barbados in the condition as imported, if the importer so requests, the\ncustoms value shall be based on the unit price at which the imported goods, after\nfurther  processing,  are  sold  in  the  greatest  aggregate  quantity  to  persons  in\nBarbados who are not related to the persons from whom they buy such goods,\ndue  allowance  being  made  for  the  value  added  by  such  processing  and  the\ndeductions provided for in subsection (1).\n\nComputed value\n\n65.\non a computed value which shall

in producing the imported goods;\n\nan  amount  for  profit  and  general  expenses  equal  to  that  usually\nreflected in sales of goods of the same class or kind as the goods being\nvalued which

value shall be determined under this section on the basis of\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nthe selling price in Barbados of goods produced in another country;\n\na system which provides for the acceptance, for customs purposes, of\nthe higher of two alternative values;\n\nthe price of goods on the domestic market of the country of exportation;\n\nthe cost of production other than computed values which have been\ndetermined for identical or similar goods in accordance with section\n65;\n\n(e)\n\nthe price of the goods for export to a country other than Barbados;\n\n(f)\n\nminimum customs values; or\n\n(g)\n\narbitrary or fictitious values.\n\nWhere the importer so requests, the importer shall be informed in writing\n(3)\nof  the  customs  value  determined  under  this  section  and  the  method  used  to\ndetermine such value.\n\nProvisional customs value by importer\n\n67.(1)\nAn importer may include a provisional customs value in an entry for\nimported goods where the customs value of the imported goods would have been\ndetermined under the transaction value method but for the fact that at the time\nthe entry was made, any adjustments that were required to be made could not\n\n\f73\n\nhave been made because of a lack of sufficient information or under an approval\ngiven by the Comptroller in such circumstances as may be prescribed.\n\nA provisional customs value shall be a reasonable estimate of the customs\n(2)\nvalue  of  the  imported  goods  based  on  the  information  that  is  available  to  the\nimporter at the time the entry is made.\n\nUntil the final customs value is provided, the provisional customs value\n\n(3)\nshall be treated as the customs value for the purposes of this Act.\n\nAn  approval  subject  to  any  terms,  conditions  or  restrictions  by  the\n\n(4)\nComptroller may be required.\n\nReasons to doubt the truth or accuracy of particulars or documents\n\nWhere  a  customs  declaration  is  presented  and  the

explanation,  including  documents  or  other  evidence,  that  the  declared\nvalue represents the total amount actually paid or payable for the imported goods,\nadjusted in accordance with section 60.\n\nWhere, after receiving further information, or in the absence of a response,\n(2)\nthe  Comptroller  still  has  reasonable  doubt  about  the  truth  or  accuracy  of  the\ndeclared  value,  the  Comptroller  may  presume  that  the  customs  value  of  the\nimported goods cannot be determined under section 59.\n\nThe Comptroller shall, before taking a final decision, communicate to the\n(3)\nimporter, in writing if requested, the grounds for doubting the truth or accuracy\nof  the  particulars  or  documents  produced;  and  the  importer  shall  be  given  an\nopportunity to be heard.\n\nWhere a final decision is made, the Comptroller shall communicate to the\n\n(4)\nimporter in writing his decision and the grounds therefor.\n\n\f74\n\nRevised customs value\n\nWhere the Comptroller is satisfied that the customs value of imported\n69.\ngoods in an entry is incorrect, the Comptroller may revise the customs value and\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe revised value shall be treated as the customs value for the purposes\nof this Act; and\n\nthe Comptroller shall notify the importer of the revised value and the\nbasis  for  the  calculation,  including  the  findings  of  fact,  and  of  the\nreasons for the decision and of the rights of the importer to review and\nappeal against the decision.\n\nValue of goods for export\n\n70.\n\nThe customs value of goods for export shall\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nbe the value of the goods at the point of exit; and\n\nbe determined by adding to the exporter’s ex-warehouse price of the\ngoods, the cost of transport and all incidental expenses up to the time\nof export, not including export duties, taxes, fees and charges for which\nthe exporter has been granted a waiver in such circumstances as may\nbe prescribed.\n\nPART
