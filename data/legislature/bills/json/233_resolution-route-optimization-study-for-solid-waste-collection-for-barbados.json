The  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Drainage  (MED)  of\n\nBarbados, Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and Export-Import Bank of Korea (KEXIM)\n\nagreed  to  proceed  with  a  KSP-IDB  Joint  Consulting  Project  to  study  route  optimization  and  to\n\ndetermine  the  improvement  points  for  the  solid  waste  collection  and  management  process  in\n\nBarbados.\n\nThis  report  provides  the  details  of  the  results  of  the  Consulting  Project  called  the\n\n“Consultancy  for  the  Development  of  Route  Optimization  Study  in  Solid  Waste  Collection  in\n\nBarbados”.    During the first mission trip for the Project, the KSP Consultants conducted As-Is\n\nAnalysis  of  the  current  status  and  environment  of  solid  waste  collection,  disposal  and\n\nmanagement  in  Barbados.    From  the  As-Is  Analysis  and analysis  of  case  studies  in  Korea,  the\n\nKSP  Consultants  determined  improvement  points  for  solid  waste  collection,  disposal  and\n\nmanagement  in  Barbados  in  terms  of  process  improvements,  system  improvements,  and\n\nequipment improvements.\n\nA  Dissemination  Seminar  was  conducted  in  Barbados  with  the  key  stakeholders  in  order  to\n\npresent  the  findings  of  the  report  and  to  discuss  the  improvement  points  in  more  detail.    The\n\nDissemination Seminar was attended by the representatives from the IDB, Project Management\n\nCoordination Unit (PMCU), Sanitation Services Authority (SSA) and Environmental Protection\n\nAgency.    The  suggestions  and  comments  raised  during  the  Dissemination  Seminar  were\n\nincorporated into the final report and presented during the Capacity Building Workshop (CBW)\n\nwhich was also held in Barbados.    Representatives for nine (9) neighboring Caribbean countries\n\nwere  invited  to  attend  the  CBW  to  present  their  current  status  and  future  plans  for  solid  waste\n\ncollection and management in their respective countries as well as discuss future needs and plans\n\nfor the whole Caribbean region.\n\n3\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\fI.  Project Overview\n\n### 1.  Project Background and Objectives\n\n##### 1.1. Project Background\n\nSince  2004,  the  Ministry  of  Strategy  and  Finance  of  Korea  had  been  initiating  and\n\nsponsoring the KSP (Knowledge Sharing Program) with the Export-Import Bank of Korea as\n\nits  execution  agency.    Every  year  more  than  10  KSP  Consulting  Projects  are  executed  in\n\nvarious underdeveloped countries in diverse fields and industries where Korea’s knowledge\n\nand experience in the diverse fields and industries are shared with the recipient countries in\n\norder to help the recipient countries leap-frog to the next level of advancement without going\n\nthrough  the  pains  and  mistakes  that  might  arise  through  trial-and-error  processes.    The\n\neconomies  of  the  recipient  countries  will  also  be  able  to  grow  and  prosper  through  the\n\nknowledge gained from the KSP Consulting Projects.\n\nIn  Barbados,  increased  consumption, construction  and  other development  activities  had\n\nresulted  in  increased  rates  of  waste  and  recyclable  generation.    In  2008,  Barbados\n\nconstructed  the  Sustainable  Barbados  Recycling  Center  (SBRC)  to  properly  manage  the\n\ncollection  and  disposal  of  waste.    Barbados  is  putting  a  lot  of  effort  and  resources  into\n\nimproving  the  collection,  processing,  disposal  and  management  of  solid  waste  in  order  to\n\nbetter serve residents and visitors.    The Ministry of Environment and Drainage (MED), IDB\n\nand  KEXIM  agreed  to  proceed  with  a  KSP-IDB  Joint  Consulting  Project  to  study  route\n\noptimization and to determine the improvement points for the solid waste collection process\n\nand systems in Barbados.\n\nIn 2014 Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) sponsored the Caribbean Conference\n\non  Solid  Waste  Management  in  Jamaica  and  the  Conference  was  attended  by  the\n\nrepresentatives  from  some  countries  in  the  Caribbean  and  Central  America.    Presentations\n\nwere  made  by  individual  countries  to  explain  the  current  status  and  future  plans  for  solid\n\nwaste management in their countries.    To continue the practice, IDB and KEXIM (Export-\n\nImport  Bank  of  Korea)  agreed  to  conduct  a  similar  conference  in  Barbados  in  2015  as  a\n\n4\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\fCapacity Building Workshop where representatives from some neighboring countries along\n\nwith  Barbados  were  able  to  present  the  current  status  and  future  plans  for  solid  waste\n\ncollection  and  management  in  their  respective  countries.    In  addition,  IDB  and  KEXIM\n\nshared the results of this Consulting Project, including the Best Practices and case studies in\n\nKorea,  with  the  representatives  from  the  other  neighboring  countries  who  attended  the\n\nCapacity  Building  Workshop  in  order  for  all  participants  to  share  ideas  and  direction  for\n\nadvancements in processes and systems related to solid waste collection in the region.\n\n##### 1.2. Project Objectives\n\nThe  Consulting  Project’s  main  objective  was  to  conduct  a  route  optimization  study  for\n\nsolid waste collection in Barbados.    Currently in Barbados, there are a number of problems\n\nthat  are  arising  due  to  inefficient  solid  waste  collection  such  as  stacking  of  solid  waste\n\nwaiting to be picked up, illegal dumping of solid waste, and others.    The Consulting Project\n\nproposed solutions and alternatives to solving the current problems and issues related to solid\n\nwaste  collection  and  management  in  order  to  make  the  solid  waste  collection  and\n\nmanagement activities more efficient and standardized.\n\n### 2.  Scope of Works\n\n##### 2.1. Main Areas of Focus\n\n#########   Solid waste collection process is not a stand-alone process that can be analyzed and\n\nmanaged independently; therefore, recycling process and solid waste disposal process\n\nwill be included in the overall analysis and study.\n\n#########   Hazardous waste collection was not included in this study where “hazardous waste” is\n\ndefined  as  1)  characteristic  waste  which  are  materials  that  are  known  or  tested  to\n\nexhibit  one  or  more  of  the  following  four  hazardous  traits:  ignitability,  reactivity,\n\ncorrosivity,  and/or  toxicity  and  2)  listed  hazardous  wastes  which  are  materials\n\nspecifically listed by regulatory authorities as a hazardous waste which are from non-\n\nspecific sources, specific sources, or discarded chemical products.\n\n5\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\f  This study concentrated on residential waste with some consideration of commercial\n\nwaste while industrial waste was not covered..\n\n##### 2.2. Project Implementation Plan\n\nThe  Consulting  Project  was  executed  in  four  stages  :  Preparation  and  As-Is  Analysis\n\nStage, Case Study and Recommendation Stage, Dissemination Seminar Stage, and Capacity\n\nBuilding Workshop Stage.\n\n#### Table I-1 | Stages of Execution\n\nStage  Duration\n\nActivity\n\nDeliverables\n\n1\n\n2015. 8. 1\n~ 10. 15\n\n######### •  Preparation and As-Is Analysis Stage\n: Research of relevant materials\n: Preparation of Mission Trip\n: Finalization of Project Implementation Plan\n: Inception Mission to Barbados\n  (Oct. 8 ~ Oct. 15)\n\n######### •  Inception Report/\n\nProject\nImplementation Plan\n\n######### •  Mission Plan •  Mission Report\n\n2\n\n2015. 10. 16\n~ 11. 15\n\n3\n\n2015. 11.1\n~ 11.30\n\n######### •  Case Study and Recommendations Stage\n: Study of Best Practices and case study of solid\nwaste collection in Korea\n: Determination of improvement points and\nrecommendations for solid waste collection in\nBarbados\n: Invitation of participants to Capacity Building\nWorkshop in Barbados\n\n######### •  Dissemination Seminar Stage\n: Presentation of final finding of the study to all\nstakeholders in Barbados\n: Preparation of Workshop and mission trip\n: Execution of Seminar in Barbados\n(Nov. 16 ~ 18)\n\n•  Interim Report\n\n######### •  Mission Plan •  Mission Report\n\n4\n\n2015. 12. 1\n~ 12. 30\n\n######### •  Capacity Building Workshop Stage\n: Planning and preparation of Workshop\n: Execution of Workshop in Barbados\n(Dec. 7 ~ Dec. 11)\n\n######### •  Materials for\nWorkshop\n######### •  Mission Plan •  Final Report\n\n6\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\f2.3.

Analysis of Current Status\n\n### 1.  Law and Policy in Barbados\n\n##### 1.1.   Organization\n\nThe main organization concerning solid waste management in Barbados is the Ministry\n\nof  Environment  and  Drainage  (MED)  and  the  MED  is  responsible  for  developing  and\n\nexecuting  the  law,  regulation  and  policies  related  to  solid  waste  collection,  disposal  and\n\nmanagement.    Under the MED, there are three main departments who are involved in solid\n\nwaste  management  and  they  are  the  Project  Management  Coordination  Unit  (PMCU),\n\nSanitation  Services  Authority  (SSA)  and  the  Environmental  Protection  Department  (EPD)\n\n(Please refer to Figure II-1 on the next page).    PMCU is responsible for the implementation\n\nof  the  Integrated  Solid  Waste  Management  Programme  (ISWMP)  and  they  are  the  main\n\ncounterpart  organization  for  this  Consulting  project.    SSA  is  a  quasi-government  agency\n\nresponsible  for  the  collection  and  disposal  of  solid  waste.    EPD  is  responsible  for  the\n\nregulation, enforcement and monitoring of the laws related to solid waste collection, disposal,\n\nand management.    The Environmental Health Department (EHD) works in conjunction with\n\nthe  EPD;  however,  EHD  is  not  part  of  the  MED  but  under  the  Ministry  of  Health.    The\n\nSustainable Barbados Recycling Center (SBRC) is a PPP (Public Private Partnership) where\n\nthe  SSA  reimburses  SBRC  for  some  of  the  services  SBRC  provide  such  as  1)  automatic\n\nweighing  of  collection  trucks  as  the  trucks  enter  and  leave  SBRC,  2)  acting  as  a  transfer\n\nstation where wastes are unloaded and separated prior to the delivery to the landfill, and 3)\n\nrecycling of the waste that are unloaded by the collection trucks.\n\nThere  are  around  12  private  companies  involved  in  solid  waste  collection  and\n\nmanagement  and  the  three  largest  are  Simpson Trucking  and  Skip  Services, Jose and Jose,\n\nand Garbage Master.    There are also some companies involved in recycling paper, plastic,\n\nglass,  metal,  etc.  and  the  three  largest  are  B’  Recycling,  Ace  Recycling  and  Scrap  Man.\n\nOther  than  the  recycling  companies,  all  the  private  haulers  also  take  their  collected  solid\n\nwaste to the SBRC to be processed and reside disposed of at the landfill.\n\n13\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\fFigure II-1 | Organizational Chart of Solid Waste Management in Barbados\n\n•  Yellow: Public Sector\n\n•  Pink: Private Sector\n\n•  Blue: Role\n\n##### 1.2. Solid Waste Related Law and Policy\n\nThe main laws related to solid waste is the “Waste Management Act”(draft version) and\n\nthe  “Licensing  Relations”  related  to  the  execution  of  the  law.    Other  related  laws  are  the\n\nSanitary Service Act, Health Service Act, Town and Country Planning Act, Marine Pollution\n\nAct and the Coastal Zone Management Act.\n\nThe  main  policy  related  to  solid  waste  is  the  Integrated  Solid  Waste  Management\n\nProgramme  (ISWMP)  which  was  started  in  1993.    There  were  many  revisions  and\n\namendments  to  the  ISWMP  since  1993  and  it  is also  a  major  part  of  the  government-wide\n\nBarbados Sustainable Development Policy (BSDP) which was launched in 2004.\n\nSolid waste characterization studies are also performed every ten years (1994 and 2005)\n\nand  Barbados  is  currently  undergoing  the  latest  study  where  the  draft  version  of  the  study\n\nwas received and was reviewed.    In the “National Strategic Plan of Barbados 2005~2024”,\n\nMajor  Target  4  deals  with  “Strengthening  the  Physical  Infrastructure  and  Preserving  the\n\nEnvironment”  where  solid  waste  management  is  outlined  as  one  of  the  key  issues  that  the\n\nGovernment of Barbados (GOB) will be focusing on for the next 25 years.\n\n14\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\fLater,  with  the  emergence  of  national  waste  management  as  an  international\n\nenvironmental issue, Barbados established the 1993 Health Sector Development Plan and the\n\nISWMP  is  currently  being  implemented  as  part  of  this  Plan.    The  ISWMP  focuses  on\n\nvarious stakeholders from both the public and private sectors working together to change the\n\nexisting bad practices of illegal disposal of wastes, to minimize the disposal of solid waste,\n\nto  promote  recycling,  and  to  provide  guidance  to  convert  solid  wastes  into  resources.    By\n\npresenting a long term vision for solid waste management for the next 20 years, the goal of\n\nthe ISWMP is to develop a modern and sustainable management system that is efficient and\n\nreliable  in  order  to  effectively  manage  the  solid  waste  disposal  throughout  Barbados  and\n\nprotect the environment.\n\nThe objectives of the ISWMP can be categorized into three parts.    The first objective is\n\nto  reduce  the  disease  and  environmental  contamination  from  wastes  resulting  from  illegal\n\ndisposal  and  existing  bad  disposal  practices.    The  second  objective  is  to  improve  the\n\nsanitation standards of Barbados by developing and providing an efficient and reliable solid\n\nwaste  management  system,  and  the  third  objective  is  to  provide  programs  to  promote\n\nawareness  and  educate  the  public  in  order  for  the  citizens  of  Barbados  to  manage  the\n\nenvironment on their own.    The participation of the private sector stakeholders in the solid\n\nwaste management system, and the reduction of volume and toxicity of the solid wastes are\n\nalso included in the third objective (PAHO, 2003).\n\nThe  ISWMP  is  composed  of  physical  elements  and  non-physical  elements.    Physical\n\nelements  are  the  facilities  such  as  the  landfills,  solid  waste  management  depots,  and  large\n\nwaste  disposal  facilities.    The  solid  waste disposal  depots  should include transfer  stations,\n\nmaterials  recovery  facilities,  chemical  waste  storage  facilities,  and  composting  facilities.\n\nAdditionally, improving the roads to effectively transport the wastes to the disposal facilities\n\nare also included in this element (PAHO, 2003).\n\nThe  non-physical  elements  of  the  ISWMP  are  reinforcing  the  solid  waste  management\n\nsystem by establishing organizational and advisory groups, who can implement all aspects of\n\nthe solid waste disposal process and can supervise the status of progression of the ISWMP.\n\nDeveloping  policies  and  laws  related  to  improving  solid  waste  disposal,  increasing  public\n\nawareness  and  providing  educational  programs  on  the  importance  of  solid  waste\n\nmanagement  for  various  stakeholders  such  as  employees  of  major  governmental  agencies,\n\nsemi-governmental organizations and private waste collection companies are all considered\n\n15\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\fto  be  non-physical  elements  as  well.    Furthermore,  looking  for  more  economical  ways  to\n\nrecoup  the  solid  waste  management  expenses  are  also  included  in  this  category  (PAHO,\n\n2003).\n\n#### Table II-1 | Summary of ISWMP\n\nCategory\n\nDetails\n\nProgram Name\n\nIntegrated Solid Waste Management Program (ISWMP)\n\nStart Date\n\nTemporary Stat Date : 1993\n\nActual Start Date: 1995\n\nExecution Agency\n\nProject Management Coordination Unit (PMCU)\n\n- Development of a modern and sustainable solid waste management system\n\nObjective\n\nthat is efficient and reliable.\n\n- Vision for solid waste management for the next 20 years.\n\n- Improve the landfills\n\n- Establish solid waste management depots and large waste disposal facilities\n\n- Improve the road conditions\n\nComposition\n\n- Reinforce the solid waste management system\n\n- Develop policies and laws for solid waste management\n\n- Promote public awareness and operate educational programs on the\n\nimportance of solid waste management\n\n- Find ways to economically recoup the solid waste management expenses\n\nSource: PAHO.

Current Status of Solid Waste Collection in Barbados\n\n##### 2.1. Classification of Waste\n\nThe Waste Management Act does not clearly define the classification of waste; however,\n\ngenerally  the  waste  is  classified  as  1)  Municipal  Solid  Waste  (MSW),  2)  Industrial,\n\nCommercial and Institutional (ICI) or Commercial and Institution (CI), 3) Construction and\n\nDemolition (C&D) waste, and 4) Rock and Soil (R&S).    Another way to classify waste is\n\nby using the content of waste such as 1) garbage or MSW, 2) Green Waste (GW), 3) C&D\n\nand 4) R&S.    The “Characterization Study 2005” classified waste as 1) Residential Refuse\n\n2)  Residential  Yard  Waste,  3)  Commercial  Refuse,  4)  Commercial  Yard  Waste,  5)  Bulky\n\nWaste,  6)  Hazardous  Waste,  7)  Special  Liquid  Waste,  and  8)  Imported  Waste.    The\n\ndefinition of waste is currently being undertaken in the revised policy.\n\nSince there is no classification of waste defined in the Waste Management Act, there is\n\nalso no waste code (number) associated with the different waste classifications.    Waste code\n\nis  very  important  in  the  management  of  waste;  therefore,  the  waste  codes  defined  in  the\n\ncharacterization  studies  are  currently  being  used  to  manage  the  different  types  of  waste.\n\nWe can see a continuous increase in the number of classifications of waste (thus, the number\n\nof  waste  codes)  from  the  initial  characterization  study  performed  in  1995  which  had  34\n\nclasses  to  the  latest  study  performed  in  2015  which  has  52  classes.    Currently,  codes  1~8\n\nclassifies paper and cardboard, codes 9~13 classifies glass, codes 14~21 metal, codes 22~28\n\nplastic, codes 29~30 textile, codes 37~42 construction waste, codes 43~48 special care waste\n\nand codes 49~52 other waste.    The different codes define the different methods of recycling\n\nand processing of the waste which is a very efficient coding system.    The waste codes can\n\nalso be used as keys to identify the different types of waste in a computer system.\n\n##### 2.2. Production of Waste\n\nUsually the increase in waste production is linked with the increase in population and the\n\nincrease  in  income.    However,  in  Barbados,  there  is  minimal  increase  in  population;\n\ntherefore, the yearly increase in waste production is linked to the increase in GDP.    Before\n\n2001, the yearly increase in waste production was only 3%; however, from 2001 to 2010, the\n\n17\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\fyearly increase rose to over 11% which is directly linked to the large increase in GDP during\n\nthis period.    Then after 2010, the yearly increase has fallen back to the 3% level.\n\nThe sum of MSW production and GW production was 150 tons per day in 2001, then in\n\n2010 the amount increased to 400 tons per day and in 2014, the amount has increased to 450\n\ntons per day.    450 tons per day translates to 1.68 kg of waste produced per person every day.\n\nThe  average  waste  production  for  advanced  countries  is  about  1  kg  per  person  per  day  so\n\nBarbados’s waste production is much higher than the average and we can assume two main\n\nreasons for this higher amount.    One is because tourism is one of Barbados’ main industries\n\nand the second is due to the large amount of GW produced.\n\nThe  total  sum  of  all  waste  produced,  including  MSW,  GW,  C&D  and  R&S,  is  about\n\n1,000 tons per day (300 tons per day for MSW, 150 tons per day for GW, 150 tons per day\n\nfor C&D, and 400 tons per day for R&S).    Table II-2 shows the amount of waste received\n\nby SBRC for the last 5 years.    You can see that the total amount of waste received by the\n\nSBRC  has  increased  continuously  for  the  last  5  years.    The  waste  collected  by  SSA\n\naccounts for about 21.7% of the total (78,703 tons out of a total 360,526 tons) and you can\n\nnotice that the amount of waste collected by SSA stays rather constant between 77,000 tons\n\nto 83,000 tons per year for the last 5 years which means that the population is not increasing\n\nvery much.    The main increase in the total amount of waste comes from the private haulers,\n\nmeaning that the increase in waste production is due to increase in tourism and businesses.\n\n#### Table II-2 | Waste received by SBRC for the last 5 years (in tons)\n\nCollector\n\nYear\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\nSSA\n\n50,780\n\n81,105\n\n77,195\n\n83,921\n\n78,703\n\nPrivate\n\n157,855\n\n162,488\n\n220,214\n\n271,114\n\n281,823\n\nTotal\n\n208,635\n\n243,593\n\n297,209\n\n355,035\n\n360,526\n\n18\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\f2.3. Composition of Waste\n\nTable II-3 shows the composition of MSW and ICI waste in the latest “Characterization\n\nStudy 2015”.    For MSW, 36% are organic waste with paper, textile and plastic accounting\n\nfor 15%, 11%, and 10%, respectively.    For ICI, 48% are organic waste and 35% are C&D\n\nand these two types of waste account for 83% of all ICI.    Paper, plastic, textile and organic\n\nwaste account for 92% of the overall waste production by households and the remaining 8%\n\nare glass and metal waste.\n\n#### Table II-3 | Composition of Waste (2015)\n\nCategory\n\nMSW\n\nICI\n\nCombined\n\nPaper\n\nPlastic\n\n14.9 %\n\n3.6 %\n\n10.28 %\n\n9.5 %\n\n5.0 %\n\n7.70 %\n\nTextiles\n\n10.9 %\n\n1.7 %\n\n7.16 %\n\nOrganics\n\n36.4 %\n\n47.7 %\n\n41.00 %\n\nGlass\n\nMetal\n\nC&D\n\n3.0 %\n\n3.9 %\n\n9.8 %\n\nspecial care waste\n\n0.2 %\n\nother waste\n\n11.4 %\n\n1.5 %\n\n1.9 %\n\n2.40 %\n\n3.07 %\n\n35.0 %\n\n20.09 %\n\n0.2 %\n\n3.4 %\n\n0.20 %\n\n8.10 %\n\nTotal (%)\n\n100 %\n\n100 %\n\n100 %\n\n92 %\n\n8 %\n\n##### 2.4. Waste Management\n\nThe general waste management process is as follows:\n\n#########   Generation  →  Storage (on-site)  →  Collection  →  Transportation  →  Processing\n\nUsually,  task  of  collection  and  the  task  of  transportation are  separated and executed  by\n\ndifferent companies or organizations.    In this case, collection can be performed using large\n\n19\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\fnon-compactor  trucks  and  the  waste  delivered  to  transfer  stations  where  the  waste  is\n\nseparated and compacted for delivery.    However, in Barbados, due to the small size of the\n\ncountry,  both  collection  and  transportation  are  carried  out  by  the  same  company  or\n\norganization  using  compactor  trucks.    Also,  there  are  no  in-between  transfer  stations\n\nhandling the waste separation prior to delivery to the SBRC.    SBRC can be considered the\n\nonly transfer station prior to the delivery to the landfill.\n\nIn  Barbados  there  are  no  requirements  for  separation  of  recyclable  waste  versus  non-\n\nrecyclable waste.    The only separation of waste done at the households are the separation of\n\ncontainers made of glass, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), or metal since these containers\n\ncan  be  brought  to  recycling  centers  for  exchange  of  money  (based  on  the  Returnable\n\nContainers  Act).    These  recyclable  wastes  account  for  about  20%  of  the  total  waste\n\ngenerated at the households (about 60 tons per day).\n\nThe generated wastes are placed in plastic bags (designated trash bags or regular plastic\n\nbags provided at the markets) and placed at the curb for pick-up.    The plastic bags can just\n\nbe piled on the curb or placed in individual trash bins which can be purchased.    The 60 to\n\n100  liter  trash  bins  are  made  of  plastic  with  holes  drilled  at  the  bottom  to  remove  liquid,\n\nwhich are generated by the waste.    The trash bins make the waste collection easier for the\n\nloaders.    Other  than  households,  skips  can  be  used  to  store  plastic  bags  or  other  trash\n\ngenerated  by  commercial  businesses  or  apartments.    The  Figure  below  shows  the  storage\n\non-site of the generated waste in Barbados.\n\n#### Figure II-2 | Waste Storage On-Site\n\n                    (a) Bag and Bin                                                            (b) Skip Container\n\n20\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\f2.5. Waste Collection\n\nThe  SSA  divides  Barbados  into  5  major  regions  for  waste  collection.    The  regions  are\n\nCity  West,  City  East,  South  West,  South  East  and  North  (shown  in  Figure  II-2  below).\n\nBridgetown,  where  42%  of  the  total  amount  of  waste  is  generated  is  divided  into  two\n\nseparate  regions,  City  West  and  City  East.    In  Barbados,  there  are  3  major  depots  where\n\ncollection trucks are parked and distributed from.    The Wildey Depot is the main depot with\n\nabout 40 trucks (operational or not).    There is a depot in Bridgetown at Reed Street with 1\n\ncompactor truck and 1 skip truck.    Finally, there is a small depot in the North at Greenland\n\nwith 3 trucks.\n\nTable II-4 shows the amount of waste collected by region in 2014.    There were only 4\n\nregions in 2014 where the South was divided into two regions this year.\n\n#### Figure II-3 | Regions for Waste Collection\n\nDepot\n\nDriver\n\nLoader\n\nSouth East\n\nSouth West\n\nNorth\n\nCity West\n\nCity East\n\nCommercials\n\nTotal\n\n10\n\n11\n\n11\n\n16\n\n11\n\n6\n\n65\n\n20\n\n22\n\n22\n\n32\n\n22\n\n12\n\n130\n\n[INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK]\n\n21\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\fTable II-4 | Waste Collection by Region (2014)\n\nCategory\n\nTotal\n\nCity West  City East\n\nSouth\n\nNorth\n\nRegion\n\nNo. of trip\n\n2,822\n\n3,950\n\n4,014\n\n3,523\n\n14,309\n\nTons received\n\n14,565\n\n15,601\n\n23,213\n\n18,267\n\n71,646\n\nTon/trip (average)\n\n5.16\n\n3.95\n\n5.78\n\n5.19\n\n5.00\n\nThe residents bring out their waste to the curb and place the plastic bags on the curb or\n\nput the plastic bags into 60 to 100 liter trash bins.

In  larger  apartments  or  buildings,  skip\n\ncontainer  based  “block  service”  method  of  collection  is  being  used.    In  the  city,  street\n\ncleaners roll along large garbage cans to place sweep the streets as well as collect garbage\n\nfrom  trash  bins  or  directly  from  the  streets.

Waste Processing\n\nThe  waste  processing  in  Barbados  has  a  very  simple  structure.    Recyclable  goods\n\ncollected at the private recycling companies and the SBRC are mostly exported to China or\n\nto South America.    Most of the MSW generated are buried in the Mangrove Pond Landfill\n\nwithout incineration.\n\nFigure  II-4  shows  the  waste  collection,  disposal  and  management  process  in  Barbados\n\ndepending  on  the  classification  of  waste.    About  1,000  tons  of  waste  are  collected  and\n\n23\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\fdelivered to the SBRC every day (MSW 300 tons/day, GW 150 tons/day, C&D 150 tons/day,\n\nand R&S 400 tons/day).    SSA is responsible for collecting about 180 tons of waste per day\n\nand  the  remaining  800+  tons  of  waste  are  being  collected  by  private  companies.    Most  of\n\nthe 1,000 tons of waste collected per day either go to the landfill to be buried (400 tons/day)\n\nor is being used for land reclamation (540 tons/day).    The remaining 60 tons of waste are\n\nbeing recycled; therefore, about 6% of the total amount of waste is being recycled which is\n\nvery low compared to Korea where about 60% of the waste is being recycled.    Recycling is\n\nimportant because it diverts a large amount of waste going to the landfill.\n\n#### Figure II-5 | Waste Processing in Barbados\n\n• Yellow: Public Sector\n\n• Pink: Private Sector\n\n[INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK]\n\n24\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\f3.  Problems and Issues\n\nThe  two  biggest  problems  and  issues  in  waste  collection  in  Barbados  are  1)  collection\n\ntrucks and 2) roads.    In case of collection trucks, the biggest problem is that the trucks and\n\nfacilities are old and outdated.    There should have been a continuous purchasing of at least\n\na small number of trucks every year or every two years; however, in Barbados, large number\n\nof trucks were purchased in 1999, 2005 and 2013 without replenishing fleet in other years.\n\nSince the trucks are old and overworked, there are constant mechanical failures mainly in the\n\ngear, brake, compactor and transmission.    Since 1991, a total of 88 trucks were purchased;\n\nhowever,  currently  there  are  only  41  trucks  that  can  be  used  and  out  of  these  41,  only  15\n\ntrucks  were  operational  during  our  mission  trip.    The  remaining  trucks  were  in  the  shop\n\nwaiting  for  replacements  and  minor  repairs.    Some  trucks  were  completely  unusable  and\n\nsome  were  outside  the  shop  being  worked  on  for  major  repairs  by  outsourced  private\n\ncompanies.    The  percentage  of  operating  trucks  was  far  below  50%  while  in  Korea,  the\n\npercentage of operating trucks was maintained to levels above 85% at all times.

There  are  a  lot  of  roads  with\n\ndead-ends and no turn-around points; thereby, forcing waste collection trucks to back into the\n\ndead-end roads for pickup or make hard almost impossible turns to drive out of roads.    Low\n\nhanging  trees  or  electric  wires  also  pose  problems  to  drivers  and  parked  cars  sometimes\n\nmake it impossible to reach houses in streets with narrow roads.    Other problems that arise\n\nare  that  sometimes  persons  dump  their  waste  into  other  person’s  garbage  lots  or  skips  in\n\norder  to  avoid  payment  for  excessive  discharge.

Case Study on Korea’s Experiences\n\n### 1.  Korean Waste Management Laws and Policies\n\n##### 1.1. Development of the Waste Regulations\n\nThe Waste Management Policy of Korea which started with the ‘Garbage Cleaning Law’\n\nof  the  1960s  has  developed  continuously  through  the  establishment  and  amendment  of  the\n\nrelated  laws  and  regulations.    There  was  a  dual  waste  management  policy  before  1986\n\nbecause residential waste was managed under the ‘Garbage Cleaning  Law’ while industrial\n\nwaste was managed under the ‘Environmental Protection Law’.\n\nIt  is  difficult  to  say  that  both  the  ‘Garbage  Cleaning  Law’  and  the  ‘Environmental\n\nProtection Law’ can be considered real waste management policies, as they only pertained to\n\nthe  cleaning  and  disposing  of  the  wastes  instead  of  managing  them  effectively  and\n\nsystematically.\n\nHowever,  with  the  establishment  of  the  ‘Waste  Management  Law’  in  the  late  1980s,\n\nwaste  management  became  a  single  policy,  and  various  waste  management  policies  and\n\nregulations were established and implemented afterwards.\n\n######### 1)  Establishment of the ‘Garbage Cleaning Law’ (1961~1986)\n\nEstablished in December 1961 and abolished in December 1986, the ‘Garbage Cleaning\n\nLaw’  focused  mainly  on  thoroughly  collecting  and  disposing  of  household  garbage  and\n\nhuman excrements in the cities.    This was closely related to the social situation at the time\n\nwhere  the  neglected  garbage  and  excrements  damaged  the  views  of  the  residential\n\nenvironments and public spaces, and the odors became a serious problem.    Meanwhile, the\n\n‘Garbage  Cleaning  Law’  was  amended in  1973  to include  not  only  household  garbage  and\n\nhuman excrements but other wastes as well.\n\n27\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\f2)  Establishment of the ‘Environmental Protection Law’ (1978~1986)\n\nAs  the  result  of  the  increasing  awareness  for  environmental  contamination  problems  as\n\nthe  result  of  the  increase  in  industrial  wastes  from  industrialization,  the  ‘Environmental\n\nProtection Law’ was established in December 1977 and enforced in January 1978.    With the\n\nimplementation  of  this  law,  the  waste  management  policy  in  Korea  became  a  dual  policy\n\nwhere  residential  wastes  such  as  garbage  and  human  excrements  were  managed  under  the\n\nexisting ‘Garbage Cleaning Law’, while the industrial wastes were managed under the new\n\n‘Environmental Protection Law’.\n\nMeanwhile,  with  the  birth  of  the  Korea  Environmental  Office  in  1980  after  the\n\nestablishment  of  the  ‘Environmental  Protection  Law’,  Korea’s  environmental  policies\n\nbecame  more  assertive.    In  other  words,  if  the  existing  policies  were  considered  more\n\npassive  by  focusing  mainly  on  disposing  (cleaning)  the  wastes  that  were  produced  by\n\nhouseholds  and  industries,  the  policies  after  the  establishment  of  the  Environmental\n\nProtection  Law  became  more  assertive,  seeking  for  directions  to  maintain  a  clean\n\nenvironment.\n\nFurthermore,  in  order  to  reflect  the  social  situation  of  increasing  importance  for\n\nenvironmental  problems,  the  Environmental  Protection  Law  included  more  assertive\n\nsolutions such as the evaluation on the pollutants’ effect on environment, the environmental\n\nstandards  and  contaminant  levels  for  pollutants  instead  of  preventing  and  improving  the\n\nenvironmental pollutions.\n\n######### 3)  The ‘Waste Management Law’ Era (1986~1992)\n\n‘Waste  Management  Law’  was  established  in  December  1986  to  address  the  problems\n\nthat  were  caused  due  to  continuous  increase  of  waste  generation  and  the  rising  public\n\nawareness for the safe treatment and proper management of waste in Korea. Korea’s waste\n\nmanagement  policy  really  developed  with  the  establishment  of  the  “Waste  Management\n\nLaw”.    Under  the  new  ‘Waste  Management  Law’,  the  dual  policy  of  ‘Garbage  Cleaning\n\nLaw’  (residential  waste)  and  ‘Environmental  Protection  Law’  (industrial  waste)  became  a\n\nsingle  policy,  and  the  concept  of  ‘waste  recycling’  was  included  to  accommodate  the\n\nawareness in and the interest to practice recycling.\n\n28\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\fThen in 1991, a newly amended ‘Waste Management Law’ was publically announced to\n\ninclude  such  policies  as  waste  reduction  and  recycling,  waste  collection  and  disposal\n\ndeposits, follow-up management of the waste disposal facilitie.    This was closely related to\n\nthe  need  at  that  time  for  a  policy  that  went  beyond  the  simple  waste  disposal/cleaning\n\nconcept to systematically and efficiently managing the waste from the production, collection,\n\ntransportation, incineration, landfill and recycling stages (Hyung-Gi Ahn, 2010).\n\n######### 4)  Law Separation Era (1993~present)\n\nSince  1993  until  now,  the  unified  Waste  Management  Law  was  segmented  and\n\nrevitalized  into  recycling  and  resource  recirculation  as  well  as  actively  promoting  the\n\ninstallation  of  waste  disposal  facilities  by  incorporating  a  variety  of  laws  and  regulations.\n\nIn  this  regard,  the  ‘Resource  Saving  and  Recycling  Law’  was  established  in  1992  and\n\nenforced  from  1993.    This  law  separated  waste  reduction  and  recycling  from  the  existing\n\n‘Waste  Management  Law’  in  order  to  promote  recycling.    Accordingly,  the  recycling\n\npolicies  and  regulations  such  as  reduction  of  packing  materials,  regulations  on  disposable\n\nproducts, waste disposal deposits and fees, and encouragement of recycling industries were\n\nenforced.\n\nAdditionally,  the  ‘International  Waste  Transport  and  Disposal  Law’  was  established  in\n\n1992 and enforced from 1994 to fulfill the Basel Treaty.    Accordingly, the ‘Waste Disposal\n\nFacility  Installation  and  Local  Support  Law’  was  separated  from  the  ‘Waste  Management\n\nLaw’  in  1995.    The  purpose  of  this  law  is  to  prevent  the  NIMBY  (Not  In  My  Backyard)\n\nsituation towards waste facilities such as incinerators by the local residents by giving them\n\nsupport to solve and mediate any social complications that may arise.\n\nLaws  for  specific  wastes  were  established  in  2003  and  2007.    These  included  the\n\n‘Construction  Waste  Recycling  Law’  of  2003  and  the  ‘Electric  Appliances,  Electronic\n\nProducts,  and  Automobile  Resources  Recirculation  Law’  of  2007.    In  particular,  the\n\n‘Electric  and  Electronic  Products,  and  Automobiles  Resource  Recirculation  Law’  was\n\nintroduced  for  the  resource  recirculation  concept  and  the  product  resource  recirculation\n\nevaluation.\n\nMeanwhile,  the  ‘Standardized  Garbage  Bag  System’  and  the  ‘Forbidding  of  Food\n\nGarbage  Accumulation  and  Landfill  Ban’  were  enforced  in  1995  and  2005  respectively  to\n\nreduce waste, promote separate collection through recycling, and recover resources.\n\n29\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\f1.2. Main Waste Laws\n\nThe  main  waste  laws  of  Korea  began  with  the  ‘Waste  Management  Law’  in  1986  and\n\ndeveloped  through  the  ‘Resource  Saving  and  Recycling  Law’  and  the  ‘International  Waste\n\nTransport  and  Disposal  Law’  in  1994,  the  ‘Waste  Disposal  Facility  Installation  and  Local\n\nSupport  Law’  in  1995,  and  then  the  ‘Electric  Appliances,  Electronic  Products,  and\n\nAutomobile Resources Recirculation Law’ in 2007.\n\n#### Table III-1 | Main Waste Laws\n\nYear of\nEstablishment\n1986\n\n1992\n\n1994\n\n1995\n\n2007\n\nName of Law\n\nDetails\n\n•  Waste Controls Act\n\n•  Act on the Promotion of\nSaving and Recycling of\nResources\n\n######### •  Act on the Control of\n\nCross Border\nTransportation of\nHazardous Waste and\n\n•  Their Disposal\n\n•  Act on the Promotion of\nthe Installation of Waste\nDisposal Facilities and\nAssistance in Adjacent\nAreas\n\n- Suppress waste production\n- Usage of eco-friendly disposable methods\n\n- Suppress waste production and promote recycling\n- Promote recirculation of resources\n\n- Regulate the importing, exporting and transiting of\n\nwastes to fulfill the ‘Basel Treaty on the\nRestriction of International Transport and Disposal\nof Hazardous Wastes’\n\n- Prevent environmental contamination from\n\ninternational transportation of wastes and promote\ninternational cooperation\n\n- Secure land for waste disposal facilities and\n\nsupport local residents\n\n- Build waste disposal facilities without problems\n\nand improve the welfare of the residents\n\n######### •  Act on the Resource`\n\nCirculation of Electrical\nand Electronic Equipment\nand Vehicle\n\n- Promote the recycling of electric appliances,\n\nelectronic products and automobiles by\nsuppressing the use of hazardous wastes, making\nfor easy re-usage, and appropriate recycling\n- Construct a resource recirculation system for\n\nefficient resource usage\n\nSource: Anh. (2010).  Improvement Direction of the Waste Management Policy  – Construction of an\n\nInter-Governmental  Cooperative  Governance  System.  Korea  Local  Government  Society\n\nBulletin”, Vol. 22, No. 4\n\nWith  the  amendment  of  the  'Waste  Management  Law'  in  1995,  waste  was  divided  into\n\nresidential  waste  and  commercial  waste.    The  'Waste  Management  Law’  was  amended  in\n\n2007 to introduce the ‘Electronic Transfer and Takeover System’, and made it obligatory to\n\n30\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\freport the details of the wastes in order to strengthen and simplify the management process,\n\nand  make  it  transparent.    Accordingly,  each  time a  business  produces,  collects,  transports,\n\nrecycles or disposes of wastes, all data relating to the transfer and takeover of the process has\n\nto be inputted in the electronic information processing program.    Furthermore, if a business\n\nexports or imports wastes, information such as type, quantity, and disposal plans have to be\n\nreported  to  the  Minister  of  Environment.    Therefore,  if  one  type  of  waste  is  imported  or\n\nexported, the type, quantity, and disposal plans of the concerned waste must be reported to\n\nthe Minister of Environment.\n\nThe 'Waste Management Law' was amended again recently and publically announced in\n\nJuly  2015,  to  be  enforced  in  July  2016.    The  main  purpose  of  the  amendment  was  to\n\nmanage  the  waste  systematically  and  activate  the  recycling  to  develop  the  concerned\n\nindustries and technologies.    The main amendment of the 'Waste Management Law' is the\n\nsystematic  management  of  the  wastes  depending  on  the  source,  composition,  and  toxicity,\n\nwhile promoting the development of the new waste recycling technologies.\n\nIn  order  for  a  smooth  enforcement  of  this  amended  law,  the  Ministry  of  Environment\n\nestablished  guidelines  for  a  more  detailed  waste  classification,  advanced  and  improved\n\nrecycle  management  structure,  and  recycling  environment  evaluation,  and  plans  to  do\n\nmaintenance on the enforcement ordinances and regulations.\n\n##### 1.3. Waste Management Plan\n\n###### 1.3.1.  Comprehensive National Waste Management Plan\n\nIn 1993, the Ministry of Environment established the ‘Comprehensive National Waste\n\nManagement  Plan  (1993~1995)’.    As  the  result  of  this  plan,  the  ‘Resource  Saving  and\n\nRecycling Law’ was enforced (1993), the ‘Waste Disposal Facility Installation and Local\n\nSupport  Law’  was  established  (1995),  and  the  ‘Standardized  Garbage  Bag  System’  was\n\nimplemented (1995).\n\nHowever, this plan was amended due to the numerous internal and external changes\n\nwhich had an effect on the waste management conditions and policies.    Two reasons for\n\n31\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\fthis  are  the  ‘Standardized  Garbage  Bag  System’  and  the  global  environmental  change.\n\nFirst of all, for one year after the initial implementation of the ‘Standardized Garbage Bag\n\nSystem’ in January 1995, residential waste was reduced by 27% and recycling increased\n\nby  35%,  bringing  about  the  need  for  a  waste  management  plan  to  respond  to  this.\n\nFurthermore,  there  was  also  the  need  for  change  in  the  central  government’s  policies\n\ntowards the local governments who were closing themselves off after the election of the\n\nlocal government heads.\n\nGlobally,  there  was  reorganization  in  the  world  order  of  gradual  integration  of\n\nenvironment and economy with the World Trade Organization (WTO) at the center, and\n\nKorea saw increasing need to change its environment.    Additionally, as the result of the\n\n1972  London  Treaty  on  the  prevention  of  ocean  pollution  from  disposal  of  wastes  and\n\nother matters, Korea had increasing need for new measures in preparation for the ocean\n\ndisposed waste ban in the near future.\n\nTherefore, the Ministry of Environment amended the ‘Comprehensive National Waste\n\nPlan’  which  was  established  under  the  policy  goal  of  ‘building  an  infrastructure  for  the\n\nresource recirculation economy’ as the basic plan on waste management, and established\n######## the ‘1st Comprehensive National Waste Management Plan (1996~2001)’.    Then the ‘2nd\n\nComprehensive National Waste Management Plan (2002~2011)’ was confirmed in March\n\n2003 to fixate the policy goal of a resource recirculation waste management system where\n\nthe  first  plan  was  developed  further  to  reduce  the  total  quantity  of  the  wastes,  recover\n\nresources  and  recycle  as  much  as  possible,  and  dispose  of  inevitable  wastes  in  an  eco-\n######## friendly,  safe  and  hygienic  way.    ‘The  3rd  Comprehensive  National  Waste  Management\n\nPlan’ is currently being finalized.\n\n######## The policy goal of the 1st Plan was ‘establishing a sustainable resource recirculation\n\neconomy infrastructure’ and three main focus areas were selected to achieve the goal of\n\npromoting  resource  recovery  to  protect  nature  and  providing  the  citizens  with  a  more\n\npleasant living environment.    The three focus areas are:\n\n#########   Waste  Minimization.    Efforts  would  be  made  to  develop  policies  in  stages  to\n\nminimize the production, distribution and consumption of the wastes during the entire\n\nlife cycle of a product.\n\n#########   Resource  Recovery.    An  integrated  recycling  system  would  be  constructed  to\n\n32\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\fpromote  resource  recovery  and  increase  the  efficiency  of  the  waste  resource\n\ndistribution.\n\n#########   Safe  Waste  Management.    A  plan  is  needed  to  find  ways  to  prevent  environmental\n\npollution and effectively manage harmful wastes.\n\n######## Additionally,  the  1st  plan  presented  five  main  strategies  for  clarifying  the  roles  and\n\nresponsibilities  of  each  economic  group,  integration  and  efficiency  of  the  waste\n\nmanagement  system,  minimization  of  wastes  at  each  stage  of  a  product’s  life  cycle,\n\npromotion  of  regional  competitiveness  based  on  the  characteristics  of  that  region,\n\nencouragement  for  more  public  participation  and  establishment  of  a  ‘Green  Spending’\n\nculture.\n\nWith  the  goal  of  achieving  a  sustainable  resource  recovery  society  or  a  Zero  Waste\n######## Society, the ‘2nd Comprehensive National Waste Management Plan (2002~2011, amended\n\nin 2007)’ presented six strategies.    “Zero Waste” or “Zero Discharge Waste” defined as a\n\nstate where zero waste is incinerated or buried but 100% of the waste is either re-used or\n\nrecycled.    It  is  an  ideal  or  theoretical  state  only  and  almost  impossible  to  achieve  in\n\nreality.  The  six  strategies  are  waste  risk  management,  waste  resource  recovery,  waste\n\nreduction,  waste  disposal  facility  installation  and  advanced  management,  waste\n\nmanagement  internationalization  and  cultivation  of  the  recycling  industry,  and  the\n\nconstruction of a customer-oriented waste management system.\n\n######## The ‘3rd Comprehensive National Waste Management Plan (2012~2021)’ is currently\n\nbeing finalized to include the construction of a competitive system by regions, technology\n\ndevelopment to promote waste recycling, and conduction of a national statistical study on\n\nwastes.\n\n###### 1.3.2.  Basic Resource Circulation Plan\n\n######## The  In  2011,  the  Ministry  of  Environment  established  the  ‘1st  Basic  Resource\n\nRecirculation  Plan  (2011~2015)’  to  build  an  upcycling  basis  for  waste  resources  in\n\naccordance with the ‘Resource Saving and Recycling Law’ with the objective of realizing\n\nthe  ‘Low  Carbon  Resource  Recirculation  Society’.    ‘Upcycling’  is  changing  the  wastes\n\ninto  a  new  material  or  product  that  is  higher  in  value  qualitatively  or  environmentally\n\n(Ministry  of  Environment,  2015).    Accordingly,  all  wastes  are  considered  upcycle-able\n\n33\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\fresources, that is to say, they can be recirculated 100%, and such acknowledgement is the\n\nbasic precondition for the realization of the low carbon recirculation society (Ministry of\n\nEnvironment, 2015).\n\nThis  plan  which  contains  five  strategies,  was  established  together  with  the  various\n\nKorean  ministries  such  as  the  Ministry  of  Public  Administration  and  Security,  Ministry\n\nfor Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Ministry of Knowledge Economy, and the\n\nMinistry of Land, and Transport and Maritime Affairs.    The five strategies are changing\n\nto  a  resource  recirculation  society  structure,  realizing  an  improved  value  resource\n\nrecirculation  (4Rs:  reduce,  reuse,  recycle,  recover  energy),  building  an  integrated  waste\n\ndisposal  infrastructure,  cultivating  the  resource  recirculation  industry  and  technology\n\ndevelopment,  and  providing  the  basis  for  implementation  such  as  a  national  resource\n\nrecirculation evaluation.\n\nMeanwhile, this plan serves as the guideline for promoting government-wide resource\n\nrecirculation  to  present  the  concerned  governmental  ministries  with  mid  and  long  term\n\ngoals and strategies for waste resource upcycling and green growth.\n\n##### 1.4. Waste Management System\n\n###### 1.4.1.  Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)\n\nThe main ‘Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)’ was enforced in January 2003 in\n\naccordance with the amended ‘Resource Saving and Recycling Law’.    The goal of EPR\n\nis to strengthen the responsibilities of the waste producers to reduce wastes and promote\n\nrecycling by inducing eco-friendly ways in all stages of waste management from product\n\ndesign, manufacturing, distribution, consumption, to disposal.\n\nIn  accordance  with  this  system,  the  producers  have  to  fulfill  their  responsibilities\n\ndepending on the number of product deliveries they receive and the obligatory quantity by\n\nproducts  annually  announced  by  the  government.    Those  producers  who  do  not  fulfill\n\ntheir  obligations  are  charged  the  ‘recycle  tax’  which  is  less  than  1.3  times  the  cost  to\n\ncollect and recycle a product.    The producers are also required to pay an allotted fee to\n\nthe Recycle Business Co-operative.\n\n34\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\fTable III-2 | Products Included in EPR\n\nClassification\n\nItems\n\n######### Products\n\nmobile phones)\n\n- Home appliances (TVs, refrigerators, washing machines,\n\n- Batteries (mercury, silver-oxide, nickel, cadmium)\n- Tires, lubricants, florescent lights\n\n######### Packaging\n\n- Paper packs, glass bottles, metal cans, and synthetic resin\nmaterial used for holding or packaging food and drinks,\nagricultural products, fishery products, meat products,\ndetergents, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and butane gases\n\nSource: KMOE, KERC. (2005). Extended Producer Responsibility. KMOE, KERC\n\nMeanwhile, the fulfilling of the obligatory recycling amount can be executed in either\n\nof three methods.    The first method is for the producer to recycle them himself, and the\n\nsecond  method  is  for  the  producer  to  hire  a  recycling  company  for  the  job.    The  third\n\nmethod  is  for  the  producer  to  join  the  Recycling  Business  Co-operative  and  pay  the\n\nallotted fee.    If a producer chooses to fulfill the recycling obligation using either the first\n\nor the second method, then there is an incentive given to the producer where a deduction\n\nis provided for the amount of payment of the allotted fee.    The amount of deduction is\n\nproportional to the recycling amount multiplied by a deduction factor determined by the\n\nMinisty of Environment.\n\n###### 1.4.2.  Standard Garbage Bag System\n\nThe ‘Standard Garbage Bag System’ was enforced in January 1995.    The targets for\n\nthis system are household garbage and wastes from small businesses that have the similar\n\ncomposition to the recyclable residential wastes.\n\nThis is a system where the waste producer pays a fee for the wastes they throw out,\n\nthus  reducing  waste  and  increasing  recycling.    The  fee  is  collected  through  the  sale  of\n\nspecial  garbage  bags  or  stickers  designated  by  each  local  government  for  the  wastes.\n\nAccordingly,  the  levying  of  the  garbage  fee  changed  from  a  fixed  amount  based  on\n\nproperty tax or building area, to be proportional to the waste output (through usage of the\n\n‘standard garbage bags’).\n\n35\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\fAccording  to  this  system,  waste  has  to  be  disposed  of  at  a  specific  area  using  the\n\nstandardized  garbage  bags  but  if  these  special  bags  are  not  used  and  the  offender  is\n\nidentified,  a  fine  of  less  than  1  million  won  (U$850)  is  charged.    However,  the\n\nstandardized  garbage  bags  are  not  required  and  collected  free  of  charge  for  recyclable\n\nwastes if they are disposed of in accordance with the guidelines of the local governments.\n\nFor  those  large  wastes  that  cannot  be  disposed  of  in  the  standardized  garbage  bags,\n\nhouseholds need to be call the local district office and ask for removal of the waste with\n\nsome payment.    The payment amount and an invoice is issued by the local district office\n\nand  the  households  need to  go  to any  bank  to  make  the  payment  (invoice  is  needed  for\n\npayment).\n\n###### 1.4.3.  Sharing Expenses System\n\nThe ‘Sharing Expense System’ was introduced in 1993 to suppress the production of\n\nwastes from the product manufacturing stages as well as to prevent waste.    This system\n\ncharges  a  waste  disposal  fee  to  the  manufacturer  or  importer  of  products,  supplies  or\n\ncontainers that contain harmful materials or are difficult to recycle, causing problems in\n\nwaste  management.    These  products  include  containers  for  insecticides  and  hazardous\n\nproducts, antifreeze, gum, disposable diapers, cigarettes, and plastics.\n\nThe  “sharing  expense  fee”  is  included  in  the  special  accounts  for  environmental\n\nimprovement and used for the promotion and activation of recycling.    The purpose of the\n\nfee is to purchase and store recyclable resources, support recycling businesses and install\n\nwaste  disposal  facilities,  research  and  develop  technologies  to  effectively  recycle  and\n\nreduce wastes, and support the local governments in the collection and recycling costs of\n\nthe wastes.\n\n##### 1.5. Summary and Implications\n\nIn  reviewing  the  development  trends  of  Korea’s  waste  management  policies  based  on\n\nthe contents discussed, it is apparent that as time went on, development took place in Korea\n\nin  the  order  of  ‘garbage  cleaning  -  waste  reduction  -  safe  handling  of  wastes  and  waste\n\nmanagement  reinforcement  -  recycling  and  resource  recirculation’.    In  other  words,  from\n\ncleaning or reducing wastes, the policies gradually progressed and developed into efficiently\n\n36\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\fand  effectively  managing  and  using  recyclable  wastes,  to  improving  the  usage  value  or\n\nadding new value to the wastes as if the wastes were also resources as well.\n\nIn the past before the industrialization era, when Korea’s main concern was ‘how not to\n\ngo  hungry’  and  livelihood  was  the  most  important  thing  for  the  people,  residential  wastes\n\nwere almost neglected.    However, with the continuous increase in population and livelihood\n\nactivities  became  more  vigorous,  the  wastes  produced  also  grew  drastically  and  the\n\npreviously neglected wastes not only damaged the views of the residential environments but\n\nalso public spaces such as roads as well, while the serious odors became an important social\n\nissue.    Hence, the ‘Garbage Cleaning Law’ was established in 1961 to dispose the wastes to\n\nprovide a pleasant living environment, becoming the starting point for waste disposal.\n\nHowever,  with  the  increase  of  industrial  wastes  resulting  from  industrialization  which\n\nwas  taking  place  in  the  late  1970s,  industrial  wastes  became  a  separate  category  under  the\n\n‘Environmental Protection Law’ of 1977.    In addition, with the increasing wastes resulting\n\nfrom industrialization leading to environmental pollution problems, and the rise in awareness\n\nof  the  importance  in  environmental  protection,  political  weight  began  to  move  from  just\n\ncleaning  up  the  garbage  to  slowly  reducing  the  amount  of  waste  to  fundamentally  and\n\nactively solving the waste issues and seeking ways to protect the environment.\n\nThrough the establishment of the ‘Waste Management Law’ in the late 1980s, the waste\n\nmanagement  policy  entered  a  full-scale  progressive  stage.    With  the  importance  of  safe\n\ntreatment and reinforcement of waste management becoming more apparent as the result of\n\nthe  continuously  increasing  wastes,  policies  for  residential  wastes  and  industrial  wastes\n\nintegrated as one comprehensive structure.    Furthermore, a new concept of ‘recycling’ was\n\nintroduced  in  the  ‘Waste  Management  Law’  by  changing  the  thinking  of  wastes  as  simply\n\nbeing ‘useless garbage that need to be removed’ to ‘materials that can be used again’.    This\n\nthought  process  became  the  starting  point  for  drawing  up  a  policy  to  systematically  and\n\nefficiently  manage  all  the  stages  of  waste  management  from  waste  production,  collection,\n\ntransportation, incineration, landfill and recycling.\n\n37\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\fFigure III-1 | Development Trends of Korea’s Waste Management Policies\n\nMeanwhile, the waste management policy from the 1990s until the present has focused\n\non  increasing  not  only  recycling  based  on  the  ‘Resource  Saving  and  Recycling  Law’,  the\n\n‘Electric  Appliances,  Electronic  Products,  and  Automobile  Resources  Recirculation  Law’,\n\nand the ‘Standardized Garbage Bag System’, but also on building a ‘Low Carbon Resource\n\nRecirculation  Society’  through  ‘Waste  Upcycling’.    It  can  be  said  that  the  increasing\n\nawareness on the importance of environmental protection within Korea had a large impact on\n\nsuch trend, but the global trend of focusing on national competitiveness and world order as\n\nwell as ‘environment’ and ‘economy’ centering around the World Trade Organization (WTO)\n\nalso had a considerable affect.\n\n‘Waste  Upcycling’  is  one  step  further  in  development  beyond  ‘waste  recycling’.    In\n\nother words, it is adding a new design or process to a waste to add value qualitatively and\n\nenvironmentally and recreating a new material or product.    When waste upcycling actively\n\ntakes place, not only will waste reduction and recycling be achieved, but also will secure the\n\nnecessary resources to manufacture a new product effectively from the point of view of costs\n\n38\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\fand  productivity.    Furthermore,  new  industries  can  be  created  and  developed  centering  on\n\nwaste upcycling.\n\nIn order for these effects to be actually displayed, there is a need for a policy to back up\n######## the waste upcycling.    Accordingly, it will be interesting to see the outcomes of the ‘1st Basic\n\nResource Recirculation Plan (2011~2015)’ established by the Korean government in 2011 by\n\nemphasizing  the  importance  of  waste  resource  upcycling  and  the  follow  up  policies\n\ndeveloped afterwards.    Also, during the follow up policy establishment processes, it will be\n\nimportant  to  seriously  consider  the  efficient  management  of  the  wastes  as  well  as  the\n\nupcycling  technologies  and  policies  supporting  product  development,  bearing  in  mind  the\n\nupcycling process itself.\n\n##### 1.6. Comparison  of\n\nthe  Waste  Management  Policy\n\nfor\n\nBarbados and Korea\n\nThe waste management policy of Korea started with the ‘Garbage Cleaning Law’ in 1961\n\nto clean up the garbage of the cities, and influenced by industrialization, the ‘Environmental\n\nProtection Law’ was enforced in 1978 to manage the industrial wastes, looking for ways to\n\nactively  improve  the  environmental  pollution.    Additionally,  with  the  enforcement  of  the\n\n‘Waste Management Law’ in 1986 to efficiently manage the increasing wastes, the ‘Garbage\n\nCleaning Law’ and the ‘Environmental Protection Law’ were integrated into one.\n\n‘The  Health  Services  Act  (law  to  promote  and  preserve  health)’  of  Barbados  started  to\n\nmanage the wastes in 1969, and with the gradual increase in population and development of\n\nthe  tourism  industry,  the  ‘Integrated  Solid  Waste  Management  Programme  (ISWMP)’  was\n\nenforced in 1993 to improve Barbados’s weak area of solid wastes.\n\nBoth  Korea  and  Barbados  integrated  the  relevant  waste  policies  in  1986  and  1993\n\nrespectively in order to efficiently manage the wastes, but Korea opens the ‘Law Separation\n\nEra’ in 1993 by establishing separate laws for each waste product.    That is to say, the focus\n\nof  Korea’s  waste  management  policy  is  in  suppressing  the  production  of  wastes  and\n\npromoting resource recirculation through recycling, and thus various waste systems that were\n\npreviously  regulated  by  the  traditional  Waste  Management  Law  were  separated  into  the\n\nResource Recycling Law and the Individual Recycling Law (Chae, 2009).\n\n39\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\fKorea currently not only has policies to increase waste recycling, but also established the\n\n‘1st  Basic  Resource  Recirculation  Plan  (2011~2015)’  to  realize the  ‘Low  Carbon  Resource\n\nRecirculation  Society’.    In  order  to  achieve  the  low  carbon  resource  recirculation  society,\n\nthe policy makers in Korea are aware that all wastes are resources that can be upcycled 100%.\n\nBarbados also has established the ‘Barbados Sustainable Development Policy (BSDP)’ and\n\n‘The  National  Strategic  Plan  of  Barbados  2005~2015)'  to  establish  the  basic  principles  for\n\nsustainable development.\n\nBoth  Korea  and  Barbados  have  developed  policies  and  legal  structures  for  solid  waste\n\nmanagement differently in accordance with the social, cultural, economic, and geographical\n\nenvironments of each country.    If Korea strengthens the legal system of the necessary areas\n\nthrough  segmentation  of  Korea’s  relatively  multi-complex  industrial  structure,  various\n\ninternational  stakeholders  and  rapid  growth,  Barbados  has  a  relatively  simple  industrial\n\nstructure to manage the solid wastes integrally.    However, both countries are striving for a\n\nresource recycling and resource recirculation society for sustainable development.\n\n### 2.  General Status of Waste in Korea\n\n##### 2.1. Definition and Classification of Waste\n\nIn Under Article 2 of the “Waste Management Law”, waste is defined as ‘materials that\n\nare no longer needed in people’s lives or business  activities’.    Also, residential wastes are\n\nwastes  other  than  the  business  wastes,  while  business  wastes  are  wastes  produced  by  air,\n\nwater  quality,  noise  and  vibration  discharging  facilities  and  businesses  designated  by  the\n\npresidential decree.    Designated wastes are those such as waste oil and waste acid that can\n\npollute  the  surrounding  environments  or  those  that  can  be  harmful  to  the  body  such  as\n\nmedical wastes and determined by the presidential decree.\n\n40\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\fFigure III-2 | Classification Structure\n\nThe  classification  of  the  wastes  can  be  categorized  largely  into  residential  wastes  and\n\nworkplace wastes, where residential wastes are those other than the workplace wastes, and\n\nworkplace wastes can be classified into three types – general workplace wastes, construction\n\nwastes, and designated wastes.    Here, general workplace wastes are classified as workplace\n\nwastes  and  discharging  facilities  wastes,  and  designated  wastes  are  classified  as  medical\n\nwastes  and  designated  wastes  other  than  the  medical  wastes.    In  other  words,  workplace\n\nwastes  are  those  that  are  discharged  more  than  300kg  per  day  or  more  than  5  tons  as  the\n\nresult  of  a  series  of  constructions  or  work  (excluding  construction  companies),  and\n\ndischarging  facilities  wastes  are  wastes  produced  by  air,  water  quality,  noise  and  vibration\n\ndischarging facilities, end waste water treatment facilities, public sewage treatment facilities,\n\nhuman excretion treatment facilities, public animal excrement treatment facilities, and waste\n\ndisposal facilities.    Construction wastes are wastes from construction companies producing\n\nmore than 5 tons from construction work.\n\n##### 2.2. Waste Generation and Disposal\n\n####### 2.2.1.  Waste Generation\n\nUnder the “Waste Controls Act” the Korean government conducts research every\n\nyear  to  determine  the  source  of  the  produced  wastes,  types  and  principal  treatment\n\nagents,  treatment  methods,  and  treatment  status,  and  a  national  statistical  waste\n\n41\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\fresearch every five years to use as the basic data for policy establishment.\n\nWaste quantities from 1999 until 2012 continued to increase starting in 1999 from\n\n219,217 tons/day, and increasing close to twice the amount in 2012 at 394,510 tons/day.\n\nLooking  at  the  compositions,  there  was  no  big  change  in  the  residential  wastes  and\n\ndesignated wastes, but the composition of the general workplace wastes increased by\n\nabout  1.4  times,  while  construction  wastes  increased  by  approximately  3  times.\n\nWhen looking at the waste status ratio in 2013, construction waste was approximately\n\n47%, general workplace wastes was 37%, residential wastes was 12%, and designated\n\nwaste was about 3%.\n\n#### Figure III-3 | Waste Generation for the last 15 years\n\nSource: KMOE.

Waste Disposal\n\nLooking at the residential wastes by disposal methods for 1999, out of the total of\n\n45,614  tons/day,  landfill  was  largest  with  52%,  incineration  was  38%,  recycling  was\n\nlowest  with  10%,  but  in  2012,  out  of  the  total  residential  waste  of  48,990  tons/day,\n\nlandfill was rapidly reduced to 16%, and recycling rapidly increased with 59%.    From\n\n2005, with the ban of burying  food wastes and waste separation expanded, recycling\n\nincreased while influencing the reduction of incineration and landfill.\n\nAs the result of the standardized garbage bag system, recycling policy, and waste\n\nresource energy conversion implemented from 2000, Korea’s waste disposal structure\n\nis changing  from a simple landfill-oriented system to a resource recirculation system\n\nthat prioritizes the recirculation of waste resources.\n\n43\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\fFigure III-5 | Disposal of Residential Waste\n\nSource: KMOE.

Waste Disposal Companies\n\nIf a waste is disposed or recycled in Korea, permission is required under the ‘Waste\n\nControls  Act’.    The  waste  disposal  business  can  be  categorized  into  collection  and\n\ntransport, middle  disposal,  final  disposal,  and  recycling.    For  the  construction  waste\n\ndisposal companies, they need permission for the middle disposal process.    There are\n\na  total  of  12,534  approved  waste  disposal  companies  comprising  of  6,573  collection\n\nand transport companies, 262 middle disposal companies, 55 final disposal companies,\n\n5,146 recycling companies, and 498 middle processing (construction waste) companies.\n\n“Middle  disposal”  and  “middle  processing”  companies  are  categories  only  used  in\n\nKorea  which  refers  to  companies  performing  incomplete  processing  such  as  simple\n\nshredding, sorting, chemical treatment, etc.\n\n44\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\fTable III-3 | Waste Disposal Companies\n\nCategory\n\nHousehold\n\nCollection\n& Transport\n\nMiddle\nDisposal\n\nFinal\nDisposal\n\nRecycling\n\nMiddle\nProcessing\n\n1,473\n\nEmission Facility\n\n2,983\n\n184\n\n38\n\n4,577\n\nTotal\n\n1,473\n\n7,782\n\nConstruction &\nDemolition\n\n1,495\n\nSpecial Waste\n\n464\n\nMedical Waste\n\n158\n\n63\n\n15\n\n17\n\n569\n\n498\n\n1,993\n\n1,113\n\n173\n\nTotal\n\n6,573\n\n262\n\n55\n\n5,146\n\n498\n\n12,534\n\nSource: KMOE.

Case Studies in Korea\n\n##### 3.1. Automatic Pipeline Transport System\n\nIn the general case, residential waste are placed in standard garbage bags and discharged\n\nin pre-specified locations near the house for curb side service.    The main problems for this\n\ngeneral process is odor, unpleasant view, flies and other insects, cats which are major causes\n\nof  claims  by  residents  in  the  area.    A  new  process  and  system  is  currently  being\n\nimplemented  in  a  few  areas  in  Seoul  such  as  the  Eunpyung  region  where  an  Automatic\n\nPipeline  Transport  System  (APTS)  is  constructed  and  being  used  to  solve  the  above\n\nmentioned problems.    Test cases were started in 1990 and now in 2015, newly constructed\n\napartment complexes all are equipped with the APTS.\n\nThe  Figure  below  show  the  conceptual  idea  behind  the  APTS  where  residents  in  the\n\napartment complexes would bring their residential waste to fixed location trash bin and using\n\ntheir pre-assigned RFID cards, residents would open the trash bins with their RFID cards and\n\ndeposit their waste in the bins.    The bins are directly connected to nearby incineration plants\n\nvia an underground (or above ground) pipelines which uses vacuum suction to automatically\n\ntransport the deposited waste to the incineration plant where the waste are burned for energy.\n\nThe APTS eliminates the need for collection trucks and residents can discharge waste at any\n\ntime of the week without delay.\n\n#### Figure III-6 | Automatic Pipeline Transport System\n\nSource: KWEA.

Allbaro System\n\nUp  to  the  year  2000,  all  data  related  to  waste  collection  and  disposal  were  manually\n\nrecorded  and  stored.    The  collection  companies  recorded  collection  activities  using  daily\n\nwork sheets and disposal companies recorded all disposal activities using a daily log.    The\n\nmanual process was inefficient in using unnecessary time, manpower and effort to perform\n\ntasks that could were menial and labor extensive.\n\nIn 2001, a computer system called “Allbaro” was implemented in order to automate the\n\ndata collection, storage, and retrieval process associated with waste collection and disposal\n\ndata.    All  collection  companies,  transportation  companies,  transfer  stations,  disposal\n\ncompanies  would  input  daily  collection,  transportation  and  disposal  data  into  the  Allbaro\n\nsystem online where all waste related data was managed centrally which could be accessed\n\nand shared by all stakeholders.    Allbaro is the only automatic waste management system in\n\nthe  world  that  is  used  by  all  stakeholders  throughout  the  whole  nation.    Currently,  over\n\n350,000  companies  and  organizations  are  using  the  system  and every  year  over  10  million\n\ndata  activities  are  processed  by  the  system.    The  system  keeps  track  of  over  128  million\n\ntons of waste each year.\n\n49\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\fFigure III-8 | Waste Information Management System (Allbaro)\n\nSource: Allbaro System. https://www.allbaro.or.kr. Oct. 2015\n\n##### 3.3. Medical Waste RFID System\n\nIn  20015,  in  order  to  properly  monitor  and  manage  medical  waste  which  might  be\n\nhazardous  or  contagious,  the  Ministry  of  Environment  issued  standardized  plastic  bins\n\nspecifically for the storage and transport of medical waste.    These plastic bins were tagged\n\nusing RFID tags in order to track the progress of the waste from the initial discharge to the\n\nfinal disposal.\n\n#### Figure III-9 | Plastic bins for medical waste with RFID tags\n\n50\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\f3.4. Use of GPS-based System for Budgeting Purposes\n\nIn Korea, almost all the collection and transport activities are outsourced to private waste\n\nhaulers and in order to accurately determine the necessary budget to contract with the private\n\ncompanies,  the  local  governments  estimates  the  following  parameters  needed  for  the\n\ncollection  and  transport  activities:  1)  cost  of  manpower,  2)  cost  of  truck  operations,  3)\n\noperational expenses, and 4) management costs.    All the other parameters can be estimated\n\nusing past data; however, in order to estimate the cost of truck operations, we need to know\n\nthe  exact  routes  taken  by  the  trucks  in  performing  the  collection  and  transport.    A  GPS-\n\nbased  tracking  system  can  be  used  to  monitor  and  track  the  actual  routes  of  the  collection\n\ntrucks operated by the private waste haulers.    The Figure below shows one example of such\n\na system used by a local government agency in Korea.\n\n#### Figure III-10 | Example of the GPS-based Tracking System\n\n##### 3.5. Residential Waste and Disposal\n\n###### 3.5.1.  Separation and Disposal of Residential Waste\n\nResidential  waste  is  separated  at  the  point  of  discharge  depending  on  the\n\ncomposition  of  the  waste.    Combustible  wastes  and  incombustible  wastes  are\n\nseparated and discharged in their respective standardized garbage bags.    There are no\n\nspecial criteria for recyclable wastes, but they are discharged in transparent bags that\n\n51\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\fmake  it  easy  to  confirm  the  contents  inside  the  transparent  bags.    Large  garbage  is\n\nclassified as used furniture and used household appliances, where stickers have to be\n\npurchased at the local district offices and put on the discharged furniture before they\n\ncan  be  collected,  while  the  discharged  household  appliances  are  collected  free  of\n\ncharge if they are properly reported to the local district office.\n\n###### 3.5.2.  Types  of  Trucks  for  the  Collection  and  Transportation  of\n\n####### Residential Wastes\n\nThe trucks for collecting and transporting of residential wastes differ depending on\n\nthe  type  of  garbage.    Combustible  wastes  are  generally  transported  by  compressor\n\ntrucks, and if the distance between the collection site and disposal depot is far, they are\n\nsometimes  transferred  to  an  “arm-roll”  truck  at  a  transfer  station  and  before  being\n\ntransported to the disposal depot.\n\n#### Figure III-11 | Types fo Trucks\n\nFood  wastes  are  transported  with  tank-lorries  made  exclusively  for  this  purpose\n\nand  these  trucks  are  equipped  with  mechanical  devices  on  the  front  or  side  of  the\n\ntrucks  to  load  the  special  food  waste  containers.    Recyclable  wastes  are  mostly\n\ntransported in cargo trucks that can unload in ‘dumping’ style.    These trucks usually\n\nhave high sides and an open-top.    However, the recent trend for the recyclable waste\n\ntrucks  is  renovating  them  by  closing  off  the  top  for  safety  and  for  environmental\n\nreasons.    Bulky  wastes,  such  as  used  household  appliances,  are  transported  with\n\n52\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\f“Wing-Body” trucks that open sideways or topside, while cargo trucks with open tops\n\nare used for furniture.\n\n###### 3.5.3.  Residential Waste Disposal Methods\n\nIn general, residential wastes are disposed of by incineration, landfill, re-utilization\n\nor recycling.    There are currently approximately 500 incineration facilities in Korea,\n\nwhere most of the medium and large incineration facilities recycle the heat to produce\n\nhot  water  or  electricity  (waste-to-energy  plants).    The  incineration  facilities  are\n\nmanaged in accordance with the installation, management, and inspection standards of\n\nthe Waste Management Law, and the emitted gas is managed strictly by the air quality\n\nstandards of the Law.    The Stoker-type incinerators are mostly used in Korea because\n\nof their efficiency and proven technology.    However, various other types such as the\n\nFluidized  Bed,  Rotary  Kiln,  Gasification,  and  Plasma  were  all  considered  with  few\n\ncurrently in operation.\n\nThere  are  about  290  landfills  in  Korea,  where  220  are  public  facilities.    The\n\nlandfill  facilities  are  operated  in  accordance  with  the  installation,  maintenance  and\n\nfollow-up  standards  for  dikes,  shield  skirts,  leachate  treatment  sites,  underground\n\nwater  control,  gas  pileup  facilities,  etc.  accordance  to  the  Waste  Management  Law.\n\nThe largest landfill is the Metropolitan Landfill which is in the vicinity of  Seoul and\n\nhandles the wastes generated in Seoul, Incheon and the Gyeonggi Province.\n\nFood wastes are mostly handled by the three facilities comprised of the Compost\n\nFacility,  the  Fodder  Facility,  and  the  Anaerobic  Digestion  Facility.    With  the\n\nestablishment  of  the  Landfill  Prohibition  Law  in  2005,  the  food  waste  treatment\n\nfacilities  increased  to  280  nationwide,  and  they  are  being  managed  by  the  Waste\n\nManagement Law together with the incineration facilities and the landfills.\n\nRecyclable wastes consist of glass bottles, metal cans, plastics, papers, vinyls, and\n\nstyrofoams  that  can  be  reused  or  recycled.    They  are  transported  to  the  recyclables\n\nsorting  facility  in  their  mixed  state  at  the  time  of  the  collections,  and  then  separated\n\ninto various materials by people or machines.    There are some 200 public and private\n\nsorting facilities in Korea, and the separated materials are then auctioned and sold to\n\nvarious recycling companies.\n\n53\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\fThe SRF (Solid Refuse Fuel) Facility is an energy recovering facility that emerged\n\nas  the  substitute  for  the  incineration  facilities.    SRF  is  also  called  the  RDF  (Refuse\n\nDerived Fuel) in the past.    The SRF Facility produces solid refuse fuel in ‘pellet’ or\n\n‘fluff’  form  by  crushing,  grinding,  drying  and  shaping  the  combustible  wastes,  and\n\nthese  wastes  are  used  as  natural  fuels  in  cogeneration  plants,  cement  kilns,  and\n\nindustrial boilers after the contaminants are removed and heat is increased.\n\n###### 3.5.4.  Residential Waste Management in the City of Seoul\n\n######### 1)  Residential Wastes and Disposal\n\nSeoul,  the  Capital  City  of  the  Republic  of  Korea,  has  an  area  of  605km2,  and  a\n\npopulation  of  approximately  10.40  million  people.    It  is  a  large  city  with  25\n\nadministrative  districts  and  generates  an average  of  about  8,559  tons  (as  of  2012)  of\n\nresidential  wastes  daily,  with  each  person  generating  0.8kg  a  day.    With  the\n\nStandardized  Garbage  Bag  System  implemented  in  1994,  the  residential  wastes\n\ndecreased by 40% compared to 2012, and landfill was reduced to 94%.\n\n#### Figure III-12 | Trend in Waste Generation and Burial in Seoul\n\nSource: Yu. (2015). Policy on Waste Management in Seoul. City of Seoul\n\nBased on the 2012 residential wastes, general garbage was 3,078 tons (36%), food\n\nwaste was 3,072 tons (35.9%), and recyclable waste was 2,409 tons (28.1%).    From\n\nthis amount, 2,304 tons (42%) were incinerated, 774 tons (14.1%) were landfilled, and\n\n54\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\f5,481 tons (43.9%) were recycled, making recycling the most used method for waste\n\ntreatment.\n\n######### 2)  Residential Waste Collection and Disposal System\n\nResidential waste is separated into general waste and recyclable waste, and general\n\nwaste  is  collected  by  the  local  governments  and  transported  to  the  incineration\n\nfacilities  and  landfills.    There  are  five  incineration  facilities  in  Seoul,  and  only  one\n\nlandfill, the Metropolitan Landfill.    Recyclable wastes are collected by both the local\n\ngovernments  and  private  recycling  waste  collection  companies.\n\n  The\n\nlocal\n\ngovernments  transport  to  the  recyclables  sorting  center  where  they  are  auctioned  off\n\nafter  the  EPR  registration,  while  private  collectors  work  directly  with  the  recycling\n\ncompanies.    Food  wastes  are  collected  by  the  local  governments  and  directly\n\ncontracted with recycling companies in Seoul and its vicinity.\n\n######### 3)  Residential Waste Collection and Management Infrastructure\n\nThe  collection  and  transportation  of  residential  wastes  and  the  management  of\n\nstreet sweeping for the city of Seoul are differentiated.    In the case of collecting and\n\ntransporting,  most  of  the  local  district  offices  work  independently  by  contracting  the\n\njobs to third parties while operating with the income from the selling of standardized\n\ngarbage  bags.    There  are  3,018  sanitation  workers  cleaning  from  19:00  until  05:00\n\ndaily.\n\n#### Table III-8 |Residential Waste Collection and Management Infrastructure in Seoul\n\nCategory\n\nCollection &\nTransportation\n\nStreet Sweeping\n\nResponsible Party\n\nContractor\n\nLocal District Office\n\nNumber of\nSanitation Workers\n\n3,018 people\n\n2,559 people\n\nCleaning Time\n\n19:00 ~ 05:00\n\n05:00 ~ 15:00\n\nOperation\n\nIndependent\n\nLocal District Office\n\nSource: City of Seoul.

The  Metropolitan  Landfill  and  Plans  for  the  Futuristic\n\n####### Theme Park\n\n######### 1)  Metropolitan Landfill Facility\n\nThe Metropolitan Landfill was formed in 1992 and located in Seo-gu, Incheon to\n\ntreat  the  residential  and  construction  wastes  generated  in  Seoul,  Incheon  and  part  of\n######## the  Gyeonggi  Province.    It  has  an  area  of  15,410,000  m2 with  the  capacity  of 228\n\nmillion tons.    It is comprised of four zones, with Zone 1 currently being used as a golf\n\ncourse after the area was filled completely.    Zone 2 is currently in use, with Zones 3\n\nand 4 remaining in reserve.\n\n#### Figure III-14 | Current Status of Metroplitan Landfill\n\nSource: SLC. (2015). Development of Eco-Friendly Energy Town. SLC\n\n######### 2)  Eco-Friendly Metropolitan Landfill Energy Town\n\nThe  Metropolitan  Landfill  is  managed  by  the  Metropolitan  Landfill  Site\n\nManagement Corporation that was established by the Korean government to handle the\n\nwastes from the initial two cities and one province.    In the beginning, the Corporation\n\nwas planned to manage the landfill site only, but with the change in the waste policies\n\nand the times, it is now managing a variety of energy facilities additionally.\n\n59\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\fIn accordance with the government’s changed policy to reduce wastes and recycle\n\nmore, the inflow of wastes to the Metropolitan Landfill was drastically reduced after\n\n1994 from 11.7 million tons to 3.45 million tons in 2013, almost below 1/3.    Taking\n\ninto consideration the recent increase in oil prices and the basic conditions for utilizing\n\nenergy, the formation of an eco-friendly energy town was planned from the end of the\n\n1990s.    The eco-friendly energy town was formed because there were infrastructures\n\nfor  the  new  towns  and  industrial  complexes  to  supply  heat  and  electricity  near  the\n\nvicinity of the Metropolitan Landfill, and there were a lot of combustible and organic\n\nwastes coming into the landfill that could be utilized for energy.\n\nThe  Metropolitan  Landfill  Eco-friendly  Energy  Town  uses  the  LFG  from  the\n\nlandfill to produce 50MWh of electricity, the largest amount of its kind in the world,\n\nand operates a 200 ton/day SRF facility, with 25,000Nm3 of bio gas (methane content\n\nof more than 60%) from anaerobic digestion of the food waste water.    In addition, the\n\nTown  is  equipped  with  a  sewer  sludge  dry  fuel  facility  (1,000  tons/day),  a  bio  gas\n\nautomobile  fuel  facility  (10  m3/minute),  a  bio  circulation  forest,  a  resource\n\nrecirculation  research  center  and  training  facility,  an  international  exhibition hall and\n\nconvention facility.\n\n######### 3)  Plans of the Me`tropolitan Landfill Futuristic Theme Park\n\nThe Metropolitan Landfill plans to go beyond its status of being the largest landfill\n\nand  eco-friendly  energy  town,  to  form  a  global  theme  park  and  resort  of  the  future.\n\nThe  goal  of  this  project  is  to  contribute  to  the  activation  of  Incheon’s  economy  and\n\nnational  development  by  forming  a  multi-resort  complex  with  a  variety  of  contents\n\nincluding  environmental,  touristic,  leisure,  recreational,  cultural,  amusement,  and\n\ncommercial.\n\n[INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK]\n\n60\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\fFigure III-15 | Plan for Future Them Park\n\nSource: SLC.

Recommendation\n\n### 1.  Recommendation for Number of Operational Trucks\n\n##### 1.1. Evaluation Method for Collection Efficiency\n\n###### 1.1.1.  MHT (Man Hour per Ton)\n\nMHT is the man hour needed to collect one ton of waste, that is to say, the amount\n\nof  time  needed  for  one  man  to  collect  one  ton  of  garbage.    This  number  changes\n\ndepending on the location of the garbage bin, distance, type and shape of the garbage\n\nbin, and the ability and type of the collection truck.    In other words, the MHT is the\n\ndirect variable that represents the collection efficiency.\n\nAccording  to  Dr.  Tchobanoglos  in  “Waste  Treatment  and  Disposal”,  the  garbage\n\nbag  collection  method  involving  the  disposable  garbage  containers  was  the  most\n\nefficient with 0.9 MHT, the usual street collection was 1.6 MHT, and the ‘set out’, ‘set\n\nout & set back’, and ‘back yard carry’ where the sanitation workers had to go indoors\n\nseveral  times  to  bring  out  the  wastes  were  the  most  labor-intensive  with  2.6  MHT.\n\nNormally, based on the level o MHT equal to 1.0, collection efficiency is considered\n\ngood if it is below this number, and poor if it is above.    However, this MHT value is\n\nthe  official  time-expense  estimation  of  the  sanitation  workers,  so  the  number  can  be\n\nreduced if the waste generation is coordinated amongst households.\n\n#### Table IV-1 | General MHT Dependent on Type of Container and Location of Collection\n\nCategory\n\nPlastic Bags\n\nMovable\n\nFixed\n\nOutdoors\n\nIndoors\n\nOutdoors\n\nIndoors  Outdoors\n\nIndoors\n\nFixed\n\nActual Collection\n\nOther *\n\nTotal\n\n0.12\n\n1.23\n\n1.35\n\n0.24\n\n1.23\n\n1.47\n\n0.63\n\n1.23\n\n1.86\n\n0.73\n\n1.23\n\n1.96\n\n1.01\n\n1.23\n\n2.24\n\n1.16\n\n1.23\n\n2.38\n\n※  In  “Other”,  the  time  in-between  collections,  time  to  and  from  transfer  stations,  and  time  for\n\nunloading at the transfer station are all included.\n\nSource: Min, et al.

The Time-Motion Study\n\nThe Time-Motion Study is a research done on the time it takes for the collection\n\ntrucks or carts to leave the depot until they return with a full load.    In this case also,\n\nthe value changes depending on the location of the garbage bin, the distance, the type\n\nand shape of the garbage bin, the ability and type of the collection truck, the type of\n\nresidence  and  the  distance  between  the  collections.    Like  the  MHT  value,  the\n\n63\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\fcollection time is determined depending on the type and location of the garbage bin,\n\nand  the  actual  collection  time  is  used  to  influence  the  overall  collection  time.\n\nTherefore,  it  can  be  understood  that  in  order  to  reduce  the  collection  time,  it  is\n\nadvisable to install movable rather than fixed garbage bins, outdoors instead of indoors,\n\nand the best collection method is the ‘Bag’ method like the standardized garbage bags.\n\nThe  Time-Motion  Study  can  be  explained  as  follows,  and  this  data  is  used  to\n\ndetermine the collection efficiency factor:\n\n-  services/day/truck ː number of houses per day per truck\n\n-  services/man/hr ː number of houses per man per hour\n\n-  tons/day/truck ː collection volume per day per truck\n\n-  tons/man/hr ː collection volume per man per hour\n\n#### Table IV-3 | Time-Motion Study Dependent on Type of Container\n\nCategory\n\nPlastic\nBags\n\nMovable\n\nFixed\n\nOutdoors\n\nIndoors  Outdoors\n\nIndoors\n\nWall\nAttachment\n\nActual Collection Time\n\n3.7\n\nTravel Time During\nCollection\n\nTravel Time To\nTransshipment Depot\n\nUnloading Time at\nTransshipment Depot\n\nOther\n\n(Total)\n\n4.8\n\n15.2\n\n12.8\n\n5.4\n\n7.4\n\n4.8\n\n15.2\n\n12.8\n\n5.4\n\n19.6\n\n22.7\n\n31.4\n\n35.9\n\n4.8\n\n15.2\n\n12.8\n\n5.4\n\n4.8\n\n4.8\n\n15.2\n\n15.2\n\n12.8\n\n12.8\n\n5.4\n\n5.4\n\n4.8\n\n15.2\n\n12.8\n\n5.4\n\n41.9\n\n45.6\n\n57.8\n\n60.9\n\n69.6\n\n74.1\n\n##### 1.2. Time-Motion Study in Barbados\n\n###### 1.2.1.  Route Selection for the Time-Motion Study\n\nIn  terms  of  waste  disposal  collection,  Barbados  is  divided  into  five  regions  of\n\nNorth, South East, South West, City East, and City West.    Taking into consideration\n\nthe  distance between the regions,  two  depots,  the Wildey  Depot  in  the  south  and the\n\nNorth Depot in the north are in operation for the garbage trucks.    While the Wildey\n\n64\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\fDepot is responsible for collecting wastes  from four out of the  five regions  of  South\n\nEast, South West, City East and City West, the North Depot is only responsible for the\n\nNorth region.\n\nFor the Time-Motion Study, two routes of South East and City West were selected\n\nfrom the Wildey Depot.    Route 1 used the ML 271 collection truck with the capacity\n\nof 14.25 tons.    The ML 271 left the garage at Wildey Depot, collected the wastes at\n\nSouth  East’s  Mangrove  Ocean  City  Foul  Bay,  unloaded  at  the  SBRC  Landfill  and\n\nreturned to the Depot.    Route 2 used the ML 278 collection truck with the capacity of\n\n######### 5.92 tons.    The truck left Wildey Depot for the Bridge Town Farm Road at City West\n\nto collect the wastes, unloaded at the SBRC Landfill and also returned to the Depot.\n\n#### Figure IV-1 | Time-Motion Study Routes\n\n                    ▷ Route 1 [ML 271 truck]\n\n                          Wildey  Depot  (garage)  ⇒  South  East  Region  (four roads ⇒ Mangrove Ocean City\n\nFoul Bay) ⇒ SBRC (landfill) ⇒ Wildey Depot (return to garage)\n\n                    ▷ Route 2 [ML 278 truck]\n\n                          Wildey Depot (garage) ⇒ City West Region (near Bridge Town Farm Road) ⇒\n\nSBRC (landfill) ⇒ City West Region (return to site)\n\n65\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\f1.2.2.  Main Parameters of the Time-Motion Study\n\nThe  measured  values  for  the  two  routes  are  showed  in  Figure  IV-1  (above).    A\n\ncompactor  truck  with  a  driver  and  two  loaders  were  involved  in  the  Study.    While\n\nmost  of  the  countries  use  high  performance  small  trucks  for  collection  and  large\n\ncontainer-type  trucks  for  transportation,  Barbados  uses  small  compactor  trucks  for\n\nboth  collection  and  transportation.    This  is  because  the  overall  waste  transportation\n\ndistance in Barbados is short.\n\nFor Route 1, the collection site was 14km (19 minutes) from the Depot, and a total\n\nof 10.66 tons of waste was collected from 372 pickups, travelling 14km (299 minutes)\n\nwithin the collection region.    The collected wastes were taken to the landfill and then\n\nthe truck returned to the Depot.    Leaving from the Depot and returning back after the\n\ncollection took a total of 395 minutes and the distance traveled of 67km.    In the case\n\nof Route 1 travelled by the ML 271 truck, the time for one collection was 6.6 hours,\n\nand it was the route that had the 1 trip/day collection frequency so it is recommended\n\nthat a large truck be used for the long distances.\n\nIn  Route  2,  the  travel  distance  was  5km  (11  minutes)  from  the  Depot  to  the\n\ncollection  site,  and  a  total  of  4.72  tons  of  waste  was  collected  travelling  4km  (111\n\nminutes) within the collection site, making 105 pickups.    The collected wastes were\n\ntaken  to  the  landfill  and  then  the  truck  returned  to  the  collection  site  to  collect  the\n\nsecond  batch  of  collection  for  the  day.    Leaving  from  the  Depot  and  returning  back\n\nafter  the  collection  took  a  total  of  173  minutes,  and  the  total  distance  traveled  was\n\n28km.    For  Route  2  where  the  compact  short  distance  truck  ML  278  was  used,  the\n\ntime for one collection was 2.9 hours, and it is the route with the collection frequency\n\nof 2 or 3 trips/day.\n\n[INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK]\n\n66\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\fFigure IV-2 | Parameters for the Time-Motion Study\n\n###### 1.2.3.  Major Results of the Time-Motion Study\n\nAll major deducible results of the Time-Motion Study are presented in Figure IV-2\n\n(above).    The  MHT,  the  most  important  numeric  value  in  this  study,  was  1.84  man\n\nhour/ton which was slightly higher than the average for the outdoor movable or alley\n\ncollection  methods  but  indicated  that  a  comparably  efficient  collection  was  taking\n\nplace.    However,  the  time  it  takes  to  collect  one  ton  of  waste  was  reduced  by  more\n\nthan 1.4 times the standard collection, indicating that the loaders were very efficient.\n\nAs Route 1 and Route 2 were performed one outside the city center and one in the\n\ndowntown  (concentrated)  area  using  either  a  large  truck  or  a  compactor  truck\n\nrespectively, the results of the Time-Motion Study is somewhat different.    In the case\n\nof the city center where there is a densely concentrated population, the time it took to\n\ncollect  one  ton  of  waste  was  less  than  outside  the  city  center,  but  the  volume  per\n\ncollection and time per collection was more than outside the city center.\n\n67\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\fTable IV-4 | Analysis of Time-Motion Study in Barbados\n\nIndex\n\nRoute 1\n\nRoute 2\n\nNo. of Operators\n\n1 driver + 2 loaders\n\n1 driver + 2 loaders\n\nType\n\ncompactor truck\n\ncompactor truck\n\nVehicle\n\nDistance\n\n(km)\n\nOperation Time\n\n(hr/cycle)\n\nCapacity\n\nTravel\n\nCollect\n\n(Total)\n\nTraveling\n\nCollecting\n\n(Total)\n\nNo. of Pick-ups\n\n14.25 tons\n\n5.90 tons\n\n53  ㎞\n\n14  ㎞\n\n67  ㎞\n\n1.60\n\n24  ㎞\n\n  4  ㎞\n\n28  ㎞\n\n1.03\n\n4.98 (Ⓣ 1.40 Ⓒ 3.58)\n\n1.85 Ⓣ 0.40 Ⓒ 1.45)\n\n6.58\n\n372\n\n2.88\n\n105\n\n4.72 ton\n\n0.800\n\nLoads\n\n10.66 ton\n\nActual Loading to Truck Capacity Ratio\n\n0.748\n\nOperating Time Per Ton\n\n0.617 hr/ton\n\n0.610 hr/ton\n\nCollection Time Per Ton\n\nTotal\n\nNet\n\n0.467 hr/ton\n\n0.392 hr/ton\n\n0.336 hr/ton\n\n0.307 hr/ton\n\nCollecting Efficiency (MHT)\n\n1.85 man·hr/ton\n\n1.83 man·hr/ton\n\nCollection/Pick-up\n\n28.65 kg/pick-up\n\n44.95 kg/pick-up\n\nCollection Time/Pick-up\n\nPer Pick-up\n\n0.80 min/pick-up\n\n1.06 min/pick-up\n\nNet Collection Time/Pick-\nup\n\n0.58 min/pick-up\n\n0.83 min/pick-up\n\nOperation Time/Collection Time\n\n1.321\n\n1.557\n\n######### Ⓣ Travel Time within the Collection Region, Ⓒ Actual Collection Time\n\n68\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\fTable IV-5 | Time Required to Collect One Ton of Waste by Bin-type\n\nMoveable Bins\n\nFixed Bins\n\nWall Attachments\n\nOutdoors\n\nIndoors\n\nOutdoors\n\nIndoors\n\nIndoors\n\n45.6 min./ton\n\n57.8 min./ton\n\n60.9 min./ton\n\n69.6 min./ton\n\n74.0 min./ton\n\n##### 1.3. Estimation of the Required Number of Collection Trucks\n\nIt  is  possible  to  estimate  the  total  number  of  trucks  needed  for  waste  transport  in\n\nBarbados  using  the  annual  waste  collection  results  or  the  results  from  the  Time-Motion\n\nStudy  directly,  and  to  determine  the  appropriate  number  using  the  complex  economic\n\nfeasibility evaluation.\n\nThe total waste collected in Barbados for 2014 was 184 tons/day, and in order to estimate\n\nthe required number of trucks to collect this volume, several preconditions must be met.    In\n\nother words, it will be assumed that the total waste collection is 200 tons/day, work hours are\n\nfive days/week at eight hours/day, and the collection trucks will be used for waste collection\n\nand transportation only.\n\n######## ◇ Assumption\n\nwork 8 hrs/day & 5 days/week\n\nneed to collect 200 tons of waste per day\n\n(which is about 10% over the current average of 184 tons per day)\n\n# of trucks = trucks used only for collection & transportation\n\n###### 1.3.1.  Calculation  using  the  2014  Barbados  Waste  Management\n\n####### Results\n\nWhen reviewing the 2014 cleaning operations data for Barbados, it was recorded\n\nthat the trucks made about two trips a day to the landfill bringing in five tons per trip.\n\nAccordingly,  it  was  stated  that  20  trucks  were  used  to  do  this  daily.    Taking  into\n\n69\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\fconsideration  that  Barbados  currently  operates  53%  of  its  trucks,  it  can  be  estimated\n\nthat 38 trucks are needed.\n\n                    Number of trucks needed optimally\n\n                                〓  200 ton/day ÷ [5.00 ton/trip × 2 trips/truck]\n\n                                〓  20 truck/day\n\n                    Actual number of trucks needed using the defect ratio\n\n                                〓  20 trucks ÷ 53%\n\n                                〓  38 trucks/day\n\n###### 1.3.2.  Calculation using the Results of the MHT Directly\n\nThe  waste  collection  trucks  work  8  hours  a  day  with  a  team  of  three  people  per\n\ntruck and the planned collection of 200 tons per day.    So if the MHT value is adjusted\n\naccordingly,  the  number  of  trucks  needed  is  16.    If  the  current  truck  defect  rate  of\n\nBarbados (53%) is considered, then 30 trucks are needed.\n\n                    To collect 200 tons/day,\n\n                    MHT  〓  1.84 man·hrs/ton\n\n                              〓  368 man·hrs/200 tons\n\n                              〓  46 men·8 hrs/200 tons\n\n                              ≒ 16 (3 men) x (8 hrs)/200 tons\n\n                              〓  16 trucks·day/200 tons\n\n    Actual number of trucks needed using the defect ratio\n\n                              〓  16 trucks ÷ 53%\n\n                              〓  30 trucks/day\n\n###### 1.3.3.  Calculation Reflecting the Economic Feasibility\n\nThis method is applied when planning for the number of trucks needed during the\n\ninitial stages of operation or when planning to buy medium or large quantities of trucks\n\nduring  regular  operations.    This  method  is  used  to  determine  how  many  and  what\n\n70\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\fcapacity  trucks  need  to  be  purchased.    However,  instead  of  deciding  the  capacity\n\nthrough  planning,  it  is  expertly  determined  using  the  road  structure  and  collection\n\nsituation  in  many  instances.    Therefore,  this  method  is  suggested  as  a  general\n\nrecommendation instead of explaining the current situation of Barbados.\n\nIn  order  to  decide  on  how  many  and  what  capacity  trucks  are  needed,  it  is\n\nnecessary to apply the method on a variety of trucks.    First of all, a table is made with\n\nrandom  volumes  on  the  vertical  using  the  results  of  the  Time-Motion  Study  or  the\n\nannual operation results for Barbados, where 2, 4, 6, 8…, 18, 20 tons of waste volume\n\nis selected.    In Table IV-6, 0.77 was used as the actual volume by averaging the load\n\nratio  of  Table  IV-4.    Next,  the  total  driving  time  of  Table  4-4  is  proportionally\n\nconsidered and collection frequency for one day (8 hours) is calculated for each truck\n\ncapacity.    Therefore,  the  actual  load  volume  multiplied  by  collection  frequency  will\n\nbe the collection capacity per truck.\n\nThe  overall  collection  volume  is  estimated  as  10.78N2  +  12.32N4  +  13.86N6  +\n\n15.40N10 + 10.78N14.    In Table 4-6, the 8-ton and 12-ton trucks appear to have less\n\ncollection  volume  overall  compared  to  the  other  trucks  with  the  same  collection\n\nfrequency,  so  they  seem  to  be  inefficient,  while  the  trucks  with  a  capacity  for  more\n\nthan 16 tons appear to have less than one collection per day, so they need to be utilized\n\nfor  other  special  purposes  rather  than  for  regular  waste  collections.    Taking  into\n\nconsideration  the  current  waste  collection  situation  in  Barbados,  it  appears  that  the\n\ntrucks needed are the 2-tonners, 4-tonners, 6-tonners, 10-tonners and 14-tonners.\n\n#### Table IV-6 | Step 2 - Determining the Total Collection Weight\n\nTruck\nCapacity\n(tons)\n2\n\nActual Loading\n######## Weight(*1)\n(tons)\n1.54\n\nTrip Per\n######## Day(*2)\n(trips/day)\n7\n\nWaste\nCollected\n(tons/day)\n10.78\n\nRequired\nTruck\nQuantity\nN2\n\nTotal Waste\nCollected\n\n10.78N2\n\n12.32N4\n\n13.86N6\n\n12.32\n\n13.86\n\nN4\n\nN6\n\n12.32\n\nlow efficiency\n\n-\n\n15.40\n\nN10\n\n15.40N10\n\n  9.24\n\nlow efficiency\n\n-\n\n10.78\n\nN14\n\n10.78N14\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n3.08\n\n4.62\n\n6.16\n\n7.70\n\n9.24\n\n10.78\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n71\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\fTruck\nCapacity\n(tons)\n16\n\nActual Loading\n######## Weight(*1)\n(tons)\n12.32\n\nTrip Per\n######## Day(*2)\n(trips/day)\nbelow 1\n\nWaste\nCollected\n(tons/day)\n12.32\n\nRequired\nTruck\nQuantity\nspecial purpose\n\n18\n\n20\n\n13.86\n\n15.40\n\nbelow 1\n\n13.00\n\nspecial purpose\n\nbelow 1\n\n13.00\n\nspecial purpose\n\nTotal Waste\nCollected\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n(*1) using the average of about 77%\n\n(*2) based on 8 hrs (1 day) ÷ operation time (hr/cycle) by the results of the time-motion study [see Table IV-4]\n\nFor Step 2, the total volume of waste collected by the different capacity trucks in\n\nStep 1 must be over 200 tons per day.

Recommendations for Waste Management\n\n##### 2.1. Vehicle Defect\n\nIn looking at the defect ratio situation for waste collection equipment in Barbados, there\n\nare a total of 66 trucks purchased within the last 10 years where 10 of these are in need of\n\nrepairs  and  21  are  damaged  beyond  operation,  making  the  total  of  31  trucks  inoperable.\n\nThis makes the defect ratio for the trucks purchased within 10 years to be 47%, making only\n\n53% operable for waste collection.    This is the most serious problem for Barbados’s waste\n\nmanagement, so the following improvements are recommended:\n\n- There needs to be a special policy for vehicle maintenance and repair.\n\n  (easy  access  to  parts,  specialization  and  privatization  of  vehicle  repair  services,  local\n\nresidency in Barbados of mechanics from truck manufacturers)\n\n- The required number of trucks needs to be secured.\n\n- A fixed number of trucks must be purchased regularly every year according to a plan.\n\n- The durability life of the trucks should be determined so their usage can be legally stopped\n\nafter their lifecycles expire, meaning that a phase-out plan is needed to eventually phase\n\nout old trucks so that the total number of trucks is not distorted..\n\n#### Table IV-8 | Defect Ratio of Collection Trucks\n\n73\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\fYear\n\n1991  1992  1994  1996  1998  1999  2000  2001  2002  2003  Total\n\nIn Use\n\nRepairs\n\nMinor\n\n1\n\nMajor\n\n1\n\n6\n\n3\n\n2\n\n11\n\n6\n\n4\n\n11\n\n21\n\n15\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nTotal\n\nYear\n\nIn Use\n\nRepairs\n\n5\n\n11\n\nTotal\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2013\n\nTotal\n\n15\n\n5\n\n11\n\n31\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n6\n\n3\n\n1\n\n4\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n3\n\n6\n\n9\n\n2\n\n3\n\n14\n\n10\n\n21\n\n35\n\n66\n\n31\n\n##### 2.2. Other Waste Management\n\nThe roads in the Barbados city center is arranged in a grid with many one-way streets,\n\nand  the  intersections  are  roundabouts,  making  it  easy  for  the  garbage  trucks  to  travel.\n\nHowever,  the  local  roads  are  double  lanes  only  with  narrow  tree-type  layouts,  and  since\n\nmany houses are located in dead-end alleys off the main roads, access for the garbage trucks\n\nare quite difficult.\n\nAs the structural characteristics of the roads determine the waste collection method, the\n\nCurb  Service  and  Alley  Service  currently  used  in  Barbados  is  considered  to  be  very\n\nreasonable.    It appears that with the exception of the deficient vehicles, waste management\n\nof Barbados is appropriate and well executed, with the following improvements for reference.\n\n#### Table IV-9 | Comparison of Collection Methods\n\nIndix\n\nType of Collections\n\nCurb\n\nAlley\n\nSet Out-\nSet Back\n\nSet Out\n\nBack Yard\nCarry\n\nResident Cooperation\n\nBins Brought\n\nEmpty Bins Taken\nBack\n\nCollection Plan with the Residents’\nCooperation\n\nProblems in Landscape\nImage\n\nExposure and\nLeakage\n\n○\n\n○\n\n○\n\nrequired\n\nrequired\n\n×\n\n×\n\n×\n\n×\n\n×\n\n○\n\n○\n\n×\n\n×\n\n×\n\nhigh\n\nhigh\n\nlow\n\nhigh\n\nlow\n\n74\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\fGarbage Bins can be\nseen\n\nWork is Easy for the Sanitation Workers and\nAttractive to Scavengers\n\nProne to Upsets\n\nNumber of Workers for Efficiency\n\nCrew Time\n\nInjury Rate of Worker during Garbage\nLoading and Unloading\n\nTrespassing Complaints\n\n○\n\n○\n\n○\n\n1~3\n\nlow\n\nlow\n\nlow\n\nCost for Size and Workers and Work Time\n\nlow\n\n×\n\nvery\nfamiliar\n\n○\n\n1~3\n\nlow\n\nlow\n\nlow\n\nlow\n\n×\n\n×\n\n×\n\n3~7\n\nhigh\n\nhigh\n\n○\n\n×\n\n○\n\n1~5\n\nmid\n\nmid\n\n×\n\n×\n\n×\n\n3~5\n\nmid\n\nhigh\n\nhigh\n\nhigh\n\nhigh\n\nhigh\n\nmid\n\nmid\n\nSource: Min, et al. (2003). Waste Disposal Engineering. Sae-Hwa Publishers\n\n###### 2.2.1.  Methods to Improve the MHT Efficiency\n\nThe problem with the road structures of Barbados is that they are only double lanes\n\nand many dead-ends.    In other words, the roads outside the city center is developed in\n\nthe  tree  line-type  structure  and  the  houses  are  built  parallel along  the  roads  in  alleys\n\nwith  dead-ends.    The  narrow  roads  are  the  cause  for  traffic  jams  or  traffic  stops\n\nresulting  from  illegal  parking,  but  on  the  other  hand,  the advantage  of  these  roads is\n\nthat garbage collection can be done from both sides of the road simultaneously.\n\nCurrently, the garbage trucks leave the alleys driving backwards due to the dead-\n\nends.    The  road  structure  that  are  the  obstacles  for  waste  collection  need  to  be\n\nimproved with urban planning, but if the dead-ends can be linked together to make a\n\nflow traffic road, garbage collection will be easier.    The following recommendations\n\ncan be presented to help with this problem:\n\n######### -  The dead-end streets can be linked together for flow traffic to make it easy for\n\ngarbage collection (See figure below).\n\n######### -  The residents living on the dead-end streets can bring their garbage voluntarily\n\nto the curbs of the main roads for collection.\n\n######### -  The collection trucks can be equipped with small mobile carts and these carts\n\nare used for the collection.\n\n75\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\fFigure IV-3 | Type of Roads\n\n######### →\n\n[cul-de-sac]\n\n[partially gridiron]\n\nBarbados  used  the  alley  and  curb  collection  services.    By  looking  at  the  Time-\n\nMotion  Study,  the  average  distance  between  garbage  bins  are  38m,  so  as  one  of  the\n\nways to increase collection efficiency, the distances between the bins can be increased\n\nand larger bins can be used.\n\n#### Figure IV-4 | Suggestions on Improvements in Roads\n\n·  ·\n\n·\n\n·\n\n·  ·\n\n  ‥  ‥‥  ‥‥  ‥‥  ‥‥  ‥‥  ‥\n\n  ▣\n\n  ▣\n\n  ▣\n\n######### →\n\n  ‥  ‥‥  ‥‥  ‥‥  ‥‥  ‥‥  ‥\n\n  ▣\n\n  ▣\n\n  ▣\n\n  ▣\n\n·\n\n·  ·\n\n·\n\n·\n\n[alley & curb service]\n\ndistance between bins = 38m\n\n[curb & block service]\n\nFurthermore, if the collection route is transcribed in the order of the district names,\n\nit should be changed into drawings and graphics to make it easy if the loaders change,\n\nso the new loaders can memorize the collection routes better.    To date, the trucks in\n\nBarbados  are  not  equipped  with  GPS  navigators  so  it  seems  like  the  graphic  route\n\nmaps  are  needed,  and  when  the  trucks  get  equipped  with  GPS,  the  collection  routes\n\ncan be displayed on the screens rather than the drawings.\n\n76\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\f2.2.2.  Street  Sweeping  and  Collection  Improvement  for  Narrow\n\n####### Alleys\n\nCurrently,  street sweeping in Barbados is done by  workers with wheeled garbage\n\n######## bins  (60∼120L),  and  narrow  alleys  in  the  city  center  are  cleaned  by  small  tracker-\n\nshaped lorry loaders.    In the case of Korea, automatic water-charged vehicles or rear\n\ncars  are  used  for  street  sweeping.    The  rear  cars  are  more  stable  compared  to  the\n\nwheeled  bins and are  easy  to  use,  with the  advantage  of  having  the  ability  to  link  to\n\nbicycles or motorcycles for power.\n\n#### Figure IV-5 | Equipments for Street Cleaning\n\n###### 2.2.3.  Systemization and Computerization of Waste Management\n\nIt  appears  that  Barbados  needs  to  construct  a  database  on  wastes  for  a  more\n\nadvanced waste management system in the future.    In order to construct the database,\n\nconcerned laws must define what waste is, establish a classification system, and select\n\nthe classification codes to serve as the basis for the computerization.    Afterwards, in\n\norder  to  determine  the  flow  of  the  waste  management  system,  the  waste  generation,\n\n77\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\ftransportation, treatment and disposal process need to be computerized.    The GPS or\n\nRFID can be used partially for this purpose.\n\n######### -  Construction of the database for wastes including the definition, establishment\n\nof the waste system and cataloged (Barbados Waste Code, BWC)\n\n-  Selection of the Classification Codes\n\n-  Computerization  of  the  waste  generation,  transportation,  treatment,  and\n\ndisposal process (computerization, Just-in-Time Record System)\n\n-  Regular conduction of statistical surveys on wastes\n\n-  Application of the GPS and RFID systems and optimization of routes\n\n###### 2.2.4.  Waste Collection\n\nImprovements for the waste collection are as follows:\n\n######### -  Collection  bags  and  bins  need  to  be  standardized  for  easy  and  efficient\n\ncollection.\n\n######### -  Existing  defect  ratio  of  trucks  needs  be  improved  by  using  various  types  of\n\ncollection trucks\n\n######### -  Instead  of  just  using  collection  region  information  as  route  information,  the\n\nactual road routes used by the collection trucks should be mapped out onto a\n\nmap for better visual management and checking of route coverage.\n\n######### -  It  will  be  difficult  to  improve  on  the  current  collection  routes  because  the\n\ndrivers  have  currently  optimized their driving  routes  to  be  the most  optimum\n\naccording  to  the  region  of  their  pick-up.    Therefore,  a  GPS-based  tracking\n\nsystem is not needed in order to optimize the collection routes.\n\n######### -  Automatic  Pipeline  Collection  System  could  be  considered  the  in  the  city\n\ncenter  with  a  high  population  density  in  order  to  improve  the  waste\n\nadministration and collection efficiency\n\n######### -  RFID-based tracking system for medical waste could be considered in order to\n\ntrack the whole collection and disposal process of medical waste.\n\n78\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\f2.2.5.  Waste Treatment and Disposal\n\nImprovements for waste treatment and disposal are as follows:\n\n-  The re-using and recycling can be optimized with realized policies.\n\n-  Automated  sorting  devices  should  be  installed  at  the  disposal  or  recycling\n\ntransshipment depots to efficiently promote the 3Rs.\n\n-  Reclaim the methane gas from the existing landfill\n\n-  The burying amount can be minimized and the life durability of the landfill can\n\nbe extended by digging and reorganizing the existing landfill.\n\n######### -  The Waste-to-Energy Policy should be established.    In the case for Barbados,\n\nit  is  possible  to  produce  450  tons/day  of  92%  combustible  MSW  and  300\n\ntons/day  of  RDF  (Refuse  Derived  Fuels).    With  heat  (100  tons/day  x  3\n\nincinerators) treatment, it will be possible to produce 10MW of electricity, 25\n\nGcal/hr of heat, and 10,000 USRT of cold air.\n\n#### Figure IV-6 | Waste-to-Energy Planst Process\n\nMSW 450 tons/day\n\n(combustible 92%)\n\nwastes\n\n######### →\n\n######### →\n\nRDF 300 tons/day\n\n(LHV 3,500kcal/kg)\n\nfuels\n\n######### →\n\n######### →\n\n- 10MW electricity\n- 25 Gcal/hr heat\n- 10,000 USRT cold air\n\nenergy\n\n[INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK]\n\n79\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\f3.  Economic Feasibility Analysis\n\n##### 3.1. Method of Analysis\n\nIn  this  section,  the  economic  feasibility  analysis  of  the  purchasing  15  additional\n\ncollection trucks is performed using benefit-cost analysis.    For this purpose, social benefit\n\nand  cost  of  the  purchase  are  estimated,  and  the  economic  feasibility  is  analyzed  using  Net\n\nPresent Value (NPV) Method, Economic Internal Return Rate (EIRR), and Benefit/Cost ratio\n\n(B/C ratio).\n\nThe  NPV  method  is  the  most  widely  used  technique  for  economic  feasibility  analysis.\n\nNPV is the sum of present value (PV) cash inflows subtracted by the sum of present value\n\n(PV)  cash  outflows.    When  the  NPV  value  in  the  formula  is  greater  than  0,  the  project  is\n\nconsidered as economically feasible.    Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) or Internal\n\nRate  of  Return  (IRR)  provides  a  discount  rate  that  equals  the  sum  of  present  value  cash\n\ninflows  and  the  sum  of  present  value  cash  outflows.    As  a  decision  criterion  to  economic\n\nfeasibility, the EIRR of an investment alternative needs to be greater than social discount rate\n\n(social  discount  rate  in  the  analysis  is  12%).    Benefit/Cost  Ratio  shows  the  ratio  of  the\n\nbenefit value of a project relative to its cost value.    Since the NPV values are influenced by\n\nthe  volume  of  investment,  B/C  ratio  is  used  complementary.    When  a  B/C  ratio  is  larger\n\nthan 1, the investment alternative is economically feasible.\n\nIn  addition  sensitivity  analysis  was  also  performed  to  analyze  the  sensitivity  of  the\n\ninvestment relative to changes in the discount rate, the overall costs, and the overall benefits.\n\n##### 3.2. Assumptions Used for the Analysis\n\n###### 3.2.1.  Inflation Rate\n\nWe  used  the  average  Barbados  inflation  rate  compiled  by  the  IMF  from  2012  to\n\n2014  as  the  inflation  rate  that  will  be  applied  to  the  estimation  of  the  various  future\n\nvalues for the economic feasibility analysis.\n\n80\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\fTable IV-10 | Inflation Rate of Barbados\n\nYear\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n3 -Year Average\n\nInflation Rate\n\n1.823\n\n1.868\n\n1.199\n\n1.630\n\n(Unit: %)\n\nSource: IMF. (2015). World Economic Data. IMF\n\n###### 3.2.2.  Period of Analysis\n\nWe  assumed  that  5  collection  trucks  will  be  purchased  every  year  for  3  years\n\nstarting 2016 for a total of 15 new trucks being purchased within the three year period.\n\nThe reason for the purchase of 15 new trucks is assumed from the recommendations\n\nfor  the  number  of  operational  trucks  (Section  IV.1)  where  the  minimum  number  of\n\nrequired  trucks  was  calculated  as  being  over  30  trucks  and  currently  there  are  only\n\nabout 15 trucks that are operational at this moment for the SSA.\n\nThe start of the benefits obtained from the purchasing of new collection trucks was\n\nassumed  to  be  from  2017  which  is  one  year  after  the  initial  purchase  in  2016.    The\n\ntotal  period  for  the  benefits  to  arise  was  assumed  to  be  10  years  after  the  initial\n\npurchase.    Salaries  for  drivers  and  loaders,  cost  of  gasoline,  and  maintenance  costs\n\nfor the trucks were assumed to occur every year after the purchase of the new trucks;\n\nthe total period of the economic feasibility analysis is 13 years from 2016 to 2028.\n\n###### 3.2.3.  Discount Rate\n\nWe applied 12% as the discount rate for the economic feasibility analysis because\n\n12%  is  the  standard  discount  rate  used  by  the  Export-Import  Bank  of  Korea  for  all\n\ntheir financial analysis of developing countries.\n\n[INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK]\n\n81\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\f3.3.

Benefit Analysis\n\n###### 3.4.1.  Benefit Components\n\nThe following benefits are expected to arise with the purchase of 15 new collection\n\ntrucks:\n\n######### -  Prevention  of  decrease  in  tourism  due  to  environmentally  unhealthy  and\n\nvisually  unclean  situations  that  might  be  caused  by  deficiencies  in  waste\n\ncollection from key tourist attractions, and\n\n######### -  Reduction in salary from not working over-time in week-ends\n\n83\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\f3.4.2.  Benefit Details\n\n1) The money savings arising from the prevention of the decrease in tourism can\n\n  be used as a benefit for purchasing new collection trucks because there was a case\n\nin Napoli, Italy where tourism income dropped significantly in 2008 due to problems\n\nin waste collection and street cleaning.\n\nThe benefit obtained in terms of prevention of the decrease in tourism can be\n\n  calculated using the following formula:\n\n  benefit = (number of new trucks) x (average yearly income from tourism) x\n\n      (percentage of decrease in tourism with shortage of one truck) x\n\n      (1 + inflation rate)\n\n  where\n\npercentage of decrease in tourism with shortage of one truck was\n\nassumed to be 0.01% and average yearly income from tourism was\n\nassumed to be USD 1.098 Billion (www.wttc.org).\n\n: Year 2017\n\nbenefit = 5 x USD 1.098 B x 0.01%    = USD 549,000\n\n: Year 2018\n\n######## benefit = 10 x USD 1.098 B x 0.001%    x inflation\n\n= USD 1,116,000\n\n: Year 2019 to Year 2028\n\n######## benefit    = 15 x USD 1.098 B x 0.001%    x inflation\n\n2) With more collection trucks, SSA personnel do not have to work on weekends\n\n  which translates to savings in over-time payments.\n\nThe benefit obtained in terms reduction in over-time salary can be calculated using\n\n  the following formula:\n\n  benefit = (number of new trucks) x (average daily salary of SSA workers) x\n\n      (number of workers per truck) x (number of days of over-time per year)\n\nx 1.5 x (1 + inflation rate)\n\n  where\n\naverage daily salary of SSA workers was assumed to be USD 100 per\n\n84\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\fday (USD 24,000 yearly income from data received from SSA which\n\nis equal to the per capita GDP of Barbados in 2014, www.indexmundi.\n\ncom) and the number of days of over-time was assumed to be 4 days\n\nper month.\n\n: Year 2017\n\nbenefit    = 5 x USD 100 x 3 x 1.5 x 48 days = USD 108,000\n\n: Year 2018\n\nbenefit    = 10 x USD 100 x 3 x 1.5 x 48 days    x inflation\n\n: Year 2019 to Year 2028\n\nbenefit    = 15 x USD 100 x 3 x 1.5 x 48 days\n\n= USD 219,000\n\nx inflation\n\n###### 3.4.3.

Conclusions and Suggestions\n\nThe general assessment of services provided by the Sanitation Services Authority (SSA)\n\nof Barbados related to waste collection, disposal and management is that they are currently\n\ndoing  a  very  good  job  in  all  areas  of  waste  collection,  disposal  and  management.    SSA’s\n\ndrivers and loaders are very hard working and the managers are dedicated in providing the\n\nbest possible service to the citizens with the limited resources they have available to them.\n\nThe  collection  routes  are  very  efficient  and  it  will  be  hard  to  improve  on  their  current\n\ncollection efficiency.\n\nThe  areas  that  need  improvements  and  upgrades  are  1)  more  effective  means  of\n\nmaintenance  of  collection  trucks,  2)  purchase  of  additional  collection  trucks  to  replace  old\n\nmodel trucks that are not functioning to capacity, 3) mapping out actual collection routes on\n\na map, 4) construction of a leachate treatment facility, 5) construction of a waste-to-energy\n\nplant to incinerate most of the combustible solid waste prior to burial, 6) increased recycling\n\nat the source in order to reduce the amount of waste, 7) designing of a waste code specific to\n\nBarbados, 8) development of a waste database to facilitate data management and retrieval, 9)\n\ndevelopment  of  a  computer  program  for  waste  management,  10)  research  and  analysis  on\n\nsetting  up  intermediary  transfer  stations  throughout  the  island,  11)  standardizing  trash  bins\n\nand  garbage  bags  to  facilitate  collection,  and  12)  developing  metrics  to  measure  the\n\nperformance of collection, transportation and disposal of solid waste.\n\nThe  results  of  this  Consulting  Project  can  be  used to  better  plan  for  future  activities  in\n\nwaste  collection,  disposal  and  management  in  Barbados.    Barbados  is  one  of  the  leading\n\ncountries  in  waste  collection  and  management  in  the  Caribbean  and  hopefully  the  lessons\n\nlearned  through  this  project  can  be  transferred  to  other  countries  in  the  Caribbean.    Our\n\nfinal  proposal  is  for  the  Caribbean  countries  to  form  an  association  related  to  waste\n\nmanagement  throughout  the  Caribbean  so  that  countries  can  share  each  other’s  knowledge\n\nand expertise as well as collectively strategize concerning the future directions pertaining to\n\nwaste management in all Caribbean countries.\n\n89\n\n2015 Joint Consulting with IOs: Inter-American Development Bank(IDB)\n\n\fReferences\n\nAhn, H.
