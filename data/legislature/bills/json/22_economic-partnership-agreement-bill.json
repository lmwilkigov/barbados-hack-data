Where the verification procedure or any other available information appears to indicate that the\nprovisions of this Protocol are being contravened, the exporting country on its own initiative or at\nthe  request  of  the  importing  country  shall  carry  out  appropriate  enquires  or  arrange  for  such\nenquiries to be carried out with due urgency to identify and prevent such contraventions and for this\npurpose  the  exporting  country  concerned  may  invite  the  participation  of  the  importing  country  in\nthese enquiries.\n\nARTICLE 35\n\nVerification of suppliers’ declarations\n\n1. Verification of suppliers’ declarations shall be carried out at random or based on risk analysis or\nwhenever the customs authorities of the importing State have reasonable doubt as to the authenticity\nof the document or the accuracy or completeness of the information concerning the true origin of the\nmaterials in question.\n\n2. The customs authorities to which a supplier’s declaration is submitted may request the customs\nauthorities  of  the  State  where  the  declaration  was  made  to  issue  an  information  certificate,  a\nspecimen of which appears in Annex VI to this Protocol. Alternatively, the customs authorities to\nwhich  a  supplier’s  declaration  is  submitted  may  request  the  exporter  to  produce  an  information\ncertificate issued by the customs authorities of the State where the declaration was made.\n\n194\n\n\fA copy of the information certificate shall be preserved by the office which has issued it for at least\nthree years.\n\n3.  The  customs  authorities  requesting  the  verification  shall  be  informed  of  the  results  thereof  as\nsoon  as  possible.  The results  must  indicate clearly whether the information given in the supplier's\ndeclaration is correct and make it possible for the customs authorities to determine whether and to\nwhat extent this supplier's declaration could be taken into account for issuing a movement certificate\nEUR.1 or for making out an invoice declaration.\n\n4. The verification shall be carried out by the customs authorities of the country where the supplier's\ndeclaration was made out. For this purpose, they shall have the right to call for any evidence or to\ncarry out any inspection of the supplier's account or any other check which they consider appropriate\nin order to verify the correctness of any supplier’s declaration.\n\n5.  Any  movement  certificate  EUR.1  or  invoice  declaration  issued  or  made  out  on  the  basis  of  an\nincorrect supplier’s declaration shall be considered null and void.\n\nARTICLE 36\n\nDispute settlement\n\nWhere disputes arise in relation to the verification procedures of Articles 34 and 35 which cannot be\nsettled  between  the  customs  authorities  requesting  a  verification  and  the  customs  authorities\nresponsible for carrying out this verification or where they raise a question as to the interpretation of\nthis Protocol, they shall be submitted to the Special Committee on Customs Cooperation and Trade\nFacilitation.\n\nIn  all  cases  the  settlement  of  disputes  between  the  importer  and  the  customs  authorities  of  the\nimporting country shall take place under the legislation of that country.\n\nARTICLE 37\n\nPenalties\n\nPenalties  shall  be  imposed  on  any  person  who  draws  up,  or  causes  to  be  drawn  up,  a  document\nwhich  contains  incorrect  information  for  the  purpose  of  obtaining  a  preferential  treatment  for\nproducts.\n\nARTICLE 38\n\nFree zones\n\n1. The CARIFORUM States and the EC Party shall take all necessary steps to ensure that products\ntraded  under  cover  of  a  proof  of  origin  or  a  supplier’s  declaration  and  which  in  the  course  of\ntransport  use  a  free  zone  situated  in  their  territory,  are  not  substituted  by  other  goods  and  do  not\nundergo handling other than normal operations designed to prevent their deterioration.\n\n2. By means of an exemption to the provisions contained in paragraph 1, when originating products\nare imported into a free zone under cover of a proof of origin and undergo treatment or processing,\nthe authorities concerned shall issue a new movement certificate EUR.1 at the exporter’s request, if\nthe treatment or processing undergone complies with the provisions of this Protocol.\n\n195\n\n\fARTICLE 39\n\nDerogations\n\n1.  Derogations  from  this  Protocol  may  be  adopted  by  the  Special  Committee  on  Customs\nCooperation  and  Trade  Facilitation,  hereafter  in  this  Article  referred  to  as  \"the  Committee\",  in\nfavour of products exported from the CARIFORUM States.\n\n2. Derogations from this Protocol may be adopted where the development of existing industries or\nthe creation of new industries in the CARIFORUM States justifies the adoption of such derogations.\n\n3.  The  CARIFORUM  State  or  States  concerned  shall,  either  before  or  when  the  request  for\nderogation  is  submitted  to  the  Committee,  notify  the  EC  Party  of  its  request  for  a  derogation\ntogether with the reasons for the request in accordance with paragraph 5.\n\n4.  The  EC  Party  shall  respond  positively  to  all  the  CARIFORUM  States'  requests  which  are  duly\njustified in conformity with this Article and which cannot cause serious injury to an established EC\nParty industry.\n\n5.  In  order  to  facilitate  the  examination  by  the  Committee  of  requests  for  derogation,  the\nCARIFORUM State or States making the request shall, by means of the form given in Annex VII to\nthis  Protocol,  furnish  in  support  of  their  request  the  fullest  possible  information  covering  in\nparticular the following:\n\n– description of the finished product,\n\n– nature and quantity of materials originating in third countries,\n\n– nature and quantity of materials originating in CARIFORUM States or the countries or territories\nreferred  to  in  Articles  3  and  4,  or  the  materials  which  have  been  processed  in  these  countries  or\nterritories,\n\n– manufacturing processes,\n\n– added value achieved,\n\n– number of employees in the enterprise concerned,\n\n– anticipated volume of exports to the EC Party,\n\n– other possible sources of supply for raw materials,\n\n– reasons for the duration requested in the light of efforts made to find new sources of supply,\n\n– other observations.\n\nThe Committee may modify the form.\n\n6. The examination of requests for derogation shall in particular take into account:\n\n196\n\n\f(a)  the  level  of  development  or  the  geographical  situation  of  the  CARIFORUM  State  or  States\nconcerned;\n\n(b) cases where the application of the existing rules of origin would significantly affect the ability of\nan  existing  industry  in  a  CARIFORUM  State  or  States  to  continue  their  exports  to  the  EC  Party,\nwith particular reference to cases where this could lead to cessation of its activities;\n\n(c)  specific  cases  where  it  can  be  clearly  demonstrated  that  significant  investment  in  an  industry\ncould  be  deterred  by  the  rules  of  origin  and  where  a  derogation  favouring  the  realization  of  the\ninvestment programme would enable these rules to be satisfied by stages.\n\n7. In every case an examination shall be made to ascertain whether the rules relating to cumulation\nof origin do not provide a solution to the problem.\n\n8. The Committee shall take steps necessary to ensure that a decision on a request for derogation is\nreached  as  soon  as  possible  and,  in  any  case,  not  later  than  seventy-five  working  days  after  the\nrequest is received by the EC Party. If the EC Party does not inform the CARIFORUM State of its\nposition on the request within this period, the request shall be deemed to have been accepted.\n\n(a) The derogation shall be valid for a period, generally of five years, to be determined by the\n\n9.\nCommittee.\n\n(b)  The  derogation  decision  may  provide  for  renewals  without  a  new  decision  of  the\nCommittee  being  necessary,  provided  that  the  CARIFORUM  State  or  States  concerned  submit,\nthree months before the end of each period, proof that they are still unable to meet the conditions of\nthis Protocol which have been derogated from.\n\nIf any objection is made to the extension, the Committee shall examine it as soon as possible and\ndecide  whether  to  prolong  the  derogation.  The  Committee  shall  proceed  as  provided  for  in\nparagraph 8. All necessary measures shall be taken to avoid interruptions in the application of the\nderogation.\n\n(c)  In  the  periods  referred  to  in  subparagraphs  (a)  and  (b),  the  Committee  may  review  the\nterms for implementing the derogation should a significant change be found to have taken place in\nthe substantive factors governing the decision to grant the derogation. On conclusion of its review\nthe Committee may decide to amend the terms of its decision as regards the scope of derogation or\nany other condition previously laid down.\n\nTITLE VI\n\nCEUTA AND MELILLA\n\nARTICLE 40\n\nSpecial conditions\n\n1. The term \"EC Party\" used in this Protocol does not cover Ceuta and Melilla. The term \"products\noriginating in the EC Party\" does not cover products originating in Ceuta and Melilla.\n\n197\n\n\f2.  The  provisions  of  this  Protocol  shall  apply  mutatis  mutandis  in  determining  whether  products\nmay be deemed as originating in a CARIFORUM State when imported into Ceuta and Melilla.\n\n3.  Where  products  wholly  obtained  in  Ceuta,  Melilla  or  in  the  EC  Party  undergo  working  and\nprocessing in a CARIFORUM State, they shall be considered as having been wholly obtained in a\nCARIFORUM State.\n\n4.  Working  or  processing  carried  out  in  Ceuta,  Melilla  or  in  the  EC  Party  shall  be  considered  as\nhaving  been  carried  out  in  a  CARIFORUM  State,  when  materials  undergo  further  working  or\nprocessing in a CARIFORUM State.\n\n5. For the purpose of implementing paragraphs 3 and 4, the insufficient operations listed in Article 8\nof this Protocol shall not be considered as working or processing.\n\n6. Ceuta and Melilla shall be considered as a single territory.\n\nTITLE VII\n\nFINAL PROVISIONS\n\nARTICLE 41\n\nAmendment of the Protocol\n\nThe Joint CARIFORUM-EC Council may decide to amend the provisions of this Protocol.\n\nARTICLE 42\n\nTasks of the Special Committee on Customs Cooperation and Trade Facilitation\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  Article  36  of  the  Agreement  the  Special  Committee  on\nCustoms Cooperation and Trade Facilitation shall:\n\n(a) take decisions on cumulation under the conditions laid down in Article 5;\n\n(b) take decisions on derogations from this Protocol under the conditions laid down in Article 39.\n\n(c) monitor the implementation and the administration of the provisions of this Protocol.\n\nARTICLE 43\n\nReview\n\nThe Parties shall review the provisions of paragraph 4 of Article 2 and of paragraph 4 of Article 4\nafter three years from the signature of this Agreement with a view to reducing the products listed in\nAnnex X to this Protocol\n\nARTICLE 44\n\n198\n\n\fThe Annexes to this Protocol shall form an integral part thereof.\n\nAnnexes\n\n199\n\n\fANNEX I TO PROTOCOL I\n\n## Introductory notes to the list in Annex II1\n\nNote 1:\n\nThe list sets out the conditions required for all products to be considered as sufficiently worked or\nprocessed within the meaning of Article 7 of the Protocol.\n\nNote 2:\n\n1.\n\nThe  first  two  columns  in  the  list  describe  the  product  obtained.    The  first  column  gives  the\nheading  number  or  chapter  number  used  in  the  Harmonized  System  and  the  second  column\ngives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter.  For each entry\nin the first two columns a rule is specified in columns 3 or 4.  Where, in some cases, the entry\nin the first column is preceded by an \"ex\", this signifies that the rules in columns 3 or 4 apply\nonly to the part of that heading as described in column 2.\n\n2.  Where  several  heading  numbers  are  grouped  together  in  column  1  or  a  chapter  number  is\ngiven  and  the  description  of  products  in  column 2  is  therefore  given  in  general  terms,  the\nadjacent rules in columns 3 or 4 apply to all products which, under the Harmonized System,\nare  classified  in  headings  of  the  chapter  or  in  any  of  the  headings  grouped  together  in\ncolumn 1.\n\n3.  Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each\nindent  contains  the  description  of  that  part  of  the  heading  covered  by  the  adjacent  rules  in\ncolumns 3 or 4.\n\n4.  Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3 and 4, the\nexporter may opt, as an alternative, to apply either the rule set out in column 3 or that set out\nin  column 4.    If  no  origin  rule  is  given  in  column 4,  the  rule  set  out  in  column 3  has  to  be\napplied.\n\nNote 3:\n\n1.\n\nThe  provisions  of  Article  7  of  the  Protocol  concerning products having acquired originating\nstatus  which  are  used  in  the  manufacture  of  other  products  apply  regardless  of  whether  this\nstatus has been acquired inside the factory where these products are used or in another factory\nin the EC Party or in the CARIFORUM States.\n\nExample:\n\nAn engine of heading No 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating\nmaterials  which  may  be  incorporated  may  not  exceed  40 per  cent  of  the  ex-works  price,  is\nmade from \"other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging\" of heading No ex 7224.\n\nIf  this  forging  has  been  forged  in  the  EC  Party  from  a  non-originating  ingot,  it  has  already\nacquired  originating  status  by  virtue  of  the  rule  for  heading  No  ex  7224  in  the  list.    The\n\n1 All examples are given for the purpose of explanation only. They are not legally binding.\n\n200\n\n\fforging  can  then  count  as  originating  in  the  value  calculation  for  the  engine  regardless  of\nwhether it was produced in the same factory or in another factory in the EC Party.  The value\nof  the  non-originating  ingot  is  thus  not  taken  into  account  when  adding  up  the  value  of  the\nnon-originating materials used.\n\n2.\n\nThe rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required and the\ncarrying  out  of  more  working  or  processing  also  confers  originating  status;  conversely,  the\ncarrying out of less working or processing cannot confer originating status. Therefore, if a rule\nprovides that non-originating material at a certain level of manufacture may be used, the use\nof such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed and the use of such material at a\nlater stage is not.\n\n3.  Without prejudice to Note 3.2 where a rule states that \"materials of any heading\" may be used,\nmaterials  of  the  same  heading  as  the  product  may  also  be  used,  subject,  however,  to  any\nspecific  limitations  which  may  also  be  contained  in  the  rule.  However,  the  expression\n\"manufacture  from  materials  of  any  heading,  including  other  materials  of  heading  No  ...\"\nmeans  that  only  materials  classified  in  the  same  heading  as  the  product  of  a  different\ndescription than that of the product as given in column 2 of the list may be used.\n\n4.  When  a  rule  in  the  list  specifies  that  a  product  may  be  manufactured  from  more  than  one\nmaterial, this means that any one or more materials may be used.  It does not require that all\nbe used.\n\nExample:\n\nThe rule for fabrics of heading Nos 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may be used and\nthat  chemical  materials,  among  other  materials,  may  also  be  used.   This  does  not  mean  that\nboth have to be used; it is possible to use one or the other or both.\n\n5.  Where  a  rule  in  the  list  specifies  that  a  product  must  be  manufactured  from  a  particular\nmaterial, the condition obviously does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of\ntheir inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule.  (See also Note 6.3 below in relation to textiles).\n\nExample:\n\nThe rule for prepared foods of heading No 1904 which specifically excludes the use of cereals\nand their derivatives does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives\nwhich are not products from cereals.\n\nHowever, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured from\nthe  particular  materials  specified  in  the  list,  can  be  produced  from  a  material  of  the  same\nnature at an earlier stage of manufacture.\n\nExample:\n\nIn  the  case  of  an  article  of  apparel  of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven materials, if the\nuse of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible to start\nfrom  non-woven  cloth  – even  if  non-woven  cloth  cannot  normally  be  made  from  yarn.    In\nsuch cases, the starting material would normally be at the stage before yarn – that is the fibre\nstage.\n\n201\n\n\f6.  Where,  in  a  rule  in  the  list,  two  percentages  are  given  for  the  maximum  value  of\nnon-originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be added together.\nIn  other  words,  the  maximum  value  of  all  the  non-originating  materials  used  may  never\nexceed the highest of the percentages given.  Furthermore, the individual percentages must not\nbe exceeded in relation to the particular materials they apply to.\n\nNote 4:\n\n1.\n\n2.\n\n3.\n\n4.\n\nThe term \"natural fibres\" is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic\nfibres.  It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless\notherwise specified, includes fibres that have been carded, combed or otherwise processed but\nnot spun.\n\nThe  term  \"natural  fibres\"  includes horsehair of heading No 0503, silk of heading Nos  5002\nand 5003 as well as the wool fibres, fine or coarse animal hair of heading Nos  5101 to 5105,\nthe cotton fibres of heading Nos 5201 to 5203 and the other vegetable fibres of heading Nos\n5301 to 5305.\n\nThe  terms  \"textile  pulp\", \"chemical  materials\"  and  \"paper-making materials\" are used in the\nlist  to  describe  the  materials  not  classified  in  Chapters  50  to  63,  which  can  be  used  to\nmanufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.\n\nThe term \"man-made staple fibres\" is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament\ntow, staple fibres or waste, of heading Nos  5501 to 5507.\n\nNote 5:\n\n1.  Where for a given product in the list a reference is made to this note, the conditions set out in\ncolumn  3  shall  not  be  applied  to any basic textile materials, used in the manufacture of this\nproduct, which, taken together, represent 10 per cent or less of the total weight of all the basic\ntextile materials used.  (See also Notes 5.3 and 5.4 below).\n\n2.  However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may only be applied to mixed products which\n\nhave been made from two or more basic textile materials.\n\nThe following are the basic textile materials:\nI.             silk,\nwool,\nII.\ncoarse animal hair,\nIII.\nfine animal hair,\nIV.\nhorsehair,\nV.\ncotton,\nVI.\npaper-making materials and paper,\nVII.\nflax,\nVIII.\ntrue hemp,\nIX.\njute and other textile bast fibres,\nX.\nsisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,\nXI.\ncoconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,\nXII.\nsynthetic man-made filaments,\nXIII.\nartificial man-made filaments,\nXIV.\ncurrent conducting filaments\nXV.\n\n202\n\n\fsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene,\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester,\n\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile,\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide,\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene,\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polyphenylene sulphide,\n\nXVI.\nXVII.\nXVIII.  synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide,\nXIX.\nXX.\nXXI.\nXXII.\nXXIII.  synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyvinyl chloride,\nXXIV.  other synthetic man-made staple fibres,\nXXV.\nXXVI.  other artificial man-made staple fibres,\nXXVII.  yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether whether or\n\nartificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,\n\nnot gimped,\n\nXXVIII. yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester whether or\n\nnot gimped,\n\nXXIX.  products  of  heading  No  5605  (metallized  yarn)  incorporating  strip  consisting  of  a\ncore  of  aluminium  foil  or  of  a  core  of  plastic  film  whether  or  not  coated  with\naluminium  powder,  of  a  width  not  exceeding  5  mm,  sandwiched  by  means  of  a\ntransparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film,\n\nXXX.  other products of heading No 5605.\n\nExample:\n\nA yarn of heading No 5205 made from cotton fibres of heading No 5203 and synthetic staple\nfibres of heading No 5506 is a mixed yarn.  Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres\nthat do not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or\ntextile pulp) may be used up to a weight of 10 per cent of the yarn.\n\nExample:\n\nA  woollen  fabric  of  heading  No  5112  made  from  woollen  yarn  of  heading  No  5107  and\nsynthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading No 5509 is a mixed fabric.  Therefore synthetic yarn\nwhich does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or\ntextile pulp) or woollen yarn that does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture\nfrom  natural  fibres,  not  carded  or  combed  or  otherwise  prepared  for  spinning)  or  a\ncombination of the two may be used provided their total weight does not exceed 10 per cent of\nthe weight of the fabric.\n\nExample:\n\nTufted  textile  fabric  of  heading  No  5802  made  from  cotton  yarn  of  heading  No 5205  and\ncotton fabric of heading No 5210 is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed\nfabric being made from yarns classified in two separate headings or if the cotton yarns used\nare themselves mixtures.\n\nExample:\n\nIf the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading No 5205 and\nsynthetic  fabric  of  heading  No  5407,  then,  obviously,  the  yarns  used  are  two  separate  basic\ntextile materials and the tufted textile fabric is accordingly a mixed product.\n\n203\n\n\f3.\n\n4.\n\nIn  the  case  of  products  incorporating  \"yarn  made  of  polyurethane  segmented  with  flexible\nsegments of polyether whether or not gimped\" this tolerance is 20 per cent in respect of this\nyarn.\n\nIn the case of products incorporating \"strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core\nof plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm,\nsandwiched by means of an adhesive between two layers of plastic film\", this tolerance is 30\nper cent in respect of this strip.\n\nNote 6:\n\n1.\n\nIn the case of those textile products, which are marked in the list by a footnote referring to this\nIntroductory  Note, textile  trimmings  and  accessories  which  do  not  satisfy  the  rule  set  out in\nthe  list  in  column  3  for  the  made  up  products  concerned  may  be  used  provided  that  their\nweight does not exceed 10% of the total weight of all the textile materials incorporated.\n\nTextile  trimmings  and  accessories  are  those  classified  in  Chapters  50  to  63.  Linings  and\ninterlinings are not be regarded as trimmings or accessories.\n\n2.  Any  non-textile trimmings and accessories or other materials used which contain textiles do\nnot have to satisfy the conditions set out in column 3 even though they fall outside the scope\nof Note 3.5.\n\n3.\n\nIn  accordance  with  Note  3.5,  any  non-originating  non-textile  trimmings  and  accessories  or\nother  product,  which  do  not  contain  any  textiles,  may,  anyway,  be  used  freely  where  they\ncannot be made from the materials listed in column 3.\n\nXXXI.

The  Parties  also  recognize  regional\ninfrastructure  as  an  important  tool  to  enable  the  CARIFORUM  States  to  take  full\nadvantage of the opportunities offered by this Agreement.\n\nThe  Parties  reaffirm  the  importance  of  ensuring  the  most  efficient  use  of  development\nfinance  resources,  in  order  to  meet  the  objectives  of  this  Agreement,  to  maximize  its\npotential  and  support  its  proper  implementation,  as  well  as  to  support  the  CARICOM\nDevelopment Vision.\n\n## The  Parties  note  the  availability  of  €165  Million  for financing  the  10th  EDF Caribbean\n#### Regional  Indicative  Programme  (CRIP)  and  recall  that  under  the  Revised  Cotonou Agreement,  a  successor  to  the  current  Financial  Protocol  will  be  agreed  for  the  period 2014  –  2020.  The  Parties  further  recognize  that  the  funds  allocated  to  the  Caribbean\n## Regional Indicative Programme (CRIP) in the 10th EDF are to be complemented by Aid\nfor Trade contributions by Member States of the European Union (EU).\n\nPursuant to both the EU Aid for Trade Strategy adopted in October 2007 and the funding\ninstruments enumerated in Article 7 of Part I of this Agreement, the Member States of the\nEuropean  Union  confirm  their  intention  to  ensure  that  an  equitable  share  of  Member\nStates’ Aid for Trade commitments will benefit the Caribbean ACP States, including for\nfunding programmes related to the implementation of this Agreement.\n\nThe  Parties  agree  on  the  benefits  of  regional  development  mechanisms,  including  a\nregional  development  fund,  accessible  to  all  CARIFORUM  States,  to  mobilize  and\nchannel  Economic  Partnership  Agreement  related  development  resources  from  the\nEuropean  Union  and  other  potential  donors.

To prevent disputes arising from confusion\nabout the classification of goods and the tariff applied, a transparent and predictable\nharmonized system of classification is used.  This system, known as the Harmonized\nCommodity Description and Coding System (HS) was developed by members of the\nWorld Customs Organisation.  The classification of the goods used in the schedule\nof tariff liberalization of the CARIFORUM states is based on the HS System.\n\nThe EPA CARIFORUM SCHEDULE\n\n2) The  CARIFORUM  Schedule  of  tariffs  for  the  liberization  of  trade  in  goods\ncontains three elements characterising the schedule which should be considered.\nThese elements are as follows:\n\n1) A  product-by-product  treatment  for  imports  from  the  EU,  that  is,  the\nreduction of tariffs overtime is formulated for each individual product.  Some\nproducts  may  be  excluded  from  liberalization  (denoted  as  \"Excl\"  in  the\nschedule), which allows a country to continue to apply the current tariffs\nindefinitely.  On the other hand, the tariffs of other products will be reduced\nin phases, whereby the current tariff of each of those products will eventually\nbe reduced to zero over a given number of years (either immediate-duty-free\nor elimination in phases of 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 years).\n\n2) For products which will be liberalized, the EPA provides for:\n\na)\n\nA moratorium on reductions where in no tariff reductions will take place\n- three years from the year of provisional application (2008) for all\ngoods, apart from motor vehicles and their parts and gasoline which\nwill enjoy a ten-year moratorium.\n\n######### THE LAWS OF BARBADOS Printed by the Government Printer, Bay Street, St. Michael by the authority of the Government of Barbados\n\n\f352\n\nb)\n\nA 'harmonized\" rate applicable across the region, which is reduced\nover a certain period of time.  The harmonized rate is formulated on the\nbasis of each CARIFORUM Member State's Applied rather than Bound\nTariffs for each product.  Bound Tariffs, particularly in the World Trade\nOrganization (WTO) context, are those which a country has committed\nnot to increase beyond a specific level.  Once a tariff has been bound,\nit can only be raised if all affected parties are suitably compensated.  On\nthe other hand, applied rates are those that are actually applied by the\ncountry concerned which may be equal to the bound rate but may not\nexceed the bound rate.  Countries with applied rates lower than the\nharmonized rate do not need to provide for this higher rate, rather they\ncan begin liberalization when at the 'harmonised\" rate is equal to their\nnational rate.  The EPA schedule does not reflect the national applied\nrates.\n\n3) Country  Specific  Exceptions  (whereby  certain  Member  States  can  either\nimmediately reduce tariffs to zero or maintain tariff rates exceeding the harmonized\nrate, although these must also be phased out over a certain period of time.  Barbados\nis  included  among  a  group  of  signatory  CARIFORUM  States  falling  within  this\ncategory.\n\nNote II\n\n1) The first two columns list goods which are duty free and identified by \"0\", (zero\nrate of duty) on goods imported into CARIFORUM States from the EC or subject to:\n\na)\n\nb)\n\nphased reduction of the most favoured nation (MFN) rate of duty for\nthe period 2009 through 2033, within the meaning of Article 16.1, 16.2\nand 16.3, respectively of the Agreement;\n\nthe list of goods excluded from the phased reduction time table, which\nwould be subject to the application of the MFN Rate of Duty; and\n\nc)\n\nthe list of other goods subject to the MFN Rate of Duty.\n\n2) Also included in the column number 1 (CET HS2007) is the list of country Specific\nExemptions, whereby certain member states can either immediately reduce tariff to\nzero or maintain tariff rates exceeding the harmonized rate, although these must be\nphased out over a certain period of time.  Example Tariff-sub-heading 0207.13.00 Ex.\n The \"Ex\" identifies such products.\n\n3) The first column list the sub-heading number used in the Harmonized System (HS)\nup to the eight digit levels.  The second column specifies the product description for\neach sub-heading while the third specifies the treatment to be applied to imports over\na period of 25 years.\n\n\f353\n\n4) The third, fourth and fifth columns specifies, respectively, (i) the EPA Treatment\nto be applied to imports under any specific Tariff heading over a maximum of twenty-\nfive years, (2) the Common External Tariff (CET) Rate of duty applicable to each tariff\nheading on imports from the EC starting from the base year of 2007; and (3) the\napplied CET rate of duty for each tariff heading from the base period of 2004 to 2008.\n\n5) The columns numbered 6 through 22 represent the liberalized time frames from 1st\nJanuary, 2009 through 1st January, 2033 up to 25 years.  The tariff treatment in these\ncolumns is reflected by the rates of duty expressed as percentages to be applied\nagainst the good overtime (2009 through 2033).  The values in the row correspond to\nparticular timeframes expressed in the columns at the top of the page.  These timeframes\nare expressed in ascending order in two year intervals starting from the year 2009 and\nending with the year 2033.\n\n6) The  value  in  the  row  must  be  checked  against  the  corresponding  timeframe.\nTherefore, the very first value in the row reflects the duty that will be applied to the\ngood from 1st January, 2009.  The second value reflects the duty to be applied from the\n1st January, 2011 etc.  The duties to be applied will gradually decline to zero overtime.\nValues  expressed  as  zero  (0)  mean  that  the  item  is  duty  free  upon  entering\nCARIFORUM.  The bolded term \"Excl\" in the column EPA Treatment is used to\nexpress  that  CARIFORUM  States  have  excluded  this  item  from  liberalization\nindefinitely.\n\n7) It should also be noted that some CARIFORUM States are allowed to reduce\ntariffs to zero immediately or may choose to maintain higher-than-the-maximum\ntariffs on specific goods.  Such allowances are referred to as \"Exceptions\", and are\nnoted  in  the  HS  CET  column  by  abbreviation  \"Ex\"  following  the  particular  HS\nsub-heading number.  Example HS sub-heading number 0207.13.00 Ex Offal fresh or\nchilled.\n\n######### THE LAWS OF BARBADOS Printed by the Government Printer, Bay Street, St. Michael by the authority of the Government of
