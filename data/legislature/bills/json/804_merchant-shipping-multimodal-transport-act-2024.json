at the time of the loss, damage or event or circumstance causing delay, if\nthe provisions of the international instrument\n\n(a)\n\nwould have applied to all or any of the carrier’s activities if the shipper\nhad made a separate and direct contract with the carrier in respect of\nthe particular stage of carriage where the loss of, or damage to goods,\nor an event or circumstance causing delay in their delivery occurred;\n\n(b)\n\nspecifically provide for the carrier’s liability, limitation of liability or\ntime for suit; and\n\n\f42\n\n(c)\n\ncannot be departed from by contract either at all or to the detriment of\nthe shipper under that instrument.\n\nPART VII\n\nOBLIGATIONS OF THE SHIPPER TO THE CARRIER\n\nDelivery for carriage\n\n37.(1)\n\nA shipper shall deliver goods in such a

record.\n\nDeficiencies in the contract particulars\n\nThe absence or inaccuracy of a contract particular referred to in section\n49.(1)\n46 does not affect the legal character or validity of the transport document or of\nthe electronic transport record.\n\nIf contract particulars include a date but fail to indicate its significance, the\n\n(2)\ndate is deemed to be\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nif the

party\n(3)\nin a closed container or vehicle, or when they are delivered in a closed container\nor vehicle and a carrier or performing party inspects them, the carrier may qualify\nthe information referred to in section 46(1), if\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe carrier had no physically practicable or commercially reasonable\nmeans of checking the information furnished by the shipper, in which\ncase it may indicate which information it was unable to check; or\n\nthe carrier has reasonable grounds to believe the information furnished\nby the shipper to be inaccurate, in which case it may include a

the\nInternational Monetary Fund for its operations and transactions in effect at the\ndate in question.\n\nIn determining a special drawing right, the value of a national currency of\n(6)\na contracting party that is not a member of the International Monetary Fund is to\nbe calculated in a manner to be determined by that party.\n\n(7)\n\nIn this section,\n\n“unit  of  account”  means  a  special  drawing  right  defined  by  the  International\n\nMonetary Fund.\n\nLimits of liability for loss caused by delay\n\nSubject to subsection (2), compensation for loss of or damage to goods\n70.(1)\ndue to delay shall be calculated in accordance with section 32 and liability for\neconomic loss due to delay is limited to an amount equivalent to two and one-\nhalf times the freight

act\nor omission of the person claiming the benefit that was done with the intent to\ncause the loss or was done recklessly and with knowledge that the loss would\nprobably result.\n\n\f66\n\n(2)\nNeither the carrier nor a person referred to in section 28 is entitled to the\nbenefit of the limitation of liability provided in section 70 if the claimant proves\nthat the delay in delivery resulted from a personal act or omission of the person\nclaiming the benefit that was done with the intent to cause the loss due to delay\nor that was done recklessly and with knowledge that the loss would probably\nresult.\n\nPART XIII\n\nTIME FOR SUIT\n\nPeriod of time for suit\n\nNo  judicial  or  arbitral  proceedings  in  respect  of  claims  or

carrier for the purpose of deciding claims against the carrier\nthat may arise under this Act.\n\nChoice of court agreements\n\n77.(1)\nThe jurisdiction of a court chosen in accordance with section 76(b) is\nexclusive for disputes between the parties to the contract only if the parties so\nagree and the agreement conferring jurisdiction\n\n(a)\n\nis  contained  in  a  volume  contract  that  clearly  states  the  names  and\naddresses of the parties and\n\n(i)\n\nis individually negotiated; or\n\n(ii)\n\ncontains a prominent statement that there is an exclusive choice\nof  court  agreement  and  specifies  the  sections  of  the  volume\ncontract containing that agreement; and\n\n(b)\n\nclearly designates the courts of one contracting party or one or more\nspecific courts of one contracting party.\n\n\f69\n\n(2)\nA person who is not a party to a volume contract is bound by an exclusive\nchoice of court agreement concluded in accordance with subsection (1) only if\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nthe court is in one of the places designated in section 76(a);\n\nthat  agreement  is  contained  in  the  transport  document  or  electronic\ntransport record;\n\nthat person is given timely and adequate notice of the court where the\naction is to be brought and that the jurisdiction of that court is exclusive;\nand\n\n(d)\n\nthe law of that place recognizes that that person may be bound by the\nexclusive choice of court agreement.\n\nActions against the maritime performing party\n\nA plaintiff has the right to institute judicial proceedings under this Act\n78.\nagainst a maritime performing party in a competent court within the jurisdiction\nin which one of the following is situated:\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nthe domicile of the maritime

port in which the maritime performing party performs its activities\nwith respect to the goods.\n\nNo additional bases of jurisdiction\n\n79.\nSubject to sections 76 and 77, no judicial proceedings under this Act\nagainst the carrier or a maritime performing party may be instituted in a court not\ndesignated under section 71 or 73.\n\n\f70\n\nArrest and provisional or protective

or 82, a carrier or a maritime performing party that institutes an\naction seeking a declaration of non-liability or any other action that would deprive\na person of his right to select the forum under section 76 or 78 shall, at the request\nof the defendant, withdraw that action once the defendant has chosen a court\ndesignated under section 76 or 78 where the action may be

state of one contracting party by a court having\njurisdiction under this Act shall be recognized and enforced in the state of the\nother contracting party in accordance with the law of the other contracting party,\nwhen both parties have made a declaration in accordance with section 86.\n\nA court may refuse recognition and enforcement based on the grounds for\n\n(2)\nthe refusal of

carrier;\n\n(ii)\n\nthe place of receipt agreed in the contract of carriage;\n\n(iii)\n\nthe place of delivery agreed in the contract of carriage;\n\n(iv)\n\nthe port where the goods are initially loaded on a ship; or\n\n(v)\n\nthe port where the goods are finally discharged from a ship.\n\nThe designation of the place of arbitration in an agreement is binding for\n(3)\ndisputes between the parties to the agreement, if the agreement is contained in a\nvolume contract that clearly states the names and addresses of the parties and\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nis individually negotiated; or\n\ncontains a prominent statement that there is an arbitration agreement\nand  specifies  the  sections  of  the  volume  contract  containing  the\narbitration agreement.\n\nWhen  an  arbitration  agreement  has  been  concluded  in  accordance  with\n(4)\nsubsection (3), a person who is not a party to the volume contract is bound by the\ndesignation of the place of arbitration in that agreement only if\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nthe place of arbitration designated in the agreement is situated in one\nof the places referred to in subsection (2)(b);\n\nthe  agreement  is  contained  in  the  transport  document  or  electronic\ntransport record;\n\nthe person to be bound is given timely and adequate notice of the place\nof arbitration; and\n\n\f73\n\n(d)\n\napplicable  law  permits  that  person  to  be  bound  by  the  arbitration\nagreement.\n\n(5)\nSubsections (1) to (4) are deemed to be part of every arbitration clause or\nagreement, and any term of a clause or agreement that is inconsistent with them\nis void to the extent of the inconsistency.\n\nWhere the parties in a dispute subject to an arbitration clause are members\n(6)\nof  the  Shipping  Association  of  Barbados  or  another  Barbados-based  private\nsector  shipping  organization,  the  parties  have  been  unable  to  agree  on  an\narbitrator and the arbitration clause or agreement does not otherwise provide for\nthe  selection  or  appointment  of  the  arbitrator,  either  party  may  request  the\nShipping Association of Barbados or other private sector shipping organization\nto  appoint  an  arbitrator,  and  any  arbitrator  so  selected  shall  be  taken  as  the\narbitrator for the dispute between the parties.\n\nArbitration agreement in non-liner transportation\n\nNothing  in  this  Act  affects  the  enforceability  of  an  arbitration\n85.(1)\nagreement in a contract of carriage in non-liner transportation to which this Act\napplies by reason of\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe application of section 12; or\n\nthe parties’ voluntary incorporation of the provisions of this Act in a\ncontract of carriage that would not otherwise be subject to this Act.\n\nNotwithstanding  subsection  (1),  an  arbitration  agreement  in  a  transport\n(2)\ndocument or electronic transport record to which this Act applies by reason of\nthe application of section 12 is subject to this Part, unless the transport document\nor electronic transport record\n\n(a)\n\nidentifies  the  parties  to,  and  the  date  of,  the  charter  party  or  other\ncontract  excluded  from  the  application  of  this  Act  by  reason  of  the\napplication of section 11; and\n\n(b)\n\nincorporates  by  reference  the  clause  in  the  charter  party  or  other\ncontract that contains the terms of the arbitration agreement.\n\n\f74\n\nAgreement to arbitrate after a dispute has arisen\n\nNotwithstanding  the  provisions  of  this  Part  and  Part  XIV,  after  a\n86.\ndispute has arisen, the parties to the dispute may agree to resolve it by arbitration\nin any place.\n\nPART XVI\n\nVALIDITY OF CONTRACTUAL TERMS\n\nGeneral provisions\n\n87.(1)\nis void to the extent that it\n\nUnless otherwise provided in this Act, a term in a contract of carriage\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\n(e)\n\ndirectly or indirectly excludes or limits the obligations of the carrier or\na maritime performing party under this Act;\n\ndirectly or indirectly excludes or limits the liability of the carrier or a\nmaritime performing party for breach of an obligation under this Act;\n\nassigns a benefit of insurance of goods in favour of the carrier or a\nperson referred to in section 28;\n\ndirectly or indirectly excludes, limits or increases the obligations under\nthis  Act  of  the  shipper,  consignee,  controlling  party,  holder  or\ndocumentary shipper; or\n\ndirectly or indirectly excludes, limits or increases the liability of the\nshipper, consignee, controlling party, holder or documentary shipper\nfor breach of any of its obligations under this Act.\n\n\f75\n\nSpecial rules for volume contracts\n\n88.(1)\nNotwithstanding  section  87,  a  volume  contract  to  which  this  Act\napplies  may  provide  for  greater  or  lesser  rights,  obligations  and  liabilities  as\nbetween the carrier and the shipper than those imposed by this Act.\n\n(2)\n\nThis section applies only when\n\n(a)\n\nthe volume contract contains a prominent statement that it derogates\nfrom this Act;\n\n(b)\n\nthe volume contract is\n\n(i)\n\nindividually negotiated; or\n\n(ii)\n\nprominently  specifies  the  sections  of  the  volume  contract\ncontaining the derogations;\n\n(c)\n\nthe shipper is given an opportunity, and notice of the opportunity, to\nconclude a contract of carriage on terms and conditions that comply\nwith this Act without any derogation under subsection (1); and\n\n(d)\n\nthe derogation is neither\n\n(i)\n\nincorporated by reference from another document; nor\n\n(ii)\n\nincluded in a contract of adhesion that is not subject to negotiation.\n\nA  carrier’s  public  schedule  of  prices  and  services,  transport  document,\n(3)\nelectronic transport record or similar document is not a volume contract under\nsection  86(1),  but  a  volume  contract  may  incorporate  such  documents  by\nreference as terms of the contract.\n\nSection 86(1) does not apply to rights and obligations provided in section\n(4)\n24(a)  or  (b),  section  39  or  42,  or  to  liability  arising  from  their  breach  or  any\nliability arising from an act or omission referred to in section 71.\n\n\f76\n\n(5)\nThe terms of a volume contract that derogate from this Act, if the volume\ncontract satisfies the requirements of subsection (2), apply between the carrier\nand any person other than the shipper if\n\n(a)\n\nthe person received information that prominently states that the volume\ncontract derogates from this Act and gave his express consent to be\nbound by the derogations; and\n\n(b)\n\nthe consent is not solely set forth in the carrier’s public schedule of\nprices and services, transport document or electronic transport record.\n\nA party claiming the benefit of a derogation bears the burden of proof that\n\n(6)\nthe conditions for derogation have been fulfilled.\n\nSpecial rules for live animals and certain other goods\n\nNotwithstanding  section  87  and  without  prejudice  to  section  88,  a\n89.(1)\ncontract of carriage may exclude or limit the obligations or the liability of both\nthe carrier and a maritime performing party if\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe goods are live animals; or\n\nthe character or condition of the goods, or the circumstances and terms\nand conditions under which the carriage is to be performed, reasonably\njustify a special agreement, if the contract of carriage is not related to\nordinary commercial shipments made in the ordinary course of trade\nand  no  negotiable  transport  document  or  negotiable  electronic\ntransport record is issued for the carriage of the goods.\n\nAny such exclusion or limitation in relation to live animals will not be\n(2)\neffective if the claimant proves that the loss of or damage to the goods, or delay\nin delivery, resulted from an act or omission of the carrier or of a person referred\nto in section 28\n\n(a)\n\ndone with the intent to cause the loss of or damage to the goods or a\nloss due to delay; or\n\n\f77\n\n(b)\n\ndone recklessly and with knowledge that such a loss or damage would\nprobably result.\n\nPART XVII\n\nMATTERS

nationality of the parties, and includes carriage carried out by states or\nby governmental institutions or organizations.\n\n(2)\n\nThis Part shall not apply to\n\n(a)\n\ncarriage  performed  under

cannot be fulfilled\n\n108.(1)\nIf it is or becomes impossible to carry out the contract in accordance\nwith the terms laid down in the consignment note before the goods reach the place\ndesignated  for  delivery,  the  carrier  shall  ask  for  instructions  from  the  person\nentitled to dispose of the goods in accordance with section 106.\n\nIf the carriage can be carried out under conditions differing from those laid\n(2)\ndown  in  the  consignment  note  and  if  the  carrier  has  been  unable  to  obtain\ninstructions in a reasonable time from the person entitled to dispose of the goods\nin accordance with section 106, the carrier shall take such steps as seem to it to\nbe in the best interests of the person entitled to dispose of the goods.\n\nWhere goods cannot be delivered after arrival\n\n109.(1)\nWhere circumstances prevent the delivery of goods after their arrival\nat  the  place  designated  for  delivery,  the  carrier  shall  ask  the  sender  for  his\ninstructions.\n\n\f87\n\nIf a consignee refuses the goods, the sender may dispose of them without\n\n(2)\nbeing obliged to produce the first copy of the consignment note.\n\n(3)\nIf  a  consignee  has  refused  the  goods,  the  consignee  may  nevertheless\nrequire their delivery so long as the carrier has not received instructions to the\ncontrary from the sender.\n\nWhen  circumstances  preventing  delivery  of  the  goods  arise  after  the\n(4)\nconsignee, in the exercise of a right under section 106(3), has given an order for\nthe goods to be delivered to another person, subsections (1) to (3) shall apply as\nif the consignee were the sender and that other person were the consignee.\n\nCarrier’s entitlement to recover cost pertaining to instructions\n\nA carrier is

the\ncarrier shall not be under any liability except for the exercise of reasonable care\nin the choice of the third party.\n\nIn the circumstances referred to in subsections (2) and (3), the charges

person\n\n(5)\nentitled to dispose of them, if\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nthe goods are perishable or their condition warrants it; or\n\nwhen the storage expenses would be out of proportion to the value of\nthe goods,\n\n\f88\n\nand, after the expiry of a reasonable period, it has not received from the person\nentitled to dispose of the goods instructions to the contrary that can reasonably\nbe carried out.\n\nIf  goods  have  been  sold  under  this  section,  the  proceeds  of  sale,  after\n(6)\ndeduction of the expenses chargeable against the goods, shall be placed at the\ndisposal of the person entitled to dispose of the goods.\n\nIf these charges exceed the proceeds of sale, the carrier is entitled to the\n\n(7)\ndifference.\n\nThe  procedure  for  the  sale  of  goods  shall  be  determined  by  the  law  or\n\n(8)\ncustom of the place where the goods are situated.\n\nLiability of the Carrier\n\nLiability of total or partial loss of goods in the carrier’s care\n\nSubject to
