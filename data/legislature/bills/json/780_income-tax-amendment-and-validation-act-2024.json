period of the\ncompany  ends  and  a  new  one  begins,  the  new  accounting\nperiod  to  end  with  the  end  of  the  true  accounting  period,\n\n\f16\n\nunless  before  then  there  is  a  further  break  under  this\nsubsection; and\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nthe losses of the true accounting period are apportioned to the\ncomponent accounting periods referred to in paragraph (a);\nand\n\nthe amount of total profits for the true accounting period of\nthe company against which group relief may be allowed is\nalso apportioned to the component accounting periods.\n\nAn apportionment under subsection (2) shall be on a time basis\n(3)\naccording  to  the  respective  lengths  of  the  component  accounting\nperiods  except  that,  if  it  appears  that  that  method  would  work\nunreasonably or unjustly, such other methods shall be used as appears\nto the Commissioner just and reasonable.\n\nWhere  the  one  company  is  the  surrendering  company  and  the\n(4)\nother company is the claimant company references in subsection (1) to\naccounting periods shall be so construed, so that if the two companies\nare  members  of  the  same  group  in  the  surrendering

for which\ngroup  relief  may  be  given,  and  whatever  their  accounting  periods\ncorresponding to that of the surrendering company, obtain in all more\nrelief  than  could  be  obtained  by  a  single  claimant  company  whose\n\n\f17\n\ncorresponding accounting period coincided with the accounting period\nof the surrendering company.\n\nAggregate of claim\n\n23T.(1)\nSubject to subsection (2), two or more claimant companies\nmay make claims relating to the same surrendering company, and to\nthe same accounting period of that surrendering company\n\nNotwithstanding subsection (1) where the claimant companies\n(2)\nreferred to in subsection (1) make claims, the aggregate of the claims\nshall not exceed the amount of the loss surrendered by the surrendering\ncompany.\n\nCapital allowances\n\nA claimant company shall only be eligible to claim group\n23U.\nrelief  where  that  company,  has  first  claimed  all  its  available  capital\nallowances.\n\nTax recovery\n\n23V.\nWhere  the  Commissioner  discovers  that  any  group  relief\nwhich  has  been  given  is  or  has  become  excessive,  he  may  make  an\nassessment to corporation tax in the amount which ought in his opinion\nto be charged.\n\nExempt companies\n\n23W.(1)\n\nGroup relief is not available to\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nany  company\nDevelopment Act, Cap. 318C;\n\nregistered
