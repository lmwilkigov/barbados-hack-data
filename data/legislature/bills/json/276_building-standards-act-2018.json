CONSULT THE BUILDING STANDARDS AUTHORITY IF IN DOUBT.NOTES1. The name and address of the owner is required as under the Building Standards Act, 2018 (Act 2018-    ), as the owner/owner's agent is responsible for the building work. Supervision of the building work is not the responsibility of the Building Standards Authority.\f98\n\nTHE LAWS OF BARBADOSPrinted by the Government Printer, Bay Street, St. Michaelby the authority of the Government of Barbados2. The Building Standards Authority will only grant a building permit if they are satisﬁ ed that the building (building work) will be constructed in accordance with requirements of the Barbados National Building Code. A demolition permit will be granted if the requirements of the Barbados National Building Code are not met. An application should be sent to the address shown above.3. Once we have received your application we will send you a report giving details of any changes to the plans and speciﬁ cations which are needed to comply with the requirements of the Barbados National Building Code. Where possible, these reports will be sent within thirty (30) workings days. Once the plans and speciﬁ cations are altered to the Barbados Building Standards Authority's satisfaction a building permit will be issued, where possible, within ﬁ fteen (15) working days. These response times are always contingent on the cooperation of the applicant.4. If the Barbados Building Standards Authority refuses to grant a building permit you may appeal to the Building Appeal Board within twenty-eight (28) days of the date of the refusal.5. The Barbados Building Standards Authority can advise you on what plans, drawings, speciﬁ cations and other information should accompany your application, also see paragraph 1.23.9 of Part 1 of the Barbados National Building Code.6. The Act enables an applicant for a building permit to submit with his application a design certiﬁ cate (Form 25 and the design considerations related thereto) signed by a suitably qualiﬁ ed and experienced, registered engineer certifying that the relevant engineering aspects of the building work, including the specification of materials to be used, comply with the requirements of the Barbados National Building Code (see paragraph 1.5.4 of the Code). For a building or building work requiring the use of a review consultant(s) (see paragraph 1.8 of the Code) the design certiﬁ cate and the design considerations must bear his/her signature. For further information regarding self certiﬁ cation see Part 1 of the Barbados National Building Code.7. The 'Construction Manual for Detached Houses' (a)  is one method deemed to satisfy Part 5 of the Technical Standards for the construction of a detached house in single occupation and parts of which are not of different purpose groups. If used, the details in this manual must be number referenced to the drawings. In the absence of this information, it will be assumed that the manual has not been Third Schedule (Cont'd)\f99\n\nTHE LAWS OF BARBADOSPrinted by the Government Printer, Bay Street, St. Michaelby the authority of the Government of BarbadosThird Schedule (Cont'd)  used and consequently a design certiﬁ cate from a suitably qualiﬁ ed and experienced registered engineer may be required to support the application. The referenced details in this manual will also be used by building standards ofﬁ cers when conducting inspections of the house during its construction; and (b) may also be used to construct a single or two-storey building of any purpose group provided such a building is constructed within the design limitations of the manual.8. The 'condition of building work' (under Part B) refers to:  (a)  Unauthorised building work, i.e. the building work has started without a building permit when a building permit is required, or building work is done in contravention of an issued building permit when an amendment of building permit is required and the applicant is required to regularise the building work. The fee of 1.25 times the normal rate refers to such occurrences. Disruptive inspections may be needed to determine what has been constructed.  (b) Building work in progress or building work yet to be commenced at the time of enactment. This will occur in the case of persons who were granted planning permission to build prior to the Building Standards Act, 2018 (Act 2018-     ) and who may wish to have their buildings comply   with the Barbados National Building Code. For building work in  progress the fee of 1.25 times the rate is applicable to cover the costs of checking details on site rather than on plan. The Act also provides   for the regularisation of a building which was completed before  enactment. These are voluntary decisions on the part of an owner and require the submission of plans and speciﬁ cations and other particulars as for a normal application. The owner should discuss this matter with the Building Standards Authority to determine its feasibility prior to making such an application.  Under Part X of the Act, the procedures discussed above are referred to as regularisation. Forms 15, 16 and 17 provide further guidance into these procedures.9. For a building sited within the Scotland District, approval is needed from the Soil Conservation Unit. The applicant must provide evidence of such approval.\f100\n\nTHE LAWS OF BARBADOSPrinted by the Government Printer, Bay Street, St. Michaelby the authority of the Government of BarbadosThird Schedule (Concl'd)10.
