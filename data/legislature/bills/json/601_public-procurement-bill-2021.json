of suppliers; and\n\n(c)\n\nsupply the document to any supplier who requests it.\n\n(6)\nWhere a procuring entity engages in pre-qualification proceedings, only\nsuppliers that the entity has pre-qualified are entitled to participate further in the\nprocurement proceedings.\n\nClarification of pre-qualification notices and documents\n\nWhere a procuring entity receives, within a reasonable

present their applications to pre-qualify\nbefore the deadline for submission.\n\nA procuring entity may, prior to the deadline for submitting applications\n(3)\nto pre-qualify, and, where required pursuant to section 7, with the approval of\nthe relevant tenders committee, whether on its own initiative or as a result of a\nrequest for clarification by a supplier, modify a pre-qualification notice or a pre-\nqualification document by issuing an addendum.\n\n\f88\n\n(4)\n\nThe addendum shall\n\n(a)\n\nin the case of\n\n(i)\n\na pre-qualification notice, be published promptly; and\n\n(ii)\n\na pre-qualification document, be communicated promptly to the\nsuppliers  to  whom  the  entity  provided  the  pre-qualification\ndocument; and\n\n(b)\n\nbe binding on the suppliers.\n\nWhere a procuring entity issues a clarification or modification of a pre-\n(5)\nqualification notice or a pre-qualification document, the entity shall, prior to the\ndeadline  for  presenting  applications  to  pre-qualify,  extend,  or  where  required\npursuant  to  section  7,  request  the  relevant  tenders  committee  to  extend  the\ndeadline where necessary in order to afford suppliers sufficient time to take the\nclarification or modification into account in preparing their applications.\n\nThe procuring entity, or where required pursuant to section 7, the relevant\n(6)\ntenders  committee  may,  in  its  absolute  discretion,  prior  to  a  deadline  for\npresenting applications to pre-qualify, extend the deadline where it is not possible\nfor one or more suppliers to present their applications by the deadline because of\nany circumstance beyond their control.\n\n(7)\n\nNotice of an extension of a deadline shall\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nin the case of a pre-qualification notice, be published; and\n\nin the case of a pre-qualification document, be given to all suppliers to\nwhom the entity provided the document.\n\nThe functions of a tenders committee
