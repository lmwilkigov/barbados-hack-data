animal health in Barbados by the implementation\nof  animal  health  and  animal  welfare  standards  in  accordance  with  the  World\nOrganization for Animal Health; and for related matters.\n\nPART I\nPRELIMINARY\n\nClause 1:\n\nClause 1 of the Bill provides for the short title.\n\nClause 2:\n\nClause 3:\n\nClause 2 of the Bill provides for definitions of various terms\nappearing in the Bill. The terms in subsection (1) are aligned\nwith those included in the Glossary to the Terrestrial Animal\nHealth Code and the Glossary to the Aquatic Animal Health\nCode.\n\nPART II\nADMINISTRATION\n\nClause 3 of the Bill in sub-clause (1) establishes the Veterinary\nAuthority  as  the  competent  authority  for  the  regulation  of\nterrestrial  and  aquatic  animal  health  in  Barbados.  It  is\nimportant  to  note  that  the  Veterinary  Authority  is  not  an\nindependent agency but is intended to be a department within\nthe Ministry of Agriculture. Sub-clause (2) provides that the\nhead  of  the  Veterinary  Authority  is  the  Chief  Veterinary\nOfficer.\n\ni\n\n\fClause 4:\n\nClause 5:\n\nClause 6:\n\nAnimal Health and Veterinary Public\nHealth Bill, 2022\n\nClause  4  of  the  Bill  makes  provision  for  the  post  of  Chief\nVeterinary Officer and sets out the role and responsibility of\nthe Chief Veterinary Officer.\n\nClause  5  of  the  Bill  provides  for  the  functions  of  the\nVeterinary Authority and removes any ambiguity regarding\nthe scope of responsibilities of the Veterinary Authority. This\naddresses  a  major  gap  in  the  current  legislation  by\nenumerating the responsibilities of the Veterinary Authority\nwith  respect  to  animal  health.  The  functions  listed  in  sub-\nclause (3) relate to: the obligations established by the World\nOrganization  of  Animal  Health;  trade  (e.g.  risk  analysis,\nequivalence) and other activities relevant to animal health and\nwelfare and veterinary public health.\n\nClause 6 of the Bill provides that the Minister may by order\ndelegate  to  the  Chief  Veterinary  Officer,  any  power  or\nfunction conferred or imposed on him under the Act except\nthe power to make subsidiary legislation. This clause in sub-\nclause  (2)  provides  for  the  Chief  Veterinary  Officer  to\nauthorize  any  public  or  private  veterinarians  or  veterinary\nparaprofessional  to  perform  some  of  the  functions  of  the\nVeterinary Authority. This allows the Veterinary Authority to\nuse veterinarians that are not part of its staff to carry out certain\ntasks and to use staff of other ministries or departments (e.g.\nMinistry  of  Health,  Customs  etc.)  or  private  persons.\nHowever,  certain  functions  must  not  be  delegated,  to\nguarantee  the  independence  and  impartiality  of  the  control\nsystem.  These  exceptions  are  also  stated  in  sub-clause  (2)\nwhich mirrors part of Article 3.4.5 of the Terrestrial Animal\nHealth  Code  on  delegation  of  powers.  The  exceptions  are:\nfunctions  relating  to  official  liaison  duties  with  other\nany  notification\nministries  or\n\nauthorities;\n\nforeign\n\nii\n\n\fClause 7:\n\nAnimal Health and Veterinary Public\nHealth Bill, 2022\n\nresponsibilities  with  trading  partners;  the  approval  of\nstandards,  requirements,  rules  or  sanitary  measures;  or  the\ndesignation  of  emergencies,  free  compartment  zones,  free\nzones, containment zones or infected zones.\n\nlegislation\n\nshould  define\n\nClause  7  of  the  Bill  provides  the  foundation  for  the\nestablishment  of  laboratories  for  the  analysis  of  official\nsamples; and for validating or confirming results or the quality\ncontrol of results. This clause is directly in line with Article\n3.4.7 of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code which stipulates\nrole,\nthat  veterinary\nresponsibilities,  obligations  and  quality  requirements  of\nofficial laboratories, designated by the Veterinary Authority\nfor  carrying  out  the  analysis  of  official  samples;  and  also\nlaboratories  recognized  to  conduct  analyses  required  under\nthe legislation e.g. for the purposes of quality control. This\nclause  is  sufficiently  broad  to  facilitate  the  recognition  of\npublic  or  private  facilities  or  even  those  located  outside  of\nBarbados.  Sub-clause  (3)  establishes  the  standards  under\nwhich  the  operation  of  official  laboratories  and  reference\nlaboratories is to be conducted: impartially and independently.\n\nthe\n\nClause 8:\n\nClause 9:\n\nClause 8 of the Bill enables the Chief Veterinary Officer with\nthe approval of the Minister to designate premises that meet\ncertain  prescribed  requirements  to  be  used  for  veterinary\npurposes.  This  clause  states  that  the  designation  is  not\npermanent and may be amended, cancelled or reinstated at any\ntime.\n\nClause  9  of  the  Bill  makes  provision  for  the  Veterinary\nAuthority to contract the services of veterinarians. Sub-clause\n(2) provides that the terms and conditions of the contract are\nto be determined by the Minister.\n\niii\n\n\fClause 10:\n\nAnimal Health and Veterinary Public\nHealth Bill, 2022\n\nClause  10  of  the  Bill  provides  for  the  appointment  of\ninspectors.  Sub-clause  (2)  provides  for  the  appointment  of\ninspectors in accordance with the Public Service Act, Cap. 29\nand  sub-clause  (3)  makes  provision  for  the  Veterinary\nAuthority to employ inspectors on a contractual basis. Sub-\nclause (4) makes provision that a person appointed to the post\nof inspector may be removed from office in accordance with\nthe Public Service Act, Cap. 29 in circumstances where there\nis a conflict of interest. Where a person contracted to be an\ninspector has any similar conflict of interest, that person will\ncease to be an inspector as a result of the termination of their\ncontract. In this clause the key characteristics of inspectors are\nthat  they  are  duly  qualified  in  terms  of  skills,  training  and\nexperience;  impartial,  independent  and  free  of  improper  or\nundue influence or conflict of interest. Similar characteristics\ncan\nveterinary\nparaprofessionals.  This  clause  provides  that  where  an\ninspector  has  any  interest  in  a  matter  or  action  of  the\nVeterinary Authority, that interest is to be communicated to\nthe Chief Veterinary Officer. Where it is found that the interest\nconflicts  with  the  impartiality  or  independence  of  the\ninspector, the Chief Veterinary Officer may recommend that\nthe appointment of the inspector, be withdrawn.\n\nveterinarians\n\napplied\n\nand\n\nbe\n\nto\n\nClause 11:\n\nClause 11 of the Bill provides for the issue of identification\ncards  to  inspectors  and  that  inspectors  should  have  the\nidentification card in their which possession at all times. This\nclause makes provision that an inspector is required to produce\nhis identification card to any relevant person.\n\nClause 12:\n\nClause 12 of the Bill provides for the Veterinary Authority to\nbe assessed both externally and internally. This is an important\nthe  Veterinary  Authority  can\nmechanism  by  which\n\niv\n\n\fAnimal Health and Veterinary Public\nHealth Bill, 2022\n\nperiodically gauge its performance in the implementation of\nthe Act and in the effectiveness of the measures adopted. In\nsub-clause (3), the Bill provides for collaboration between the\nVeterinary  Authority  and  any  entity  responsible  for\nagricultural health and food control to monitor and evaluate\nthe  implementation  of  the  provisions  and  based  on  the\nfindings, to prepare a report which is to be published in the\nfirst instance, five years after the Act comes into force and\nthereafter at intervals not exceeding 3 years.\n\nPART III\nCONTROL OF ANIMAL DISEASES AND ZOONOSES\n\nClause 13:\n\nClause 14:\n\nClause 13 of the Bill provides that the Veterinary Authority\nis responsible for the development and maintenance of a list\nof notifiable disease for both terrestrial and aquatic animals.\n\nClause 14 of the Bill identifies that it is the responsibility of\nVeterinary  Authority  to  establish  a  surveillance  system  for\nnotifiable diseases or other animal diseases to demonstrate the\nabsence  or  distribution  of  a  disease.  This  clause  also\nestablishes the duty to be transparent in its management of\ndata as it is also the responsibility of the Veterinary Authority\nto determine, report on and make available to the public the\nanimal  health  status  of  Barbados  with  respect  to  animal\ndiseases.  The  World  Organization  for  Animal  Health\nencourages such surveillance systems to be developed having\nregard to: the need to provide assurance of disease status for\ntrade  purposes;  the  resources  of  the  country;  the  financial\nimpact  or  threat  posed  by  the  different  diseases;  and  the\nimportance  of  an  industry-wide  disease  control  programme\nwithin a country or region.\n\nv\n\n\fClause 15:\n\nAnimal Health and Veterinary Public\nHealth Bill, 2022\n\nof\n\nand\n\nparticipation\n\nveterinarians\n\nClause 15 of the Bill provides that the Veterinary Authority\nis  required  to  establish  an  early  detection  system  for  the\npurposes  of  detecting  animal  diseases.  This  clause  is  an\nextension  of  clause  14  as  some  surveillance  systems  are\nestablished as early detection systems. Sub-clause (1) sets out\nthe minimum requirements for an early detection system and\nalso sets out that an effective detection system should involve\nveterinary\nthe\nparaprofessionals,  livestock  owners  and  other  stakeholders\ninvolved  in  the  management  and  handling  of  terrestrial\nanimals; owners and operators of abattoirs; and fish inspectors\nand other persons involved in the handling of aquatic animals\nto detect and report, notifiable disease to report that disease to\nthe  Veterinary  Authority.  Sub-clause  (4)  sets  out  a  key\nrequirement of the Veterinary Authority as indicated in the\nWorld  Organization  for  Animal  Health,  namely,  a  chain  of\ncommand that is as effective as possible. A chain of command\nis important not only to disease response (‘war time’) but also\nto proactive disease surveillance and reporting (‘peace time’)\nas well as on-going regulatory activity. The integrity of the\nchain  of  command  assures  the  credibility  of  the  Veterinary\nAuthority and the international veterinary certificates issued\nin the context of international trade.\n\nClause 16:\n\nClause 16 of the Bill provides for an inspector to take action\nwhere a notifiable disease or an emerging disease is suspected\nor  confirmed  as  immediate  steps  must  be  taken  in  order  to\nprevent the spread of a notifiable or emerging disease. This\nclause  together  with  clause  14,  empowers  inspectors  to  act\nimmediately  to  manage  potential  risks  to  health  pending\nconfirmation by the Chief Veterinary Officer of the presence\nof a notifiable or emerging disease. The action required under\nsub-clause (1) includes the issuing of a written notice to the\n\nvi\n\n\fAnimal Health and Veterinary Public\nHealth Bill, 2022\n\nowner or occupier of the premises. The notice should specify\nthe provisional measures that are to be taken to prevent the\nspread  of  disease.  In  addition,  provisional  measures  may\nrequire that the owner or occupier of the adjacent premises be\nserved with a written notice also specifying the provisional\nmeasures that are to be taken. In each case, the inspector is\nrequired  to  submit  copies  of  any  notice  issued,  to  the\nVeterinary Authority which in turn is to cause an investigation\ninvolving the collection and testing of samples. Sub-clause (3)\nprovides  that  where  a  notifiable  disease  or  an  emerging\ndisease  is  confirmed  the  Veterinary  Authority  shall  issue\nwritten notices stipulating the measures that are to be taken\nand the time within which the measures are to be implemented\nto prevent the spread of disease.\n\nClause 17 of the Bill makes provision for an area or premises\nto be declared an infected area and for that declaration to be\nmade by order by the Minister. Sub-clause (2) requires that\nthe  Chief  Veterinary  Officer  performs  certain  functions\namong  which  is  to  inform  the  competent  authority  for\nveterinary matters in the countries with which Barbados trades\nof the status of the infected area and to suspend the issue of\nveterinary  certificate  for  exports,  in  effect,  recognizing  the\nobligations to trading partners.\n\nClause  18  of  the  Bill  seeks  to  set  out  the  conditions  under\nwhich a declaration of an infected area is to be revoked. The\nconditions are: where the Chief Veterinary Officer determines\nthat the circumstances that gave rise to the declaration of an\ninfected area are no longer present.\n\nClause 17:\n\nClause 18:\n\nClause 19:\n\nClause  19  of  the  Bill  seeks  to  provide  for  animal  disease\ncontingency  plans  in  relation  to  notifiable  diseases  and  the\nimplementation of animal disease control procedures that are\n\nvii\n\n\fAnimal Health and Veterinary Public\nHealth Bill, 2022\n\nconsistent  with  World  Organization  for  Animal  Health\nguidelines.  Sub-clause  (2)  sets  out  what  an  animal  disease\ncontingency plan is to be based on and what such a plan should\ntake account of for example, the capacity for response of the\nVeterinary  Authority;  the  geographical,  ecological  and\nepidemiological environments; animal production and animal\nor animal products marketing practices; and any other factors\nconsidered  necessary  to  control,  contain  or  eradicate  the\nanimal disease. Sub-clause (3) provides for the elements of a\ncontingency plan and sub-clause (4), provides the duties of\nthe Veterinary Authority with respect to the development of\ntraining  programmes  to  ensure  that  there  is  capacity  for\ndisease  diagnosis  and  control  and  the  implementation  of\ndisease  simulation  exercises  to  test  the  effectiveness  of  the\ncontingency  plans.  This  provision  is  important  because  it\nidentifies the responsibility of the Veterinary Authority to lead\nthe response in animal health emergencies, with cooperation\nfrom  other  authorities  for  example,  the  Police  Service,\nministries responsible for public health and the environment,\ndepending on the particular circumstances.\n\nClause  20  of  the  Bill  gives  effect  to  Article  3.4.9  of  the\nTerrestrial Animal Health Code and provides for the response\nof the Veterinary Authority where there is an animal disease\nemergency.  As  the  powers  outlined  in  this  clause  are\nsignificant,  it  is  important  that  the  legislation  is  clear  and\ntransparent  regarding  the  procedures  to  be  followed;  the\ngrounds on which action can be taken, and who may take that\naction.  This  provision  reiterates  the  key  principles  that\nmeasures  must  be  based  on  a  risk  assessment,  ensuring\nmeasures  are  proportional  to  risks  and  that  measures  are\npublicized widely.\n\nviii\n\nClause 20:\n\n\fClause 21:\n\nClause 22:\n\nClause 23:\n\nAnimal Health and Veterinary Public\nHealth Bill, 2022\n\nClause 21 of the Bill seeks to make provision for the Minister\non the advice of the Chief Veterinary Officer to declare by\norder, a zone to be a free zone, a free compartment zone or a\ncontainment zone. However, a declaration can only be made\nif the Veterinary Authority establishes the measures to set up\nthe respective zones.\n\nClause  22  of  the  Bill  sets  out  in  broad  terms  the  scope  of\nresponse  measures  available  to  the  Veterinary  Authority  to\ncontrol or eradicate and to prevent the introduction or spread\nof  animal  diseases.  This  clause  seeks  to  implement  Article\n3.4.9 of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code which stipulates\nthat  veterinary  legislation  should  include  general  animal\nhealth measures applicable to all diseases. This provision does\nnot restrict Veterinary Authority action to notifiable diseases\nbut  special  or  specific  measures  could  apply  to  notifiable\ndiseases. This clause focuses on the different options available\nto the Veterinary Authority such as disinfection, movement\ncontrol, vaccination schemes etc. This provision improves the\ntransparency of the Bill in furtherance of the SPS Agreement\nrequirements  and  World  Organization  for  Animal  Health\nstandards.\n\nClause 23 of the Bill recognizes that moving animals, animal\nproducts or animal related items increase the risk of the spread\nof  disease.  To  limit  the  risk  of  the  spread  of  a  disease,  the\nVeterinary  Authority  must  have  the  power  to  restrict  the\nmovement of animals, animal products or other items that may\nserve as disease carriers. Sub-clauses (2) to (4) enhance the\nprocedural guarantees and transparency of the Bill by setting\nout the actions that are to be taken by an inspector if an item\nthat should not be moved is in fact moved. Where an animal,\nanimal product or animal-related item is moved, an inspector\n\nix\n\n\fClause 24:\n\nClause 25:\n\nClause 26:\n\nAnimal Health and Veterinary Public\nHealth Bill, 2022\n\nunder sub-clause (4) is required to personally serve a notice\non the owner or the person in possession, care or control of\nthe  animal,  animal  product  or  animal-related  item  for  the\npurpose of implementing a remedy.\n\nClause 24 of the Bill imposes an obligation on animal keepers\nwho suspect that an animal in their care is suffering from a\nnotifiable disease, to act in a timely manner in order to prevent\nthe spread of the suspected disease. The two critical elements\nof the obligation under this clause are: separation of the animal\nfrom others; and immediate notification to the authorities.\n\nClause 25 of the Bill allows the Chief Veterinary Officer to\ndisinfect  premises  or  establishments  where  it  has  been\nconfirmed  that  a  notifiable  disease  is  present.  This  clause\nprovides that the Chief Veterinary Officer is empowered to\nchoose the disinfectant to be used and the procedure to be used\nhaving regard for example to the nature of the premises, the\nequipment; and vehicles to be treated. The technical aspects\nof disinfection, such as the chemicals and process used should\nbe included arguably, in operational manuals.\n\nClause  26  of  the  Bill  empowers  an  inspector  to  cause  an\nanimal  infected  or  suspected  of  being  infected  with  a\nnotifiable disease; or has come into contact with or has been\nin the same place as an animal that has a notifiable disease, to\nbe humanely killed in order to prevent the spread of an animal\ndisease. Sub-clause (2) provides for an inspector to exercise\ndiscretion to observe and treat an animal prior to destroying\nit,  for  example  removing  it  to  a  place  for  observation  and\ncontrol.\n\nClause 27:\n\nClause 27 of the Bill provides for the disposal of animals that\nare killed for the purpose of diseases control as a result of an\n\nx\n\n\fClause 28:\n\nAnimal Health and Veterinary Public\nHealth Bill, 2022\n\ninfection with a notifiable disease. According to sub-clause\n(1) such disposal is to be done in a manner that avoids the\nspread of pathogenic organisms. Sub-clause (2) stipulates that\nthe  destruction  and  disposal  of  an  animal  infected  with  a\nnotifiable disease is to be carried out as soon as is practical\nand  according  to  the  direction  of  the  Veterinary  Authority.\nRecognizing the risk involved, sub-clause (3) provides that\nfor  the  purpose  of  disposing  of  an  animal  infected  with  a\nnotifiable  disease,  the  Veterinary  Authority  is  required  to\ncollaborate with the ministries responsible for public health\nand the environment and any other organization as the case\nrequires. Sub-clause (4) provides that the meat of an animal\ninfected with a notifiable disease should be regarded as not fit\nfor human consumption.\n\nClause 28 of the Bill makes provision in sub-clause (1) for the\nMinister on the advice of the Chief Veterinary Officer to order\ncompensation  to  be  paid  to  owners  in  circumstances  for\nexample,  where  an  animal  has  been  destroyed  in  order  to\nachieve eradication, control or prevention of the spread in or\nintroduction of a notifiable disease; where the owners of the\nanimals have complied with the order and directions of the\nVeterinary  Authority;  or  otherwise  comply  with\nthe\nrequirements  of  the  Bill.  Sub-clause  (2)  provides  that\ncompensation  is  not  to  exceed  the  fair  market  value  of  the\nanimal immediately before it was destroyed. Sub-clause (3)\nprovides  that  the  amount  of  compensation  paid  may  be\nreduced or refused where the owner of the animal is found\nguilty of an offence under the Bill. In addition, sub-clause (4)\nprovides that an owner is not entitled to compensation where\nan animal dies or is compulsorily killed while in a quarantine\nstation.\n\nxi\n\n\fClause 29:\n\nAnimal Health and Veterinary Public\nHealth Bill, 2022\n\nPART IV\nVETERINARY PUBLIC HEALTH\n\nClause 29 of the Bill provides the legal foundation for a system\nfor  the  control  of  veterinary  medicinal  products  (including\nanimal  feed  containing  veterinary  medicinal  products)  for\nboth aquatic and terrestrial animals. Sub-clause (1) prohibits\nthe  importation,  sale,  advertisement  and  distribution  of\nveterinary  medicinal  products  in  Barbados  except  they  are\nregistered by the Veterinary Authority. Sub-clause (2) creates\nan exception to sub-clause (1), providing three circumstances\nunder which unregistered veterinary medicinal products may\nbe  imported,  sold,  advertised  or  distributed  in  Barbados.\nThese  circumstances  are  where  there  is  an  animal  disease\nemergency which justifies the importation, production or use;\nthe  Veterinary  Authority  recognizes  that  the  registered\nveterinary medicinal products are insufficient to meet local\nneeds; or for the purpose of testing, trial and research. Sub-\nclause  (3)  also  creates  an  exception  to  sub-clause  (1),\nexempting traditional animal remedies from the requirement\nof registration. Provision is also made in sub-clause (4) for the\nVeterinary Authority and the ministry responsible for public\nhealth  to  co-ordinate  the  registration  and  labelling  of\nveterinary medicinal products so that the systems for which\neach is responsible do not circumvent the other. Moreover, the\nFood and Agricultural Organisation, World Organization for\nAnimal  Health  and\nthe  World  Health  Organisation\nrecommend the co-ordination of controls, including sharing\nlists of approved products and dossiers on active ingredients.\nProvision  is  made  in  sub-clause  (5)  for  the  Veterinary\nAuthority to establish standards and requirement relating inter\nalia  to  the  categories  of  professionals  that  are  entitled  to\nprescribe  veterinary  medicinal  products,  the  conditions  and\n\nxii\n\n\fAnimal Health and Veterinary Public\nHealth Bill, 2022\n\n(6)\n\nfor\n\nin  sub-clause\n\nthe  Minister  on\n\nthe  forms  to  be  used  for  veterinary  products  and  the\ndistribution of veterinary medicinal products. Provision is also\nmade\nthe\nrecommendation of the Chief Veterinary Officer to prohibit\nthe  use  of  ingredients  and  substances  used  as  veterinary\nmedicinal  products  and\nthe  non-therapeutic  use  of\nantimicrobials. Sub-clause (7) provides that for the purposes\nof  the  Bill,  animal  feed  containing  veterinary  medicinal\nproducts  shall  be  considered  as  a  veterinary  medicinal\nproduct.\n\nClause 30:\n\nClause 30 of the Bill seeks to regulate ante-mortem and post-\nmortem inspections at slaughterhouses to control the spread\nof  animal  diseases  and  for  the  benefit  of  veterinary  public\nhealth  by  establishing  Veterinary  Authority  control  over\nfacilities that are established by private operators, or by the\nVeterinary Authority directly. In this clause provision is made\nfor the operation of slaughterhouses to fall within the ambit\nof the Market and Slaughterhouses Act, Cap. 265 and further\nthat failure to comply with the conditions of registration may\ncause operations to be suspended and in serious cases revoked\nwhere  there  is  an  immediate  risk  to  animal,  human  or\nenvironmental health. Sub-clauses (2) to (4) set out the basics\nof  a  registration  system  for  facilities  that  are  not  publicly\noperated,  and  set  out  the  safeguards  to  ensure  that  there  is\ntransparency  and  predictability  in  decision  making,  thus\npreventing arbitrary decision-making while at the same time\nallowing inspectors to shut down premises if there is a risk to\nanimal or human health or the environment. Sub-clause (5)\nsets out a range of areas for which regulations may be made.\nSub-clause  (6)  provides  for  collaboration  between  the\nVeterinary  Authority  and  the  ministry  of  responsible  for\npublic health to ensure that inspection systems meet public\n\nxiii\n\n\fClause 31:\n\nAnimal Health and Veterinary Public\nHealth Bill, 2022\n\nhealth and food safety requirements; and the Markets Division\nto  ensure  that  inspections  meet  the  requirements  under  the\nMarket and Slaugtherhouses Act, Cap. 265.\n\nClause  31  of  the  Bill  seeks  to  provide  that  the  Veterinary\nAuthority  is  under  an  obligation  to  control  the  spread  of\nanimal  diseases  at  knackeries  and  rendering  facilities.\nAccording  to  this  clause,  this  is  to  be  achieved  by\ncollaborating with the ministry responsible for public health\nand the Markets Division of the Markets and Slaughterhouses\nAct, Cap. 265.\n\nClause 32:\n\nClause  32  of  the  Bill  seeks  to  provide  that  the  Veterinary\nAuthority is under an obligation to prevent the introduction\nand spread of zoonotic and emerging diseases.\n\nPART V\nHEALTH PROVISIONS RELATING TO ANIMAL PRODUCTION\n\nClause 33:\n\nClause 33 of the Bill is broad in its scope and in a general way\naddresses all aspects of feed control. In this clause provision\nis made for animal feed and animal feed ingredients to meet\nsafety  standards;  it  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Veterinary\nAuthority  to  issue  the  safety  standards.  Sub-clause  (1)\nprohibits the importation, production, manufacture, sale and\ndistribution of feed in Barbados except it is registered by the\nVeterinary Authority. Sub-clause (2) creates an exception to\nsub-clause  (1),  providing  three  circumstances  under  which\nunregistered  feed  may  be  imported  into  Barbados.  These\ncircumstances  are  where:  there  is  an  animal  disease\nemergency which justifies the importation, production or use;\nthe Veterinary Authority recognizes that the registered animal\nfeed is insufficient to meet local needs; or for the purpose of\ntesting, trial and research. Provision is made in clause (3) for\n\nxiv\n\n\fAnimal Health and Veterinary Public\nHealth Bill, 2022\n\nthe  Veterinary  Authority  to  makes  regulations  to  establish\nstandards  and  requirements  relating  inter  alia  to,  the\ningredients and composition of animal feed, the production,\nmanufacture,  importation  and  exportation  of  animal  feed.\nSub-clause  (4)  prohibits  the  use  of  animal  feed  and  animal\nfeed ingredients in food for human consumption unless they\nmeet the safety standards issued by the Veterinary Authority.\nProvision  is  made  in  sub-clause  (5)  for  the  collaboration\nbetween\nthe  ministry\nresponsible for food safety to set the limits and tolerance levels\nfor  biological,  chemical  or  physical  hazards  in  animal  feed\nand feed ingredients.\n\nthe  Veterinary  Authority  and\n\nClause 34 of the Bill provides that the Veterinary Authority\nis responsible for establishing a system to identify and trace\ncertain species of animals, to be provided for in regulations.\nAccording to sub-clause (2), the Veterinary Authority should\ncollaborate  with  the  ministry  responsible  for  health  when\ndeveloping traceability systems for foods of animal origin, as\nrequired for food safety purposes. Important considerations in\nthe  development  of  the  system  include:  ensuring  the\nconfidentiality of information collected; and ensuring that the\ninformation  is  used  for  the  specified  purposes  i.e.  animal\nhealth and production and human health. It is not to be used\nfor other purposes, such as taxation and levies.\n\nClause  35  of  the  Bill  seeks  to  provide  that  the  Veterinary\nAuthority is responsible for the establishment of conditions\nand requirements governing the reproduction of animals. The\nobjective of this provision is to create a framework to prevent\nthe spread of pathogenic micro-organisms.\n\nxv\n\nClause 34:\n\nClause 35:\n\n\fClause 36:\n\nClause 37:\n\nAnimal Health and Veterinary Public\nHealth Bill, 2022\n\nPART VI\nIMPORT, EXPORT AND TRANSIT\n\nClause  36  of  the  Bill  provides  for  the  establishment  of\nstandards and requirements for the provision and maintenance\nof  facilities  to  accommodate  inspections  of  animals  and\nrelated products at the designated ports of entry. Through this\nprovision, whether the owner of a facility is public or private,\nthe required space and furnishings must be provided to enable\nthe Veterinary Authority to carry out its functions. Sub-clause\n(3) allows for the Minister to serve a notice to the owner or\noperator of an inspection facility of desired improvements to\nan inspection facility where that facility does not comply with\nthe established standards and requirements. An exception is\nmade where the inspection is conducted at a private residence.\nIn  that  case  the  Minister  has  no  jurisdiction  to  cause  any\nimprovements to be made.\n\nClause 37 of the Bill identifies designated ports of entry as the\nonly  points  at  which  an  animal,  animal  product  or  animal-\nrelated item is to enter Barbados. Sub-clause (2) prohibits the\nimportation  of  an  animal,  animal  product  or  animal-related\nitem that does not comply with the provisions of the import\npermit  issued  by  the  Veterinary  Authority  and  is  not\naccompanied by an international veterinary certificate or any\nother document which is required by the Veterinary Authority,\na  provision  which  recognizes  that  not  all  items  require  a\nveterinary certificate and gives the Veterinary Authority the\nflexibility to accept an alternative document. Sub-clause (3)\nallows the Minister to prohibit the importation of an animal,\nanimal  product  or  animal-related  item  to  prevent  the\nintroduction  or  spread  of  any  vector,  pathogen,  disease  or\ntoxic  substance.  Sub-clause  (4)  places  an  obligation  on  the\n\nxvi\n\n\fClause 38:\n\nClause 39:\n\nAnimal Health and Veterinary Public\nHealth Bill, 2022\n\nVeterinary Authority, based on a risk analysis, to develop and\nmaintain a list of animals and animal products the importation\nof which is to be restricted or prohibited on the basis of their\nown decision or that of an international agreement. Sub-clause\n(5) provides the penalty for not complying with the provisions\nof this clause.\n\nClause 38 of the Bill provides in sub-clause (1), the documents\nthat  are  required  to  import  an  animal,  animal  product  or\nanimal-related item into Barbados. They are an international\nveterinary certificate, an import permit or approval in writing\nfrom the Veterinary Authority. Sub-clause (2) provides that\nthe  lists  of  animals  and  animal  products  that  require  an\ninternational  veterinary  certificate  or  import  permit  and\nanimal-related items are to be prescribed by order to facilitate\nand  control  entry  of  different  types  of  animals,  animal\nproducts and animal related items. Sub-clause (2) creates a\ndistinction for animal-related items that would not be subject\nto an import permit and recognizes that because they can serve\nas a disease pathway, that control is necessary. Sub-clause (3)\nreflects the obligations under the SPS Agreement, that import\nrequirements are to be based on international standards or a\nscience-based  risk  assessment.  Also  important  is  that  the\nclause provides that the Veterinary Authority is to keep import\nrequirements under review. Sub-clause (4) makes provision\nfor the making of various import requirements regulations.\n\nClause 39 of the Bill provides that where an import permit is\nrequired,  an  application  is  to  be  made  to  the  Veterinary\nAuthority. There is a fee attached. Sub-clause (4) provides that\nthe  Veterinary  Authority  is  required  to  have  regard  for  the\nimport requirements when evaluating an application. This is\nimportant for the transparency and predictability of the permit\n\nxvii\n\n\fClause 40:\n\nClause 41:\n\nAnimal Health and Veterinary Public\nHealth Bill, 2022\n\nissuance process to reduce the likelihood of arbitrary decision\nmaking. Sub-clause (5) establishes the duty of the Veterinary\nAuthority to keep records of applications and the issuance of\nimport permits.\n\nClause 40 of the Bill places the obligation on the importer to\ninform the Veterinary Authority in advance of the arrival of\nanimals, animal products or animal related items.\n\nClause  41  of  the  Bill  seeks  to  makes  provision  for  the\nmandatory  inspections  at  designated  ports  of  entry.  Sub-\nclause (2) is a practical measure that allows for inspections to\ntake place in facilities other than quarantine stations or border\ninspection facilities, where such places have prior approval\nfrom  the  Veterinary  Authority.  Sub-clause  (3)  makes\nprovision for the place and times for which an inspection may\ntake place, either at a designated port of entry during regular\nbusiness  hours  or,  with  the  approval  of  the  Veterinary\nAuthority,  at  the  port  of  final  destination.  Sub-clause  (4)\nallows  for  animal-related  items  that  do  not  require  prior\nwritten  approval  to  be  submitted  for  inspection  at  the\ndesignated  ports  of  entry.  Sub-clause  (5)  provides  for  an\ninspector  to  release  an  animal,  animal  product  or  animal-\nrelated item for clearance to a customs officer or the importer\nor person in charge of the shipment where it is found not to\npose a risk for the introduction and spread of disease. This\nclause  also  prevents  a  customs  officer  from  releasing  an\nanimal,  animal  product  or  animal  related  item  without  the\napproval of the Veterinary Authority. Sub-clause (7) specifies\nthat  a  written  notice  should  normally  be  provided  to  the\nimporter, but if urgent action is required, the inspector may\ntake  any  required  action  and  notify  the  importer  after  such\naction  has  been  taken.  Sub-clause  (8)  provides  that  an\n\nxviii\n\n\fAnimal Health and Veterinary Public\nHealth Bill, 2022\n\ninspector may forego the required notice and apply any of the\nmeasures provided for in sub-clause (7). This sub-clause also\nimposes the duty on the inspector to inform the importer in\nwriting of the reasons why notice was not given. Sub-clause\n(9) makes clear provisions for the destruction of shipments\nthat are not claimed. Sub- clause (10) is a reiteration of the\nprinciple that all actions should be based on an assessment of\ndisease  risks.  Sub-clause  (11)  is  important  to  protect  the\nVeterinary Authority from liability for actions taken in good\nfaith to prevent the introduction and spread of diseases into\nBarbados.\n\nClause 42 of the Bill provides that the cost of the care and\nwelfare of any animal subject to a pre-shipment inspection and\nany  measures  applied  by  an  inspector  in  the  course  of  an\ninspection of an imported animal, animal product or animal-\nrelated item suspected of posing a risk of the introduction and\nspread of disease is to be borne by the importer.\n\nClause 43 of the Bill provides for the Veterinary Authority to\ndetermine  with  an  exporting  country  any  arrangements\nrelating to pre-shipment inspections and the equivalence of\nanimal health measures. This is an important principle of the\nSPS Agreement and is designed to facilitate trade, where the\nVeterinary  Authority  recognizes  the  measures  taken  by  its\ntrading  partners,  offer  the  same  protection  as  its  own\nmeasures. Article 5.3 of both the Terrestrial Animal Health\nCode and the Aquatic Animal Health Code devotes significant\nattention to the concept of making equivalence judgments.\n\nClause 44 of the Bill seeks to provide the circumstances under\nwhich an inspector may refuse entry to an animal or animal-\nrelated  item  which  is  suspected  of  being  infected  with  a\nnotifiable  disease  or  other  infectious  disease.  In  addition,\n\nxix\n\nClause 42:\n\nClause 43:\n\nClause 44:\n\n\fClause 45:\n\nClause 46:\n\nAnimal Health and Veterinary Public\nHealth Bill, 2022\n\nprovision is made for the procedures which an inspector must\nfollow  in  circumstances  where  the  suspected  disease  is\ncapable  of  being  treated.  Provision  is  also  made  for  the\ncircumstances in which an animal or animal related item may\nbe seized and disposed.\n\nClause  45  of  the  Bill  corresponds  to  Chapter  5.5  of  the\nTerrestrial  Animal  Health  Code  and  Chapter  5.7  of  the\nAquatic Animal Health Code and sets out the procedures for\napplying to the Veterinary Authority for a transit permit. Sub-\nclause (5) contributes to the predictability and clarity of the\nsystem by enumerating the actions that can be taken and the\ngrounds for doing so to verify the health status of an animal,\nanimal product or animal- related item. Transit may be denied,\nfor example if certain diseases exist in the exporting country,\nor in a transit country which precedes it in the itinerary; or if\non arrival, an inspection shows that the animal is affected by\na notifiable disease. Sub-clause (6) provides that an owner or\nperson  in  charge  of  the  animal,  animal  product  or  animal-\nrelated item is not to be compensated where any measure is\napplied. Sub-clause (7) places an obligation on the captain of\na vessel carrying animals, animal products or animal-related\nitems to comply with prescribed by the Veterinary Authority\nwhere the vessel stops in a port in Barbados or transits through\na port in Barbados to a port outside Barbados.\n\nClause 46 of the Bill empowers public officers other than the\nVeterinary Authority to detain imports of prescribed products,\nand to inform the Veterinary Authority of their arrival to the\ncountry as soon as possible. An item detained by any of the\npersons listed in sub-clause (1) is to be treated as an action on\nthe  behalf  of  the  Veterinary  Authority  and  the  item  to  be\n\nxx\n\n\fClause 47:\n\nClause 48:\n\nAnimal Health and Veterinary Public\nHealth Bill, 2022\n\ndetained is to be conveyed to the Veterinary Authority within\n3 days.\n\nClause 47 of the Bill seeks to provide for the conditions and\nrequirements relating to the issue of a veterinary certificate.\nSub-clause (1) prohibits the exportation of an animal product\nor animal-related item from a place other than a designated\nport of exit and without a veterinary certificate issued by the\nVeterinary Authority. In sub-clause (2) provision is made for\nmandatory  inspections  as  a  condition  to  the  issue  of  a\nveterinary certificate for export. Sub-clause (3) provides that\nthe  Veterinary  Authority  in  the  course  of  an  inspection  is\nrequired to consider the requirements of the importing country\nand  should  not  issue  a  veterinary  certificate  if  the  animal,\nanimal  product  or  animal  related  item  does  not  meet  the\nrequirements of the importing country. In addition, provision\nis  made  for  an  exporter  to  remedy  any  instances  of  non-\ncompliance with the requirements of an importing country by\nsubjecting the animal, animal product or animal-related item\nto treatment in order to comply with the requirements of the\nimporting  country.  Sub-clause  (4)  provides  factors  that  the\nVeterinary  Authority  considers  in  determining  whether  to\nissue an international veterinary certificate.\n\nClause 48 of the Bill makes provisions for quarantine stations\nfor terrestrial animals and is aligned with Chapter 5.6 of the\nTerrestrial  Animal  Health  Code,  in  particular  Article  5.6.2.\nThis  clause  provides  that  quarantine  stations  should  be\nrecommended by the Chief Veterinary Officer and designated\nby  the  Minister.  While  a  quarantine  station  is  most  likely\npublic,  the  wording  of  the  clause  allows  for  flexibility  to\ndesignate  private  facilities  that  meet  prescribed  standards\neither as a permanent quarantine facility or on a temporary or\n\nxxi\n\n\fAnimal Health and Veterinary Public\nHealth Bill, 2022\n\nrestricted basis. The key elements of this clause are that these\nfacilities are to meet prescribed standards and are to be under\nthe oversight or supervision of the Veterinary Authority even\nif the day-to-day operations are contracted or assigned to the\nprivate sector.\n\nClause 49 of the Bill applies only to terrestrial animals. Sub-\nclause (1) sets out the grounds for which an animal may be\nplaced in quarantine. Those grounds are: for the purpose of\ntrade;  or  where  an  inspector  has  reason  to  believe  that  an\nanimal  while  being  transported  may  be  suffering  from  a\nnotifiable  disease  or  other  contagious  animal  disease;  may\nhave  been  in  contact  with  an  animal  which  is  or  may  be\nsuffering from a notifiable disease or other contagious disease\nor one whose disease status is unknown; or has otherwise been\nexposed  to  the  risk  of  contracting  a  notifiable  or  other\ncontagious disease. Sub-clause (2) empowers an inspector to\neither  seize  and  detain,  destroy  or  otherwise  dispose  of  an\nanimal  if  that  animal  is  removed  from  quarantine  without\nwritten authorization. Sub-clause (3) empowers an inspector\nto  destroy  an  animal  as  a  result  of  specific  causes  listed\nwithout payment of compensation to the owner and sub-clause\n(4) reiterates the right of the Veterinary Authority to impose\nquarantine as an import condition.\n\nClause 50 of the Bill seeks to protect the welfare and safety\nof  animals  and  to  prevent  the  spread  of  disease  by  making\nprovision  for  the  Veterinary  Authority  to  regulate  the\nconditions under which animals are transported by vehicles.\n\nClause  51  of  the  Bill  seeks  to  provide  for  the  methods\navailable  to  the  Veterinary  Authority  to  dispose  of  waste\narising from foods of animal origin, animal-related items or\nother items associated with the transport of animals aboard a\n\nxxii\n\nClause 49:\n\nClause 50:\n\nClause 51:\n\n\fAnimal Health and Veterinary Public\nHealth Bill, 2022\n\nvehicle coming into Barbados. This clause provides that the\nwaste may be destroyed at the expense of the importer at the\nport of entry; reshipped to the country of origin, at the expense\nof the importer or denied entry into Barbados; the method will\nbe determined based on the requirements established by the\nVeterinary Authority.\n\nPART VII\nANIMAL WELFARE\n\nClause 52 of the Bill prohibits the mistreatment of and cruelty\nto animals and in particular prohibits an owner of an animal\nfrom allowing a third party to cause suffering to an animal.\nThis provision is primarily directed at terrestrial animals. Sub-\nclause (3) provides the penalty for torturing, beating, injuring,\nmutilating,  neglecting,  cruelly  treating  any  animal  or\noverloading any working animal.\n\nClause 53 of the Bill seeks to make provision for the welfare\nof terrestrial animals. Sub-clause (1) is aligned with Article\n7.1.2 of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code, which contains\nguiding  principles  for  animal  welfare,  including  the  “five\nfreedoms”  which  are  stated  at  paragraph  (a)  to  (e)  of  sub-\nclause (1). Sub-clause (2) makes provision for the Veterinary\nAuthority  to  prescribe  animal  welfare  standards  and  aligns\nwith  chapter  7  of  the  Terrestrial  Animal  Health  Code.  The\nstandards relating to animal welfare are extensive and include:\nfarms, transportation, slaughter and production\n\nClause  54  of  the  Bill  seeks  to  make  provision  for  the\nVeterinary  Authority  to  prescribe  aquatic  animal  welfare\nstandards for farmed fish. The welfare standards for farmed\nfish  included  in  this  clause  relate  to  aquaculture  facilities;\ntransportation; killing of farmed fish for human consumption\n\nxxiii\n\nClause 52:\n\nClause 53:\n\nClause 54:\n\n\fClause 55:\n\nClause 56:\n\nAnimal Health and Veterinary Public\nHealth Bill, 2022\n\nor  to  control  disease;  research  and  testing,  recreation,\nentertainment and companionship.\n\nPART VIII\nMANAGEMENT OF STRAY ANIMALS\n\nClause 55 of the Bill allows for the Veterinary Authority to\nensure that stray animals do not spread diseases and do not\nbecome a public nuisance or hazard. Sub-clause (3) requires\nco-operation  among  different  stakeholders  for  the  proper\nimplementation  of  this  clause.  The  Veterinary  Authority\nshould work in cooperation with other agencies, the private\nsector  to  establish  programmes.  Article  7.7.4  expressly\nrecognizes the role of other authorities in collaborating with\nthe Veterinary Authority in the implementation of programs.\nArticle  7.7.3  guides  what  the  objectives  are  of  a  control\nprogram  and  article  7.7.6  sets  out  control  measures.  The\ncontrol  of  stray  livestock  may  be  a  responsibility  of  the\nVeterinary  Authority,  insofar  as  this  relates  to  control  of\nlivestock diseases.\n\nPART IX\nENFORCEMENT\n\nClause 56 of the Bill is an extensive and important provision\nwhich  seeks  to  provide  robust  powers  to  inspectors  in\naccordance with Article 3.4.5 of the Terrestrial Animal Health\nCode.  The  powers  listed  are  extensive  but  necessary  for\ninspectors to carry out their duties inter alia stopping the sale\nand distribution of animals and animal products. It is to be\nborne in mind that the robust powers granted to inspectors are\nto  protect  the  rights  of  stakeholders  and  the  general  public\nagainst any abuse of authority Sub-clause (4) indicates that\n\nxxiv\n\n\fAnimal Health and Veterinary Public\nHealth Bill, 2022\n\ndwelling  places  are  excluded  (on  Constitutional  grounds)\nunless an inspector obtains a warrant, and sub-clause (5) is an\nadditional safeguard for the public by requiring all inspectors\nto identify themselves and show their identification card, and\nimportantly  not  disclose  any  confidential  information.\nRecognizing  the  risks  that  may  be  associated  with  entering\nand searching premises, provision is made in sub-clause (6)\nfor a member of the Police Service to accompany an inspector\nin the execution of his duties.\n\nClause 57 of the Bill provides for the guiding principles on\nwhich  measures  and  requirements  should  be  based.  This\nclause seeks to incorporate Articles 2.2, 3 and 5 of the SPS\nAgreement, to establish the basis on which sanitary measures\nare developed and implemented in Barbados. Sub-clause (1)\nlists  that  measures  are  to  be  harmonized  with  international\nstandards, technically based on risk assessments and science-\nbased  decisions;  be  favourable  to  the  development  of\nregionalization; be favourable to trade and proportionate to\nthe risk. These principles must directly inform and shape the\nmeasures that are implemented under the Bill. Sub-clause (2)\nplaces the obligation on the Veterinary Authority to keep the\nmeasures under review every 3 years to ensure they are current\nwith frequently evolving international standards.\n\nClause  58  of  the  Bill  empowers  inspectors  to  issue  written\nnotices  setting  out  the  grounds  for  which  corrective  action\nmust  be  taken  and  the  time  period  for  complying  with  the\norder.  Ensuring  that  this  is  done  in  writing  protects  the\nindividual against whom the notice is written and ensures the\nspecific  date  is  captured.  Manuals  and  Standard  Operating\nProcedures can further detail the specifics that must be set out\nin the written notice. However, the latter is provided for in\n\nxxv\n\nClause 57:\n\nClause 58:\n\n\fClause 59:\n\nClause 60:\n\nClause 61:\n\nAnimal Health and Veterinary Public\nHealth Bill, 2022\n\nparagraph (d) of sub-clause (1) where a notice serves to inform\nthe violator of the facts, the date and nature of the offence and\nthe assessed sanction. Notice is served prior to the imposition\nof  a  penalty  so  as  to  afford  the  accused  a  reasonable\nopportunity  to  object,  either  in  writing  or  in  person.  In\naddition, an offender is granted the right to appeal a decision\nunder clause 62.\n\nClause 59 of the Bill reiterates some of the powers set out in\nthe foregoing clauses. This clause seeks to allow an inspector\nto direct the owner of the animal, animal product or animal-\nrelated item to move it to a place specified by the inspector\nand  gives  the  inspector  an  alternative  option  to  directly\nconfiscate the item.\n\nClause 60 of the Bill seeks to prohibit any person whose item\nis  confiscated  or  detained  by  an  inspector,  to  attempt  to\nrecover or move the item in a manner contrary to the written\nauthority of the Veterinary Authority.\n\nClause 61 of the Bill seeks to make provision for the detention\nand disposal of animals, animal products and animal-related\nitems.  Where  an  animal,  animal  product  or  animal-related\nitem  is  seized  and  detained  by  an  inspector,  sub-clause  (1)\nrequires  that  the  Veterinary  Authority  returns  the  animal,\nanimal product or animal-related item where it is found that\nthe provisions of the Bill are not breached and that there is no\nrisk of the spread of disease. This creates a safeguard for the\npublic not to have an item detained without cause and also\nprotects the Veterinary Authority when having to dispose of\nitems that are not in compliance with the Bill. In addition, sub-\nclause (2) provides that where an animal, animal product or\nanimal-related  item  is  seized  and  detained,  the  Veterinary\nAuthority  has  the  power  to  institute  proceedings  to  sell  or\n\nxxvi\n\n\fClause 62:\n\nAnimal Health and Veterinary Public\nHealth Bill, 2022\n\ndestroy  that  animal  or  animal-related  item  if  the  owner  or\nperson in charge of the item cannot be identified. The time-\nframe  within  which  the  Veterinary  Authority  may  institute\nproceedings is to be prescribed by regulations. Sub-clause (3)\nallows  the  Veterinary  Authority  to  dispose  an  animal  or\nanimal product to prevent the possible spread of disease and\nsub-clause  (4)  allows  for  the  sale  or  destruction  of  an\nunclaimed animal where the Authority serves notice on the\nowner to claim the animal.\n\nClause 62 of the Bill makes provision for a two-tier system of\nreview where any person is aggrieved by a decision or action\ntaken by an inspector or an official analyst. In the first instance\nan  aggrieved  person  may  appeal  in  writing  to  the  Chief\nVeterinary  Officer  within  7  days  of  any  decision  or  action\ntaken.  Sub-clause  (2)  provides  that  the  Chief  Veterinary\nOfficer  is  required  to  give  a  decision  on  technical  matters\nwithin  14  days  after  receiving  the  appeal.  Sub-clause  (3)\nprovides that an appeal of an action or a decision of the Chief\nVeterinary Officer is to be made to the Minister within 7 days\nafter the decision. According to sub-clause (4) the Minister’s\ndecision is to be given within 14 days of receiving the appeal.\nIn addition, sub-clause (5) provides that an aggrieved person\nmay appeal to a Judge in Chambers from a decision given by\nthe Chief Veterinary Officer or the Minister, on a matter of\nlaw. Sub-clause (6) requires that the Chief Veterinary Officer\nacts in a timely manner in responding to a appeal involving a\nnotifiable disease.\n\nxxvii\n\n\fClause 63:\n\nClause 64:\n\nClause 65:\n\nClause 66:\n\nAnimal Health and Veterinary Public\nHealth Bill, 2022\n\nPART X\nOFFENCES AND PENALTIES\n\nClause 63 of the Bill seeks to list the specific actions that are\nto  be  treated  as  criminal  offences  and  the  corresponding\npenalties. The penalties range from a fine of $100 000 to $200\n000 or to imprisonment for a term of 2 years or to both. Under\nthis clause, offences are to be tried summarily.\n\nClause 64 of the Bill lists the categories of behaviour that are\nto be treated as offences for an inspector, official analyst or\nother  official  of  the  Veterinary  Authority,  where  that\nbehaviour  is  outside  of  their  authority.  These  behaviours\ninclude a failure to take action, as well as more specifically,\nabuse of power, taking bribes, failing to disclose a financial\ninterest.  Sub-clause  (3)  provides  the  penalties  to  which  an\ninspector, official analyst or other official of the Veterinary\nAuthority\nineligible  for  reappointment  or\ndisciplinary action under the Public Service Act, Cap. 29.\n\nis  subject:\n\nClause 65 of the Bill makes provision for how contraventions\nof the provisions of the Bill are to be treated. Under this clause,\nan  inspector  is  under  an  obligation  to  inform  the  Chief\nVeterinary Officer where he reasonably believes that there has\nbeen a contravention. Sub-clause (2) provides that the Chief\nVeterinary Officer may determine whether the contravention\nwarrants  criminal  prosecution,  an  administrative  penalty  or\nboth.\n\nto\n\nissue  administrative  penalty  notices\n\nClause  66  of  the  Bill  seeks  to  provide  for  the  Veterinary\nAuthority\nin\ncircumstances where it is satisfied that the act which a person\nhas  committed  does  not  warrant  criminal  prosecution.  An\nadministrative penalty provides an enforcement mechanism,\n\nxxviii\n\n\fAnimal Health and Veterinary Public\nHealth Bill, 2022\n\nwhich can be more cost-effective, timely and practical than\ncriminal  penalties.  Sub-clause  (1)  provides  the  following\nforms of penalties: the suspension or revocation of any permit\nor  other  authorization;  the  suspension  or  closure  of  the\noperations of an establishment; the seizure or confiscation of\nan  animal,  animal  product  or  animal-related  item.  In  these\ncircumstances sub-clause (2) makes provision for an inspector\nto  issue  an  administrative  penalty  notice,  setting  out  the\nreasons for the sanction and an obligation to pay a fine not\nexceeding $10 000. Sub-clause (3) makes provision for appeal\nwhere a person to whom an administrative penalty notice is\naddressed  and  who  wishes  to  challenge  the  notice.  Sub-\nclauses (4) makes provision for the revocation of a business\nlicence  in  cases  of  repeated  violations.  Sub-clause  (5)\nprovides  that  where  a  person  fails  to  comply  with  the\nprovisions  of  an  administrative  notice  and  that  failure  to\ncomply results in the spread of disease or poses a serious risk\nto  the  animal  health  status  of  Barbados,  that  establishment\nmay be closed or any licence issued may be cancelled.\n\nClause  67  of  the  Bill  sets  out  the  matters  that  the  Chief\nVeterinary Officer may settle administratively and includes\nthe  seizure  of  animals,  animal  products  or  animal-related\nitems and the restoration of anything seized under the Bill.\n\nClause 68 of the Bill provides for the issue of fixed penalty\nnotices for offences prescribed in regulations as fixed penalty\noffences. Sub-clause (2) provides the maximum penalty for a\nfixed penalty offence. Sub-clause (3) sets out the procedure\nfor the issue of a fixed penalty notice. Sub-clause (4) describes\nthe consequences where a person to whom a notice is issued,\npays the fine or fails to pay the fine. Sub-clause (5) describes\nthe form of and particulars to be contained in a fixed penalty\n\nxxix\n\nClause 67:\n\nClause 68:\n\n\fAnimal Health and Veterinary Public\nHealth Bill, 2022\n\nnotice.  Sub-clause  (6)  makes  provision  for  the  Chief\nVeterinary Officer to extend the period for the payment of the\nfixed  penalty  notice.
