It   is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the luminous efficacy of   monochromatic radiation of frequency 540 × 1012 Hz, Kcd, to be 683 when expressed   in the unit lm W–1, which is equal to cd sr W–1, or cd sr kg–1 m–2 s3, where the kilogram,   metre and second are deﬁ ned in terms of h, c and ∆vCs.

Derived Units(1) Derived units are deﬁ ned as products of powers of the base units. When the numerical factor of the product is one, the derived units care called coherent derived units. The base and coherent derived units of the SI form a coherent set, designated the set of coherent SI units. Since there are a limitless number of quantities it is impossible to provide a complete list of derived units however the most commonly used derived units are provided in paragraphs (2), (3) and (4).(2) The 22 SI derived units with special names and symbols.First Schedule - (Cont'd)Derived Quantityplane anglesolid anglefrequencyforcepressure, stressenergy, work, quantity of heatpower, radiant ﬂ uxelectric charge,quantity of electricityelectric potential diﬀ erence (e), volt electromotive forcecapacitanceSpecial name of unitRadian (b)Steradian (c)Hertz (d)newtonpascaljoulewattcoulombvoltfaradSymbolradsrHzNPaJWCVFUnit expressed in terms of base units (a)m/mm2/m2s-1kg m s-2kg m-1 s-2kg m2 s-2kg m2 s-3A skg m2 s-3 A-1kg-1 m-2 s4 A2Units expressed in terms of other SI UnitsN mJ/sW/AC/V\f56\n\n L.R.O. 1998First Schedule - (Cont'd)Derived Quantityelectric resistanceelectric conductancemagnetic ﬂ uxmagnetic ﬂ ux densityinductanceCelsius temperatureluminous ﬂ uxilluminanceactivity (of a radionuclide)absorbed dose, speciﬁ c energy (impacted), kermadose equivalentcatalytic activitySpecial name of unitohmsiemensweberteslahenrydegree Celsius (f)lumenluxbecquerel graysievertkatalSymbolΩSWbTH°ClmlxBqGySvkatUnit expressed in terms of base units (a)kg m s-3 A-2kg-1 m-2 s3 A2kg m2 s-2 A-1kg s-2 A-1kg m2 s-2 A-2Kcd srcd sr m-2s-1m2 s-2m2 s-2mol s-1Units expressed in terms of other SI UnitsV/AA/VV sWb/m2Wb/ACd srLm/m2J/kgJ/kg  (a) The order of symbols for base units in this Table is diﬀ erent from that in the 8th    edition following a decision by the CCU at its 21st meeting (2013) to return to the    original order in Resolution 12 of the 11th CGPM (1960) in which newton was    written kg m s−2, the joule as kg m2 s−2 and J s as kg m−2 s−1.   The intention was to reﬂ ect the underlying physics of the corresponding quantity    equations although for some more complex derived units this may not be   possible.\f57\n\n L.R.O. 1998  (b) The radian is the coherent unit for plane angle.  One radian is the angle subtended    at the centre of a circle by an arc that is equal in length to the radius.  It is also the    unit for phase angle.  For periodic phenomena, the phase angle increases by 2π rad    in one period.  The radian was formerly an SI supplementary unit, but this category    was abolished in 1995.  (c) The steradian is the coherent unit for solid angle.  One steradian is the solid angle    subtended at the centre of a sphere by an area of the surface that is equal to the    squared radius.  Like the radian, the steradian was formerly an SI supplementary    unit.  (d) The hertz shall only be used for periodic phenomena and the becquerel shall    only be used for stochastic processes in activity referred to a radionuclide.  (e) Electric potential diﬀ erence is also called “voltage” in many countries, as well    as “electric tension” or simply “tension” in some countries.  (f) The degree Celsius is used to express Celsius temperatures. The numerical    value of a temperature diﬀ erence or temperature interval is the same when    expressed in either degrees Celsius or in kelvin.  (g) In photometry the name steradian and the symbol sr are usually retained in    expressions for units.  (h) Activity referred to a radionuclide is sometimes incorrectly called radioactivity.  (i) See CIPM Recommendation 2 on the use of the sievert (PV, 2002, 70, 205).(3) The seven base units and 22 units with special names and symbols may be   used in combination to express the units of other derived quantities. Since the   number of quantities is without limit, it is not possible to provide a complete list   of derived quantities and derived units. Subsection (4) provides some examples   of derived quantities and the corresponding coherent derived units expressed in   terms of base units.  In addition, subsection (5) provides examples of coherent derived   units whose names and symbols also include derived units.  The complete set of SI units   includes both the coherent set and the multiples and sub-multiples formed by using   the SI preﬁ xes.First Schedule - (Cont'd)\f58\n\n L.R.O. 1998(4) Examples of coherent derived units expressed in terms of base units.

(b) For some applications such as in astronomy, small angles are measured in    arcseconds (i.e. seconds of plane angle), denoted as or ″, milliarcseconds,    microarcseconds and picoarcseconds, denoted mas, μas and pas, respectively,    where arcsecond is an alternative name for second of plane angle.  (c) The unit hectare and its symbol ha, were adopted by the CIPM in 1879    (PV, 1879, 41). The hectare is used to express land area.  (d) The litre and the symbol lower-case l, were adopted by the CIPM in 1879 (PV,    1879, 41). The alternative symbol, capital L, was adopted by the 16th CGPM    (1979, Resolution 6; CR, 101 and Metrologia, 1980, 16, 56-57) in order to    avoid the risk of confusion between the letter l (el) and the numeral 1 (one).  (e) The tonne and its symbol t, were adopted by the CIPM in 1879 (PV, 1879, 41).    This unit is sometimes referred to as “metric ton” in some English-speaking    countries.\f62\n\n L.R.O. 1998First Schedule - (Concl'd)  (f) The dalton (Da) and the uniﬁ ed atomic mass unit (u) are alternative names    (and symbols) for the same unit, equal to 1/12 of the mass of a free carbon 12    atom, at rest and in its ground state. This value of the dalton is the value    recommended in the CODATA 2014 adjustment. It will be updated in the    CODATA 2018 adjustment to take into account the, now ﬁ xed, 2017 value of    the Planck constant h. This will reduce the 2014 uncertainty by an order of    magnitude.  (g) The electronvolt is the kinetic energy acquired by an electron in passing through   a potential diﬀ erence of one volt in vacuum. The electronvolt is often combined    with the SI preﬁ xes.  (h) In using these units it is important that the nature of the quantity be speciﬁ ed    and that any reference value used be speciﬁ ed.\f63\n\n L.R.O. 1998SECOND SCHEDULE(Sections 15(2), 25(3) and 25(4))Barbados Metrology Act, 2021(Act 2021-     )Non - SI Units of Practical ImportanceQuantity1. lengthNameinchSymbolinDeﬁ nition0.9144/36 mUse(a) Automotive tyres and rims;(b) Equipment used, or intended for use, in the manufacturer and repair of automotive tyres or rims;(c) Precision pipes, precision tubes, precision ﬁ tting and precision screw threads;(d) Spare parts for equipment  constructed using equipment other than metric measurements;(e) Equipment used for, or intended for use in, the manufacture of  equipment referred to in paragraphs (c) or (d);(f) Defence equipment;(g) Equipment used, or intended for use, in aviation;(h) Equipment used, or intended for use, in the computer industry;(i) Equipment used, or intended for use, in the electronics industry; or\f64\n\n L.R.O. 1998Second Schedule - (Cont'd)Quantity2. length3.
